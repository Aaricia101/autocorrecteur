NEW YORK MIINING DISASTER
By MURAKAMI Haruki
Translated by Philip Gabriel
They blew out their lamps to save on air, and darkness surrounded them. No one spoke. All they could
hear in the dark was the sound of water dripping from the ceiling every five seconds.
“O.K., everybody, try not to breathe so much. We don't have enough air left,” an old miner said. He
held his voice to a whisper, but even so the wooden beams on the ceiling of the tunnel creaked faintly. In
the dark, the miners huddled together, straining to hear one sound. The sound of pickaxes. The sound
of life.
They waited for hours. Reality began to melt away in the darkness. Everything began to feel as if it were
happening a long time ago, in a world far away. Or was it happening in the future, in a different far-off
world?
Outside, people were digging a hole, trying to reach them. It was like a scene from a movie.
A friend of mine has a habit of going to the zoo whenever there's a typhoon. He's been doing this for
ten years. At a time when most people are closing their storm shutters or running our to stock up on
mineral water or checking to see if their radios and flashlights are working, my friend wraps himself in
an army-surplus poncho from the Vietnam War, stuffs a couple of cans of beer into his pockets, and
sets off. He lives about a fifteen-minute walk away.
If he's unlucky, the zoo is closed, “owing to inclement weather,” and its gates are locked. When this
happens, my friend sits down on the stone statue of a squirrel next to the entrance, drinks his lukewarm
beer, and then heads back home.
But when he makes it there in time he pays the entrance fee, lights a soggy cigarette, and surveys the
animals, one by one. Most of them have retreated their shelters. Some stare blankly at the rain. Others
are more animated, jumping around in the gale-force winds.
Some are frightened by the sudden drop in barometric pressure; others turn vicious.
My friend makes a point of drinking his first beer in front of the Bengal tiger cage. (Bengal tigers
always react the most violently to storms.) He drinks his second one outside the gorilla cage. Most of
the time the gorillas aren't the least bit disturbed by the typhoon. They stare at him calmly as he sits like
a mermaid on the concrete floor sipping his beer, and you'd swear they actually felt sorry for him.
“It's like being in an elevator when it breaks down and you're trapped inside with strangers,” my friend
tells me.
Typhoons aside, my friend's no different from anyone else. He works for an export company,
managing foreign investments. It's not one of the better firms, but it does well enough. He lives alone in
a neat little apartment and gets a new girlfriend every six months. Why he insists on having a new one
every six months (and it's always exactly six months) I'll never understand. The girls all look the same,
as if they were perfect clones of one another. I can't tell them apart.
My friend owns a nice used car, the collected works of Balzac, and a black suit, a black tie, and black
shoes that are perfect for attending funerals. Every time someone dies, I call him and ask if I can borrow
them, even though the suit and the shoes are one size too big for me.

“Sorry to bother you again,” I said the last time I called. “Another funeral's come up.
“Help yourself. You must be in a hurry,” he answered. “Why don't you come over right away?”
When I arrived, the suit and tie were laid out on the table, neatly pressed, the shoes were polished, and
the fridge was full of cold imported beer. That's the kind of guy he is.
“The other day I saw a cat at the zoo,” he said, opening a beer.
“A cat?”
“Yeah, two weeks ago. I was in Hokkaido on business and dropped by a zoo near my hotel. There was
a cat asleep in a cage with a sign that said ‘Cat.' “
“What kind of cat?”
“Just an ordinary one. Brown stripes, short tail. And unbelievably fat. It just plopped down on its side
and lay there.”
“Maybe cats aren't so common in Hokkaido.”
“You're kidding, right?” he asked, astonished. “There must be cats in Hokkaido. They can't be that
unusual.”
“Well, look at it another way: why shouldn't there be cats in a zoo?” I said.
“They're animals, too, right?”
“Cats and dogs are your run-of-the-mill-type animals. Nobody's going to pay money to see them,” he
said. “Just look around you-they're everywhere. Same thing with people.”
When we'd finished off a six-pack, I put the suit and tie and shoebox into a large paper bag.
“Sorry to keep doing this to you,” I said. “I know I should buy my own suit, but somehow I never get
around to it. I feel like if I buy funeral clothes I'm saying it's O.K. if somebody dies.”
“It's no problem,” he said. “I'm not using them anyway. It's better to have someone use them than to
have them hanging in the closet, right?”
It was true that in the three years since he'd had the suit made he'd hardly worn it.
“It's weird, but since I got the suit nor a single person I know has died,” he explained.
“That's the way it goes.”
“Yes, that's the way it goes,” he said.
For me, on the other hand, it was the Year of Funerals. Friends and former friends died one after
another, like ears of corn withering in a drought. I was twenty-eight. My friends were all about the same
age—twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine. Not the right age to die.
A poet dies at twenty-one, a revolutionary or a rock star at twenty-four. But after that you assume that
everything is going to be all right. You've made it past Dead Man's Curve and you're out of the tunnel,
cruising straight for your destination down a six-lane highway-whether you want to be or not. You get
your hair cut; you shave every morning. You aren't a poet anymore, or a revolutionary or a rock star.
You don't pass out drunk in phone booths or blast the Doors at four in the morning. Instead, you buy
life insurance from your friend's company, drink in hotel bars, and keep your dental bills for medical
deductions. That's normal at twenty-eight.
But that was exactly when the unexpected massacre started in our lives. It was like a surprise attack on a
lazy spring day—as if someone, on top of a metaphysical hill, holding a metaphysical machine gun, had
sprayed us with bullets. One minute we were changing our clothes, and the next minute they didn't fit
anymore: the sleeves were inside out, and we had one leg in one pair of pants and the other in a different
pair. It was a mess.
But death is just that. A rabbit is a rabbit whether it springs out of a hat or a wheat field. A hot oven is a
NEW YORK MINING DISASTER http://web.archive.org/web/20030316094045/www.geocities.com/os...

hot oven, and the black smoke rising from a chimney is what it is—black smoke rising from a chimney.
The first person to straddle the divide between reality and unreality (or unreality and reality) was a friend
from college who taught English at a junior-high school. He'd been married for three years, and his wife
had gone back to her parents' house in Shikoku to have their baby.
One unusually warm Sunday afternoon in January, he went to a department store and bought two cans
of shaving cream and a German-made knife that was big enough to lop off an elephant's ear. He went
home and ran a bath. He got some ice from the refrigerator, downed a bottle of Scotch, climbed into the
tub, and slit his wrists. His mother found his body two days later. The police came and took a lot of
photographs. Blood had dyed the bath the color of tomato juice. The police ruled it a suicide. After all,
the doors had been locked, and, of course, the deceased had bought the knife himself. But why did he
buy two cans of shaving cream that he didn't plan to use? No one knew.
Maybe it hadn't hit him when he was at the department store that in a couple of hours he'd be dead. Or
maybe he was afraid that the cashier would guess that he was going to kill himself.
He didn't leave a will or a note. On the kitchen table there was only a glass, the empty whiskey bottle
and ice bowl, and the two cans of shaving cream. While he was waiting for the bath to fill, knocking
back glass after glass of Haig-on-the-rocks, he must have stared at those cans and thought something
along the lines of I'll never have to shave again.
A man's death at twenty-eight is as sad as the winter rain.
During the next twelve months, four more people died.
One died in March in an incident at an oil field in Saudi Arabia or Kuwait, and two died in June—a
heart attack and a traffic accident. From July to November there was peace, but then in December
another friend died, also in a car crash.
Unlike my first friend, who'd killed himself, these friends never had time to realize that they were dying.
For them it was like climbing up a staircase they'd climbed a million times before and suddenly finding
a step missing.
“Would you make up the bed for me?” the friend who died of a heart attack had asked his wife. He was
a furniture designer. It was eleven o'clock in the morning. He'd woken up at nine, worked for a while in
his room, and then said he felt sleepy. He went to the kitchen, made some coffee, and drank it. But the
coffee didn't help. “I think I'll take a nap,” he said. “I hear a buzzing sound in the back of my head.”
Those were his last words. He curled up in bed, went to sleep, and never woke up again.
The friend who died in December was the youngest, and the only woman. She was twenty-four, like a
revolutionary or a rock star. One cold rainy evening just before Christmas, she was flattened in the
tragic yet quite ordinary space between a beer-delivery truck and a concrete telephone pole.
A few days after the last funeral, I went to my friend's apartment to return the suit, which I'd picked up
from the dry cleaner's, and to give him a bottle of whiskey to thank him.
“Much obliged. You've helped me out once again,” I said.
As usual, his fridge was full of cold beer, and his comfortable sofa reflected a faint ray of sunlight. On
the coffee table there was a clean ashtray and a pot of Christmas poinsettias.
He accepted the suit, in its plastic covering, his movements leisurely—like those of a bear just coming
our of hibernation—and quietly put it away.
“I hope the suit doesn't smell like a funeral,” I said.
“Clothes aren't important. The real problem is what's inside them.”

“Um,” I said.
“One funeral after another for you this year,” he said, stretching out on the sofa and pouring beer into a
glass. “How many all together?”
“Five,” I said, spreading out the fingers of my left hand. “But I think that's got to be it.”
“Are you sure?”
“Enough people have died.”
“It's like the curse of the Pyramids or something,” he said. “I remember reading that somewhere. The
curse continues until enough people have died. Or else a red star appears in the sky and the moon's
shadow covers the sun.
After we finished a six-pack, we started on the whiskey. The winter sunlight sloped gently into the
room.
“You look a little glum these days,” he said.
“Really?” I said.
“You must be thinking about things too much in the middle of the night,” he said. “I've stopped
thinking about things at night.”
“How'd you manage that?”
“When I get depressed, I start to clean. Even if it's two or three in the morning. I wash the dishes, wipe
off the stove, mop the floor, bleach the dish towels, organize my desk drawers, iron every shirt in
sight,” he said, stirring his drink with his finger. “I do that till I'm exhausted, then I have a drink and go
to sleep. In the morning I get up and by the time I'm putting on my socks I can't even remember what it
was I was thinking about.”
I looked around again. As always, the room was clean and orderly.
“People think of all kinds of things at three in the morning. We all do. That's why we each have to
figure out our own way of fighting it off”
“You're probably right,” I said.
“Even animals think things over at 3 A.M.,” he said, as if he were remembering something. “Have you
ever gone to a zoo at 3 A.M.?”
“No,” I answered vaguely. “No, of course not.”
“I've only done it once. A friend of mine works at a zoo, and I asked him to let me in when he had the
night shift. You're not supposed to, really.” He shook his glass. “It was a strange experience. I can't
explain it, but I felt as if the ground had silently split open and something was crawling up out of it. And
then there was this invisible thing on a rampage in the dark. It was as if the cold night air had
coagulated. I couldn't see it, but I felt it, and the animals felt it, too. It made me think about the fact that
the ground we walk on goes all the way to the earth's core, and I suddenly realized that the core has
sucked up an incredible amount of time.”
I didn't say anything.
“Anyway, I never want to go again—to the zoo in the middle of the night, I mean.”
“You prefer a typhoon?”
“Yeah,” he said. “I'll take a typhoon any day.”
The phone rang and he went to his bedroom to take the call. It was his girlfriend clone, with an endless
clone phone call. I wanted to tell him I was going to call it a day, but he was on the phone forever. I
gave up waiting and switched on the TV. It was a twenty-seven-inch color set with a remote control, the
kind you barely have to touch to change the channel. The TV had six speakers and great sound. I'd
NEW YORK MINING DISASTER http://web.archive.org/web/20030316094045/www.geocities.com/os...

never seen such a wonderful TV.
I made two complete rounds of the channels before settling on a news program. A border clash, a fire,
exchange rates going up and down, a new limit on car imports, an outdoor winter swim meet, a family
suicide. All these bits of news seemed somehow connected, like people in a high-school-graduation
photo.
“Any interesting news?” my friend asked as he came back into the room.
“Not really,” I said.
“Do you watch a lot of TV?”
I shook my head. “I don't have a TV.”
“There's at least one good thing about TV,” he said after a while. “You can shut it off whenever you
like. And nobody complains.”
He pushed the “Off” button on the remote control. Immediately, the screen went blank. The room was
still. Outside the window, lights in other buildings were starting to come on.
We sat there for five minutes, drinking whiskey, with nothing to talk about. The telephone rang again,
but he pretended not to hear it. Just as the phone stopped ringing, he hit the “On” button, as if he'd
suddenly remembered something. The picture returned instantly, and a commentator standing in front of
a graph gestured with a pointer as he explained changes in the price of oil.
“See? He didn't even notice that we'd switched him off for five minutes.”
“True enough,” I said.
“Why is that?”
It was too much trouble to think it through, so I shook my head.
“When you switch it off, one side ceases to exist. It's us or him. You just hit the switch and there's a
communications blackout. It's easy.”
“That's one way of thinking of it,” I said.
“There are millions of ways of thinking. In India they grow coconut trees. In Argentina it rains political
prisoners from helicopters.” He switched the TV off again. “I don't want to say anything about other
people,” he said, “but consider the fact that there are ways of dying that don't end in funerals. Types of
death you can't smell.”
I nodded silently. I felt that I knew what he was getting at. At the same time, I felt that I had no idea
what he meant. I was tired and a bit confused. I sat there, fingering one of the poinsettia's green leaves.
“I've got some champagne,” he said earnestly. “I brought it back from a business trip to France a while
ago. I don't know much about champagne, but this is supposed to be great. Would you like some?
Champagne might be just the thing after a string of funerals.”
He brought out the chilled champagne bottle and two clean glasses and set them quietly on the table,
then smiled slyly. “Champagne's completely useless, you know,” he said. “The only good part is the
moment you pop the cork.”
“I can't argue with you there,” I said.
We popped the cork, and talked for a while about zoo in Paris and the animals that live there. The
champagne was excellent.
There was a party at the end of the year, an annual New Year's Eve party at a bar in Roppongi, which
had been rented for the occasion. A piano trio played, and there was a lot of good food and drink. When
I ran across someone I knew, I'd chat for a while. My job required that I put in an appearance every
year. Parties aren't my thing, but this one was easy to take. I had nothing else to do on New Year's Eve
NEW YORK MINING DISASTER http://web.archive.org/web/20030316094045/www.geocities.com/os...

and could just stand by myself in a corner, relax, have a drink, and enjoy the music. No obnoxious
people, no need to be introduced to strangers and listen to them rant for half an hour about how a
vegetarian diet cures cancer.
But that evening someone introduced me to a woman. After the usual small talk, I tried to retreat to my
corner again. But the woman followed me back to my seat, whiskey glass in hand.
“I asked to be introduced to you,” she said amiably.
She wasn't the type to turn heads, though she was certainly attractive. She was wearing an expensive
green silk dress. I guessed that she was about thirty-two. She could easily have made herself look
younger, but she didn't seem to think it was worth the trouble. Three rings graced her fingers, and a
faint smile played on her lips.
“You look exactly like someone I know,” she said. “Your facial features, your back, the way you talk,
the over-all mood—it's an amazing likeness. I've been watching you ever since you came in.
“If he's that much like me, I'd like to meet the guy,” I said. I had no idea what else to say.
“You would?”
“I'd want to see what it feels like to meet someone who's exactly like me.”
Her smile deepened for an instant, then softened. “But it's impossible,” she said. “He died five years
ago. When he was about the same age you are now.
“Is that right?” I said.
“I killed him.”
The trio was just finishing its second set, and there was a smattering of halfhearted applause.
“Do you like music?” she asked me.
“I do if it's nice music in a nice world,” I said.
“In a nice world there is no nice music,” she said, as if she were telling some vital secret. “In a nice
world the air doesn't vibrate.”
“I see,” I said, not knowing how to respond.
“Have you seen the movie where Warren Beatty plays the piano in a night club?”
“No, I haven't.”
“Elizabeth Taylor is one of the customers at the club, and she's really poor and miserable.”
“Hmm.”
“So Warren Beatty asks Elizabeth Taylor if she has any requests.”
“And does she?”
“I forget. It's a really old movie.” Her rings sparkled as she drank her whiskey. “I hate requests. They
make me feel unhappy. It's like when I take a book out of the library. As soon as I start to read it, all I
can think about is when I'll finish it.”
She put a cigarette between her lips. I struck a match and lit it for her.
“Let's see,” she said. “We were talking about the person who looked like you.”
“How did you kill him?”
“I threw him into a beehive.”
“You're kidding, right?”
“Yes,” she said.
Instead of sighing, I took a sip of whiskey. The ice had melted and it barely tasted like whiskey
anymore.
“Of course, legally I'm not a murderer,” she said. “Or morally, either.”
“Neither legally nor morally a murderer.” I didn't want to, but I reviewed the points she'd made. “But
NEW YORK MINING DISASTER http://web.archive.org/web/20030316094045/www.geocities.com/os...
7 of 7 05-08-05 01.37
you did kill someone?”
“Right.” She nodded happily “Someone who looked just like you.”
Across the room a man let out a loud laugh. And the people around him laughed, too. Glasses clinked. It
sounded very far away but extremely clear. I don't know why, but my heart was pounding, as if it were
expanding or moving up and down. I felt as if I were walking on earth that was floating on water.
“It took less than five seconds,” she said. “To kill him.”
We were silent for a while. She was taking her time, savoring the silence.
“Do you ever think about freedom?” she asked.
“Sometimes,” I said. “Why do you ask?”
“Can you draw a daisy?”
“I think so. Is this a personality test?”
“Almost.” She laughed.
“Well, did I pass?”
“Yes” she answered. “You'll be fine. Nothing to worry about. Intuition tells me you'll live a good long
life.”
“Thank you,” I said.
The band began playing ‘Auld Lang Syne.”
“Eleven-fifty-five,” she said, glancing at the gold watch on her pendant. “I really like ‘Auld Lang Syne.'
How about you?”
“I prefer ‘Home on the Range.' All those deer and antelope.”
She smiled again. “You must like animals.”
“I do,” I said. And I thought of my friend who likes zoos and of his funeral suit.
“I enjoyed talking to you. Goodbye.”
“Goodbye,” I said.

About the Author
AUTHOR NOTE
Dear Reader,
I fell in love with reading at a young age. My grandmother was a reader.
My mother was a reader. They passed their love of reading on to me. While
I enjoyed a good thriller or mystery, I quickly realized what type of books I
liked reading the best—romance.
My love for hockey came later in life, but my passion for the game
rivals my love of romance books.
I'd wanted to write a hockey romance for a long, long time, but I was
also scared to combine my love of hockey and my love of romance because
what if I took something fun I enjoyed and turned it into a job, then started
to hate it?
Spoiler alert: That did NOT happen.
Writing hockey romances makes me love the game even more, and I
already really love it.
So, what you're about to read is a combination of my passions for
romance and hockey, and I hope you can feel that between these pages.
The Carolina Comets will forever hold a special place in my heart
because they were my first (but not my last). I hope you enjoy this group of
goofballs and their women who (barely) put up with them.
Love,
Teagan

COLLIN
“No, no, no…”
Smoke billows from under the hood of my old beat-up Land Cruiser
that has certainly seen better days. With a groan, I navigate it onto the
shoulder, and just as I get the last tire off the main road, the car dies
completely.
Dread sinks into my gut.
I'm more capable of handling a hockey stick than a wrench, but even I
know smoke like this isn't a good sign.
I sigh and yank up the emergency brake, then slam my hand against the
steering wheel in frustration. I've already been stranded in a podunk town
for two days while I had to wait on new tires to be delivered to replace my
two popped ones.
Now, less than four hours from home, I'm fucked again.
I knew driving the old beater vehicle across the country probably wasn't
the best idea. I should have listened to my pops when he suggested I flatbed
it. He knew the car wouldn't make the trek from the middle of nowhere
Kansas all the way to North Carolina.
I was determined to have the last few days of my break to myself
though. Just me and the open road, nothing but my thoughts to keep me
company.
Turns out that was a bad idea too because my thoughts suck as much as
this car does.
The end of last season has been on perpetual repeat in my brain, and
I've spent the entire drive thinking of all the things I could have done
differently to not cost us the Stanley Cup.
Such as not taking a penalty just moments before the end of the tied
regulation, which led to a goal and the loss of Game Six in overtime. After
we won Game One, we were feeling good, ready to take it to the end. But
after losing Games Two, Three, and Four—in overtime, no less—we were
feeling defeated. We rallied for Game Five and barely scraped by with a
win, but that spark was back. Then Game Six happened and we folded like
a house of cards at the last minute, blowing the series.
It was a total punch to the heart.
I wish I could say that was the worst of it for me.
A car speeds by, shaking the SUV and pulling me from recalling one of
the worst moments of my life.
I don't need to take a trip down memory lane. Right now, I need to
figure out what the hell I'm going to do to get back home. Coach expects
the team to report tomorrow at 8 AM, and after letting him down last
season, I can't be late. This year has to go better than last. I have a contract
on the line. I need to get my shit together, prove I'm worth the time and
money. I want to stay with the Comets, and I'll do whatever it takes to make
that happen.
I pop the hood and hop out of the car to take a look at the damage.
When I peer in at the engine, it's obvious I'm not going anywhere
anytime soon. There's errant fluid, and a low hiss echoes on the otherwise
quiet road; it's coming from around where the smoke is rising.
A tow is definitely in order.
I wipe my hands off on my jeans—something my mom would kill me
for if she saw me—and round the car to grab my phone from the cup holder.
I search for the nearest mechanic and hit GO on the results.
And I wait.
Then wait some more.
Nothing.
There's not enough service to get the results to load.
I walk up and down the road, but it's no use. I'm in the middle of
nowhere. There's nothing for miles.
With my frustration growing, I trek back to my car and survey the area.
I'm not sure what I'm looking for. A rescue maybe? I didn't pass many cars
when driving, so I'm not expecting anyone to come flying down the road
anytime soon.
I'm about an hour and a half from sunset, maybe less, and I think there
was an exit about five or so miles back. If I hustle, I can probably make it
before it gets too dark out.
“Fuck it,” I mutter to nobody but myself. “I'll walk.”
Hell, maybe it'll be good for me. Help clear my head.
I grab my wallet from the center console and a flashlight out of the
glovebox just in case I need it, then lock up the car.
I shoot off a text to Rhodes, the one guy on the team who doesn't want
to choke the shit out of me, hoping it'll go through eventually and he can
send someone to help.
I slip my phone into my back pocket and, somehow—despite having
done it a hundred times before—I miss.
The overpriced hunk of metal crashes to the ground. I don't even have
to pick it up to know the screen is shattered because that's just the kind of
luck I have lately.
Not that I give a shit about the phone being broken. I can buy another
with no problem.
My issue is that everything that could possibly go wrong since blowing
the Cup has gone wrong.
The week after we lost, a few guys from the team—the ones still talking
to me—got together at a local bar to drown our sorrows. After one too many
drinks were slung around, a brawl ensued after I witnessed some asshole
manhandling a woman.
I did the right thing. I stepped in and handled shit.
But guess who got slapped with the cuffs after it was all said and done?
Me. That's fucking who.
Luckily the asshole ended up dropping the charges when the truth about
what started the fight came out.
The damage was done though. I was branded a hothead when the press
began digging into my past, and a file that should have been clean suddenly
wasn't.
Two arrests for assault? Not a good look on the team.
With my name and face being splashed across headlines and social
media, Coach suggested I lie low for the summer, get my head on straight
before the upcoming season. So, I packed my bag and headed out west to
my parents' farm.
The flight out to my parents' house? Rescheduled…twice. To top it off,
my luggage was lost, and I ended up having to wear my brother's too-small
clothes the first three days I was there.
Mom forgot to mention she turned my old bedroom into an office, so I
crashed on the same lumpy, uncomfortable couch we've had since I was in
middle school. At six foot three, the couch is the last place I need to be
sleeping. That first week home was spent with a kink in my neck, and I
swear it's still fucked up.
That was just the beginning of the shitstorm that would follow.
I thought going back home for the summer would be good for me,
thought being away from the city I let down would be for the best. I could
put the loss and the gossip behind me and get my mind right. But
everything that could go wrong did, and the more shit went wrong, the more
I couldn't help but think it was all my fault somehow.
I pinch my nose between my fingers, inhaling and exhaling slowly to
remain calm.
Figuring shit out under pressure isn't typically a problem for me. You
don't become a first-round draft pick in the NHL by not being able to
handle the heat.
But today, my ability to stay cool is being tested beyond belief.
First my car, now my phone.
“Can't just one thing go right for a change?”
With a huff, I snatch my phone off the ground to assess the damage.
As expected, the screen is toast. But the real kick in the nuts?
It won't turn on.
“Just fucking great.” Now if my text did somehow go through to
Rhodes, he's not going to have any way to get ahold of me.
Fury races through me and I want nothing more than to smash the
useless device against a tree, but I refrain.
Instead, I set off down the road again, keeping my head down, making
sure to stay far away from the two-lane highway. The sky grows darker a lot
faster than I anticipated, and I've misjudged either how long I have until
sundown or how far back this exit is.
I walk about a mile before I see headlights pop over a hill in the
distance. Whoever it is, they're flying.
And that worries me because the closer they creep to the edge of the
road, the closer they're getting to me.
Does the universe hate me so much that I'm about to get mowed down
in the middle of nowhere with nobody to witness it? Where they likely
wouldn't find my body for days?
The driver isn't showing any sign of slowing or moving over.
I slow my gait as they approach, ready to jump out of the way if I have
to. And I really fucking think I'm going to have to.
Just when I'm sure I'm going to have to dive into the ditch for safety, a
loud squeal pierces the air as they slam on their brakes, fishtailing all over
the road.
The car skids another thirty yards or so before coming to a complete
stop.
I'm paralyzed.
I can't move. Can't look away from the car that's now just sitting in the
middle of the road.
What the hell just happened?
The sky is still bright enough that I can see the driver's form in the car.
Can see them sitting there unmoving, likely in the same state of shock I'm
in.
Finally, they shake their head and ease their foot off the brake.
Are they just going to drive away? After they almost hit me? Just like
fucking that?
I take two steps toward the vehicle, ready to—fuck, I don't even know
what I'm going to do. Yell at them? Chase them down? That'd be stupid.
Plus, I don't need to get in any more trouble than I'm already in.
But I'm pissed. Who almost hits a person, then just drives off like it's
nothing?
I stop walking when the car slowly eases onto the shoulder and the
driver kills the engine.
Guess they are going to stop after all.
I wait for whoever it is to make the first move. To roll down the window
and ask if I'm okay. To get out and apologize. To do anything other than sit
there. It's too dark to see into the car completely, but I can feel them staring
at me in the rearview mirror.
I stare back, my anger growing by the second.
I swear it's hours before the door finally pops open.
“What the hell is your problem?” I lay into them the moment the door is
ajar. “Do you have any idea how close you were to hitting me? You could
have kil—”
I try to rein in my surprise when a woman who can't be more than five
foot five steps out of the car and turns to face me.
She shoves long, wavy strands of hair out of her face. She's still a good
twenty feet away, but I can see the shock in her eyes from here. Her jaw is
dropped, hands shaking at her sides.
She takes a step toward me. Then another.
She stops at the back of her car and stares at me with wide eyes.
But it's not the same wide-eyed stare I get from fans. There's no sign of
recognition on her face.
She looks terrified out of her mind. Like she's scared of me.
Ridiculous considering I'm the one who almost got dead.
We stare at one another for several beats, not saying a peep. It's calm
out here, not much of a breeze. Nothing to fill the silence between us except
her quiet breaths.
I don't know what the etiquette is here. Just moments ago I was ready to
lay into her, but the look she's giving me…
“I, uh…”
A pause.
Ten seconds pass.
“I…” She tries again, her tongue darting out to wet her lips. She pulls
the bottom one between her teeth, trapping it there while she mulls over
what she's going to say next.
A sigh.
And finally, “Are you okay?”
Her voice is soft. Timid.
I nod.
“I…I didn't see you. And then I did. But I thought…I thought you
weren't real.”
I tilt my head. “Not real?”
My voice comes out gruffer than I intend, probably from not talking to
anyone for so long. She looks as surprised as I do by the sound of it.
“You know, the stories about this road. I thought you were the Ghostly
Drifter.”
“Ghostly Drifter?”
I have no fucking clue why I'm just repeating the ends of her sentences.
She doesn't seem to mind.
“You haven't heard the stories?”
I shake my head.
She wrings her hands, eyes darting around, taking in the heavily
wooded area around us. “Well, supposedly, along this stretch of highway, a
drifter roams. He's said to show up around dusk, and he only appears to
people who are alone. He flags you down, claiming his car broke down, and
asks for a ride. If you let him into your car, you're giving him permission.”
“Permission for what?”
“To eat your soul. It's said he absorbs all the good parts of you, leaving
all the bad behind. Everyone who has reported picking him up has
committed a horrific crime in the weeks following.”
“That…sounds like a load of shit.”
She huffs out a laugh. “But I've never seen anyone wandering these
roads before tonight, and well…” She lifts her shoulders. “Freaked me out.
Probably because I was listening to Strange, Dark, and Mysterious.”
“You listen to Johnny?”
Her eyes widen with shock and she grins. “You're a fan of the podcast?”
“I listen to him all the time during…” I pause, not wanting to reveal too
much about who I am. I have no idea who this woman is. She's not showing
any signs of recognizing me, but she could be playing me. It wouldn't be
the first time it's happened. “When I'm on a plane,” I finish.
“Fly a lot?”
“Sometimes more than I'd like.”
Silence falls between us again, and she's back to wringing her hands.
She's nervous, but I can't tell if it's me making her feel that way or that we
both just almost experienced a life-altering thing.
“I…I really am sorry,” she says quietly. Her voice is barely above a
whisper, but it carries over to me with ease.
I'm just now realizing how quiet this stretch of the road really is. And
after her story—even though it's total bullshit—it's kind of creepy being out
here.
“What are you doing out here?”
“My car broke down.”
A soft squeak leaves her lips, and I can't help but chuckle.
“I'm not the drifter guy, I promise.”
Her eyes narrow. “That sounds exactly like what he'd say.”
“Well, I guess the only way you'll know is to let me into your car.”
Her face falls, and she takes a step back from me.
“Fuck.” I lift the backward cap on my head, running a hand through my
hair before replacing it. “That sounded creepy as shit, didn't it?”
She nods.
“Look,” I say, taking a step toward her. She steps back again, and I
pause, realizing I'm likely scaring the crap out of her right now. “I've been
on the road since six this morning, and now my car is broken down. I tried
calling for a tow truck but lost signal. Then I dropped my phone, and
because nothing these days is made like it once was, it's broken. So now
I'm stranded. I saw an exit a couple of miles back and was walking that
way when I almost got run over.”
She grimaces, her face telling me she's sorry for that.
“It's just been a long day,” I tell her. “I'm tired and frustrated and just
want to get where I'm going so I can crash. So thanks for not hitting me.
I'm fine. You're fine.” I toss my thumb over my shoulder. “I'm going to get
going before I lose any more light.”
I turn on my heel and shove my hands into my pockets, keeping my
head up just in case someone else decides to come barreling down the hill
and almost kill me.
What a fucking day.
And now I'm going to be out here in the pitch dark.
Fuck do I hope my flashlight doesn't give out on me.
“Wait!”
I hear the crunch of gravel under her shoes as she gets closer.
I spin back around, waiting.
“I…” She sighs. “That exit you saw? That's at least fifteen miles back.”
“What? Are you sure?” I could have sworn it wasn't more than two
miles.
But everything out here does look the same…
She nods. “I've driven this road a hundred times. It's the exit for
Springsville. The next exit that way”—she points the way she was heading
—“is another ten miles.” She drops her hand, tucking it into her back
pocket and rocking back on her heels. “We're in a really rural area, and the
cell service is notorious for being nonexistent. You picked a really bad place
to break down.”
Awesome. Good to know I was walking in the wrong direction.
“Where are you headed?”
It's on the tip of my tongue to tell her, but I don't think that would be
the smartest thing to do. For all I know, she could be the Ghostly Drifter.
Don't be an idiot, Col. There's no such thing as ghosts.
“Near Jonesville,” I say instead. It's not exactly where I'm going, but
it's a town over.
“I'm headed to Bartlett. That's on my way…”
Is she… “Are you offering to give me a ride all the way there?”
She shrugs. “I did almost run you over. It only seems right.”
“I could be dangerous.”
She tips her head to the side, watching me closely.
I can't clearly see the color of her eyes from here, but I'm betting it's
something brilliant.
“I don't think you are.”
I'm not, but… “You don't know me.”
“Are you trying to convince me that you are dangerous?”
“No. I just think that since—”
“I'm a woman, I'm helpless and incapable of handling myself?” She
crosses her arms over her chest, cocking her hip out. She stares at me with
hard eyes. “I have a gun in my glovebox.”
She looks so tough right now, like she isn't going to take this from me. I
like that she's standing up for herself, but still… “I wasn't going to say that.
But also, you shouldn't tell me where you keep your weapon.”
She tucks her lips together. “That's fair. Though I could be lying about
it…”
I get the feeling she's not.
“Do you want a ride or not?”
I really hate that she's offering a ride to a complete stranger, but I'm
glad the complete stranger is me.
“It's a Sunday,” she says. “Repair shops are going to be closed. What
are you going to do? Try to hang around some place until someone can
come get you?”
Hanging around in public for hours doesn't sound appealing. I have no
fucking clue where I am and now no phone to get ahold of someone.
“All right,” I agree. “A ride would be great. I can call for a tow later.”
She gives me a single nod and heads for the car.
We make it four steps before she whirls around again.
This time I'm much closer to her, the closest I've been yet.
Her eyes are bright blue, so bright they're almost white. Her lips are
pouty and full, the bottom one just slightly larger than the top. Her nose is
small and upturned at the end, but not in a distracting way. It's…cute.
She's cute.
“What's your name?”
“Huh?” I draw my eyes away from her mouth, back to her eyes that are
trained on me with caution.
“Your name?”
“It's…Collin.”
“Why didn't you sound sure of that? Is that a fake name?”
“It's not.” I'm just not entirely used to someone not knowing who I am.
“My name is Collin. My friends call me Col.” I leave out my last name on
purpose.
“Collin.” She tests my name on her lips, like she's trying to decide if
she likes it or not. She sticks her hand out to me. “Harper.”
“Nice to meet you, Harper.” I take her hand in mine, noting how small it
is compared to my giant paws. Her skin is soft too. “Thank you for not
running me over.”
A grin pulls at the corner of her lips. “Come on. We still have about a
four-hour drive ahead of us.”
“Uh, should I drive? I'm not entirely sure I trust your night vision.”
Those white-blue eyes narrow. “Gun, remember?”
“Right, in the glovebox. I remember.”
She turns on her heel, making her way to the driver's side of the little
white Honda.
That's when I spot it.
A Carolina Comets bumper sticker.
Fuck me.
She really didn't seem like she recognized me at all, but maybe she's
just a really good actress? I have nothing to base that on. I don't know her.
Which makes me even more of an idiot for willingly getting into the car
with her.
She must notice me hesitating.
“Are you memorizing my license plate?”
I already did. “No. I, uh, noticed the sticker. Hockey fan?”
She lets out a single laugh. “No. Not into sports at all. It came with the
car.” She lifts her shoulders. “Are you?”
“You could say I'm a fan.”
“Oh great.” She rolls her eyes as I make my way to the passenger door.
“Just please don't talk my ear off about it the entire drive or I'm likely to
fall asleep at the wheel.”
This is going to be a long four hours.

HARPER
You never realize how long a mile is until you're sitting in silence with a
stranger you just almost hit with your car.
I am now well aware of just how much it feels like forever as the quiet
stretches between us.
Holy shit. I can't believe I almost hit someone.
I really can't believe that same someone is now sitting in my passenger
seat.
And I lied to him.
There's no such thing as the Ghostly Drifter.
I was totally screwing around with my stereo, trying to get my auxiliary
cord to sit right so my podcast would stop cutting out. But making up some
story felt better than admitting I was one of those assholes who play with
their phone while they're driving.
I steal a glance over at him.
He's tall, so tall that when he folded himself into the car, his knees were
against the dash. He leaned the seat back so his head wasn't brushing the
ceiling too. His shoulders are wide, and he's taking up every inch of his side
of the car and some of mine.
He's turned his baseball cap forward, and I'm a little disappointed by
the way it covers his eyes. They're a bright green, and I'm sad I won't ever
get to see them in the daylight because I'm betting the color is gorgeous.
His hands are big too as they rest on his jean-clad thighs. They're veiny,
but not in that way that's too veiny. More in the way that a nurse would
look at hands and think, Wow. That's some serious nurse porn right there.
I'm trapped in this car with this gorgeous man who smells like leather
and something else I can't quite place my finger on.
He's sitting so still it's making me uncomfortable.
“So, how far up here is your car?” I shift around, trying to make
conversation.
“I think a mile or so. Do you mind if we stop at it real quick? I need to
grab my bags.” He huffs out a laugh that contains zero humor. “I really
thought I was going to be able to walk to a service station or something and
get this taken care of tonight, but that's clearly not going to happen.”
It really wasn't.
I didn't lie when I told him we're practically in a dead zone for cell
service.
I've driven through these parts enough times in the last three years to
know that. I just came from spending the weekend at my mom's to
celebrate my sister's engagement to her lawyer fiancé.
Something my mom made sure to bring up every second of the trip.
“I just don't understand why you don't settle down, Harper.”
“You should find a successful man like your sister, Harper.”
“You're scaring off suitors with all those creepy things you make,
Harper.”
She means well. I know she does.
But when you watch your parents love each other for sixteen years and
then discover that the reason your father died suddenly in a car crash was
because he was on his way to visit his mistress…
Well, it kind of screws with you and puts you off relationships.
“Are you from around here?” Collin's deep rumble pulls me from my
thoughts.
“Sort of. I'm from Howardsville, but I've lived in Bartlett since I
graduated college.”
“What's with all the villes in this area? I swear every city ends in ville.”
I laugh. “I thought I was the only person who ever noticed that. It drives
me nuts. It's confusing.” I glance at him. “Are you from here?”
He takes his time answering but finally says, “No. I'm from Kansas.”
“Really? What are you doing all the way out here?”
“Work.” He doesn't elaborate, just points up the road. “My car is just
over this hill.”
A wave of relief flows through me when we reach the top and it's sitting
on the side of the road.
At least he wasn't lying about being stranded. That makes me feel
marginally better about letting a strange man into my car.
I wasn't lying when I said he doesn't seem like the dangerous type.
Maybe that's just me being hopeful and naive, but I'm generally good at
reading people.
I pull to a stop behind his SUV. It's not as nice as I expected it to be.
He's only wearing a pair of jeans and a t-shirt, but even I have enough
fashion sense to see that neither item cost less than a hundred dollars.
Which is insane. I think my entire outfit cost me ten. I love a good
clearance rack.
“I'll be right back,” he says quietly, but he doesn't make any move to
exit the car.
I glance over to find him staring at me expectantly, like he's waiting for
confirmation that I'm not going to leave him on the side of the road or
something.
“I'll be here,” I say reassuringly, trying to pretend I don't love the way
the dome light casts shadows across his face. I kill the engine to prove to
him I'm not going to leave.
He gives me a single nod, then pushes the door open. He jogs to the
vehicle and opens the back door. There's not much, a few bags.
One of them is massive and looks like it weighs nearly half of me, but
he slings it over his shoulder with zero apparent effort.
He grabs the other two, then pushes the back door closed with his
elbow.
I pop my trunk and climb out of the car to meet him.
He's staring down at the Carolina Comets sticker on the bumper, and I
wonder if I offended him by not being a fan of hockey. It's not like I'm antisports or anything, they just don't exactly get my nipples hard.
I pause just as I'm about to lift the trunk, remembering what I have in
there. I pin him with a glare that I hope is fierce. “Do not judge me for the
contents of my trunk.”
“As long as it's not a body, I think we're good.”
When I wince—because it's not a body per se—he arches a dark brow
but doesn't say anything.
Huh. Awfully trusting.
I lift the trunk and hold my breath, waiting for his reaction.
He laughs, and it's a deep, throaty sound that I'm going to pretend I
don't find attractive.
“Hey! I said not to judge me.”
“I didn't promise not to.” He slides his eyes toward my trunk. “You
going to move these creepy-as-fuck things or what?”
“They are not creepy!” I reach into the trunk to grab a box of dolls to
move to the backseat. “Well, fine. They are kind of creepy. But that's the
point of them.”
“Please tell me you don't collect these.”
“For personal use? No. But I do use them to make decor.”
“You…make stuff with these?”
I nod as I pull open the back passenger door. “I have a store online that
specializes in these. I make and sell other stuff too, but these always make a
big profit, usually because I can pick them up so cheap.”
I shove the box across the backseat to my side.
“What do you make out of them?” he asks when I reemerge to grab the
other box.
“All kinds of stuff. Pretty much anything creepy. I'll usually paint them
to look dead or like zombies. Sometimes I'll use them as a base to make
baby versions of popular horror icons, like Michael or Jason or Freddy.”
“That is…” I wait for him to make the same face a lot of people do.
“Well, it's pretty fucking awesome.”
“Yeah?”
“Hell yeah. I love old-school horror films like that. They don't make
them like they used to, that's for sure.”
“Right? They aren't even scary anymore, just rely on jump scares you
can see coming from a mile away.”
I grunt when I grab the second box so he can drop his stuff into the
trunk. It's much heavier than the first, and I can already feel sweat
beginning to form on the back of my neck. I'm sure I look real attractive
right now.
“Totally not scary.” He sets his three bags in the trunk, then grabs the
box of doll parts from my hands. I want to protest, but something tells me
he wouldn't let me carry it anyway. “Did you see the one with the ghost
hunters?”
“The ones who turned out to be dead the whole time?”
“Yeah.”
He rolls his eyes, then disappears into the backseat momentarily. When
he reappears, he places his arms on the hood of the car and runs his hand
over the stubble that's lining his sharp jaw. Shit, when did that move
become hot?
“What about the one with the family who moved into the farmhouse and
they ended up being stalked by the farmhand who showed up literally every
time something creepy happened and they never put two and two together?”
“That one had me raging at the screen. Like, come on! First, why do
you move into a house where a double murder happened and then act all
surprised when spooky stuff starts taking place? Second, he was literally
there every time! It was obviously him!”
He chuckles. “So awful.”
We grow quiet, the faint sounds of insects beginning to come to life in
the nearby forest.
Even though we're not speaking, I don't feel like I need to fill the
silence. It's weird how easy it is to talk to him, but I'm also thankful
because we have a solid four hours ahead of us.
“So, uh, is that everything you need from your car?”
He nods instead of answering, then reaches his hand across the hood.
“What?”
“Keys.”
“What? No way.”
“Yes way,” he says as he pushes off the car and comes around to my
side. He doesn't stop until he's right in front of me, and I have to tip my
head back to look at his face. “I saw the way you were squinting just
driving to my car. You're blind as fuck. You almost hit me when there was
still light outside. We're about half an hour from there being none at all, and
I'd really like to get to where I'm going in one piece.”
I grit my teeth because he's not wrong.
I am blind as fuck at night. It's why I was so annoyed when my mom
insisted we go for lunch with my sister this afternoon. It ran long just like I
knew it would and put me a good two hours behind when I wanted to leave
to avoid driving at night.
“You can trust me, Harper.”
I stare up at him, and my mouth goes dry.
Can I trust him?
I don't know why I'm hesitating all of a sudden, why just now my
nerves are on edge.
Maybe it's the reality that I'm about to drive multiple hours with
someone I don't know sitting beside me. Someone insanely attractive on top
of it.
Or maybe it's that handing him my keys is like handing over my life to
him.
I drop them into his outstretched hand. “If you wreck my car, I swear,
I'll—”
“Shoot me with your gun?”
“Yes!”
That part I didn't lie about. I do have a gun.
“Right,” he says, not looking the least bit threatened. “Duly noted. Let's
get on the road, then.”
I march over to the passenger side and climb into my car. It feels weird
being on this side of the vehicle, and not just because I have to pull the seat
way up.
The car isn't much to most people, but it's mine and it's completely paid
for, which is a big bonus in my eyes. I wanted something reliable, and this
has proved to be just that.
Granted, I didn't think it was that small when I bought it, but I know it
just feels that way now because of Collin taking up most of the room.
I watch the way his muscles jump as he navigates us back onto the road.
He looks calm and collected—and a lot more confident driving than I did as
night falls around us.
Several miles pass before either of us speaks.
“Do you do it full-time?”
My brows pinch together at his question, and he peeks over at me when
I don't answer right away.
“The dolls,” he clarifies. “Is that what you do full-time?”
I nod. “It is. I went to school for art and found I had a knack for creating
props and such.”
“Wouldn't that be a job more suited for California? Hollywood and
such?”
“Ever heard of the internet?” I cringe at the sarcasm that drips from my
words. “Sorry. I'm not exactly good with people, and sometimes my words
come out a little harsher than I intend.”
“I mean, my first impression of you was you trying to run me over.
Little hard to top that at this point.”
Another cringe. “Sorry.”
He laughs. “All good. You're more than making up for it by giving me a
ride. My co—boss would probably have my ass for getting in a car with
someone I don't know, but I bet he'd be even more pissed if I was roadkill.”
“I doubt you would have died. I wasn't even going that fast.”
He gives me a look that clearly says I'm full of shit before returning his
gaze to the road.
“Fine.” I huff. “So you'd maybe be a little dead. I'm really glad I didn't
kill you though. That would have looked so bad for my business.”
“Yes, your business being in jeopardy was my biggest concern too.”
A smile tugs at his lips.
Maybe my surprise road trip buddy won't be so bad after all.

COLLIN
“You take that back right now, mister!”
I shake my head. “No way. I'm right and you know it.”
“You are wrong. So unbelievably wrong. Michael is a million times
better than Freddy.”
“Is he, though? Freddy is hilarious and scary—that perfect
combination.”
“Is he, though?” she tosses back. “Michael is menacing. He's just
always…there. Watching and waiting.” She lets out a shiver. “It's creepy.”
“It's predictable. Stalk, stab, chase, repeat.” I roll my eyes. “Freddy is
the complete opposite. You never know what the hell the dude is going to
do next.”
“Except call you a bitch. He always calls his victims a bitch. I'm coming
for you, bitch,” she mocks in a deep voice. “Oh god, those movies are so
cheesy.”
“Absolutely awful. But somehow still addicting and good? Except for
that reboot. That was terrible.”
“Oddly enough, I thought it was too dark.”
“Agreed. They tried taking it way too seriously.”
“What about Freddy vs. Jason?”
“Absolute classic. A masterpiece.”
“Kia, he has asthma!” she quotes, and we fall into laughter again.
A loud rumble echoes over our sounds.
Now it's just Harper who is laughing as I cringe.
“Was that your stomach?” I nod. “Hungry?”
“Fucking starved. I usually have a pretty set schedule for meals, and I'm
about four hours past that right now.”
“You could have said something or just taken us through a drive-thru.”
I could have, but it didn't feel right whipping into a fast-food joint.
She's already doing me a favor by giving me a ride. I don't want to add
more time to her journey.
“Pull off at the next exit,” she instructs, pointing at the sign as we pass
it. “I could go for something to eat myself. You don't mind eating while
driving, do you?”
“I think I can manage.”
We've been on the road for an hour now, but we've only made it
another thirty miles after hitting a long stretch of construction where we had
to sit in traffic for half an hour. Thanks to that, we're somehow still at least
a few hours away from our destination.
I stifle a yawn, already knowing I'm going to be bone-tired for practice
tomorrow.
I hit the next exit and we slowly make our way through the town,
looking for something to eat. It's fairly barren with only one drive-thru
open.
“Well, guess that eliminates the whole ‘where do you want to eat'
conversation that always ends in an argument,” she says as I pull into the
short line.
“If you weren't going to pick a place, I'd have just gone wherever I
wanted to eat and you'd either find something or you wouldn't.”
Her brows shoot up in a way that says Seriously?
I shrug. “I don't play around when it comes to food.”
“Noted.”
I place our order: two cheeseburgers and chicken nuggets for me and a
burger with fries for her.
“Here.” I look over to find Harper holding her debit card my way.
I return her lifted-brow stare from earlier. “Not happening.”
She shoves it my way again, and I shake my head. She gives up with a
groan, slipping it back into her wallet before tucking it into her purse.
“You're kind of annoying.”
I chuckle. “I'll take into serious consideration from now on that the girl
who tried to run me over finds me annoying.”
She crosses her arms with a huff. “Are you going to hold that against
me forever?”
“Oh, I'm sorry, am I supposed to forget about it already?”
“It's been over an hour.”
“Right.” I smack my forehead. “I forgot that all traumatic events only
have an hour-long window for when I'm allowed to be salty about them.”
“Wow. So you're not just annoying, you're also dramatic.”
“I thought I was only kind of annoying.”
“You've leveled up. Congratulations.”
But there's a smile on her face when she says it.
Even under the harsh yellow lights of the drive-thru, she's still cute with
her arms crossed and eyes narrowed, lips pinched tightly together.
She told me the reason she's driving from Howardsville to Bartlett is
because her older sister is getting married and she had to go home for an
engagement party. I've never understood the point of those, but she seemed
excited about it, so I didn't say anything to crush her spirit.
When she asked me what I do, I quickly shifted the conversation back
to her. She lit up like the sky on a July night and animatedly began talking
about her love of all things horror. We started comparing our favorites, and
the conversation has flowed naturally…and away from me. Just how I like
it.
Talking with her has been so easy that I haven't once thought about
losing the Cup. Or the fact that my teammates probably hate me and I have
to face them tomorrow.
I wince. Never mind. There it is.
Harper busies herself with her phone, and it takes a lot for me to not
peek at the screen to see what she's doing.
It's a dick move, but I want to know if she's recognized me yet, if she's
plugging my name into Google just to see all the shitty things I've done
lately.
We pull up to the window to pay, and the moment the kid behind the
register sees me, recognition dawns on his face. His eyes go wide and his
mouth drops open.
Please don't say anything. Please don't say anything.
“Shit,” the kid mumbles. “You… You're Col—”
“One sweet tea and one unsweet,” I interrupt, turning my body to block
his reaction from Harper's view. I don't want this to turn into a big deal and
have her asking too many questions. While she still hasn't indicated she has
a clue who I am, I don't want to risk a scene. “Kind of in a hurry.”
“Right. Of course. Totally get it. But do you mind…” The kid, who
doesn't seem old enough to be out of high school, holds a pen my way.
“Sure. No problem.” I grab it and scribble my name on the blank receipt
paper he hands over to me.
“Thanks, man. I'm a big fan.”
“Love to hear it.” I shoot him a grin. “Can I get those drinks?”
“Oh, shit. Right. Be right back.”
The kid scurries off, and I relax back into the seat.
I'm used to getting noticed, but a lot of times the people around town let
me be. Sure, they'll gawk at me and sometimes ask for an autograph, but I
think with seeing me every day and realizing I'm just a normal person, the
fame has kind of worn off for them. Something I'm undoubtedly grateful
for.
Some players enter the NHL with dreams of fame and fortune and
having their faces splashed everywhere. And some enter because they're
married to the game and all they're jonesing for is their next shift on the ice.
I fall into the latter category.
Fortune? Well, you don't see me bitching about being paid to play the
game I love.
Fame? I'd rather take a puck to the gut from Zdeno Chara than be
forced into the limelight.
It's why I've always kept a low profile. My private life is just that—
private. I don't do big parties and I don't get caught with my pants down. I
keep my head down and I play the game. I don't do relationships and I
don't really let people into my circle.
Until recently, I've kind of been known for being tightlipped about
things. Now that all my history has been broadcast for the world to see, I'm
having a harder time keeping to myself.
The kid returns to the window with our drinks and food, and I try to
hand him my card again but he shakes his head.
“No way. It's on me.”
Normally I'd argue, but right now I just want to get my food and go
before more people start to recognize me. I can already see a few
employees in the background trying to take sneaky looks.
“Thanks. Appreciate it.”
I grab the food and give the kid another wave before hitting the gas just
a little too hard in an effort to get out of there quickly.
“What was that all about?” Harper asks, taking the bag from my lap.
“You took off like a bat out of hell.”
“Just not used to the car, is all,” I explain.
“Fair enough. Since we've stopped, we should probably pop over to that
gas station too. Top off the tank just in case we hit any more of that
construction traffic.”
Shit. Probably not a bad idea.
I pull into the gas station right across the street.
“Can you pump? I better go pee before we get back on the road.”
“Sure.”
She shoves that damn debit card at me again. “Here. Use this.”
“Harper…” I groan.
“Just shut up and use it, dammit. You don't know me very well, Collin,
but I'm stubborn as shit. So you'd better use it or I swear I'll make a
scene.”
There's a glint in her eye that tells me she isn't lying.
“Fine,” I tell her, though I have no intentions of actually using her card.
“Hurry up though. No dawdling or I'm sending Freddy in after you.”
“Oooh, I'm shaking in my boots at the thought.” She lifts her eyes
skyward, then darts from the car, dashing into the small gas station.
I slide my card into the pump—she'll never even know the difference—
and stick the nozzle into the car, then lean against it, hoping she doesn't
take too long inside.
A car pulls up at the pump next to me, and I pull my hat down low.
It's pointless though. As soon as the driver steps out, I see the familiar
look of shock.
I give the guy a tight smile and look anywhere but at him. He takes the
hint as he slides his card into the pump, then starts filling up his tank.
Except with my luck, it doesn't stick.
“You're Collin Wright, yeah?” He gives me a sad smile I'm beginning
to recognize from fans. “Tough loss in Game Six, man.”
You're fucking telling me.
“Yeah, wasn't my best night.”
“That guy totally dove though. I can't believe they called you on that
penalty. Such bullshit, bro.”
It was bullshit. The biggest sack of it I've ever seen too.
Everyone who watched the tape back knew he dove. They knew I didn't
do shit. But it doesn't matter. I had my stick there in a prone position and he
took the opportunity.
I created the chance and let him take it.
I cost us the game.
“And those arrests? Man, that one…you were a minor. Shit doesn't
count. And everyone knows what happened at the bar was a joke.” He
scoffs, shaking his head. “But don't sweat it, dude. I'm sure everyone has
already forgotten about it. You're gonna kick ass this season. I can feel it.”
Has everyone forgotten though? I've kept off social media for the
summer, but that doesn't mean I haven't heard the rumors.
There have been countless articles wondering how I'm going to screw
up and get arrested again. They already have a name coined—the Hothead
Hat Trick—just waiting for the other shoe to drop.
“What'd you say your name was?”
“Max.”
“Thanks, Max,” I say, sticking my hand out to him.
He beams down at it with shock, then finally latches on, giving me an
excited shake.
“The team is grateful for fans like you,” I tell him. “We're gonna need
your support this season.”
“I ain't no fair-weather fan. We've gone this long without a Cup. I'm
not turning my back on my team now.”
Even though they're pissed at me, I'm not turning my back on them
either.
My pump clicks and I tap the nozzle against the gas tank a few times. I
replace it, then screw on the cap as the bell chimes.
“Oh my god, Collin!” I glance up to see Harper looking at me with big,
excited eyes. “They have pickled sausages! Can you believe it? I'm
grabbing some!”
She scurries back into the gas station with a new pep in her step.
I watch as she races through the aisles, then deposits two arms full of
candy and snacks on the counter.
She looks…cute.
Man, I gotta stop calling her that.
But there's really no other way to describe her.
I know you shouldn't judge people based on how they look, but the fact
that the girl wearing a pair of cutoff shorts, a t-shirt covered in pink flowers,
and glitter Converse makes horror props? Yeah, fucking color me surprised
by that.
Even though I don't really know her, I think it sort of fits. She seems to
march to the beat of her own drum, and I like that.
“Hey, uh, Collin?” I turn back to the guy at the pump who is now
holding a pen and a piece of paper. “Mind if I get an autograph?”
I paste on my fan smile. “I'll do you one better.”
I pop the trunk of Harper's Honda and feel around my hockey bag for a
puck. When I finally pluck one free, I scrawl my name across it, then hand
it over to the guy.
“Here you go. As I said, the team needs more fans like you.”
He stares down at it with amazement. “Holy…damn, man. Thank you.
Think I could get another one? My…buddy is a big fan too.”
There's something in the way he says it that reminds me of the way my
brother introduces his boyfriend to people he's not so sure are willing to
accept his sexuality.
I take a chance and grab one of the few Pride Night pucks I have tucked
into my bag, sign it, and hand it over.
His eyes widen as he looks from the puck to me and back again.
“I brought those for my brother to give out at the safe house. Had a few
extras left over.”
He swallows, nodding. “I appreciate it.”
“And we appreciate you, Max.”
“Hey, you—oh. Sorry.”
I spin around to find Harper holding two bags, which I can see are
stuffed with all kinds of things, including…is that a blanket?
I slam the trunk closed, not wanting her to see my hockey gear that I
brought with me in case I wanted to train, and turn back to Max.
“Thanks again,” he says, giving me a big smile.
“Sure thing. Any time.”
I turn back to Harper. “You ready?”
She nods, eyeing Max curiously as she makes her way to the passenger
door.
I wait for her to get into the car before I blow out a heavy breath.
Maybe I should just tell her who I am. Let her make her own decisions
about me. Maybe she won't give a shit about my status.
Or maybe she will, like everyone else does.
Maybe she'll use it against me or for her own gain like so many others
have.
I don't know…it's kind of nice just being Collin Wright, an everyday
guy, instead of Collin Wright, an NHL player with an impressive stats sheet
and arrest record.
I wince, not wanting to think about that now.
When I finally climb back into the driver's seat, Harper's busy digging
through her bags.
“Did you buy the whole store?”
She peeks up at me with guilty eyes. “Maybe? Did I mention gas
stations are kind of my weakness? I always end up spending my emergency
cash in them. I can't help myself.”
“You didn't mention that, or else I wouldn't have let you run wild in
there.”
“I can't help it!” She laughs. “They always have the coolest stuff.” She
pulls a blanket from the bag, then wraps it around her shoulders, snuggling
it close. “Plus, gas station blankets are the best.”
I shake my head, grinning as I turn over the engine. “I'll take your word
for it.”
“You should. What did that guy want?”
“Huh?” I play dumb. “Oh, he, uh, needed some cash for gas.” My
stomach turns at the lie. “Did I hear you say something about pickled
sausages?”
“Oh!” She dives back into the bag, searching around for her emergency
pickled sausage.
Bullet dodged.

HARPER
Collin is…strange.
He doesn't scare me or worry me, and I actually feel very safe in the car
with him.
But it hasn't escaped my notice that he's definitely hiding something.
I just can't put my finger on what it is.
The cashier at the gas station kept peeking over at him like he was
somebody he knew. Then the guy at the gas pump kept staring at him in
wonder.
At first, I figured it was nothing, like maybe he just has one of those
familiar faces. But the way he keeps avoiding answering any personal
questions has me suspecting otherwise.
Either way, it's really none of my business. As long as we get to our
destination and he doesn't murder me, I'm calling it a win.
Besides, it's not like I'll ever see the guy again after tonight.
“Dip me,” he says, holding up a chicken nugget.
We've been back on the road for an hour now, and I have no idea how
he's still hungry after blazing through two cheeseburgers, half of my fries,
and a pickled sausage that did not go over well with him.
“How the hell are you still eating?”
“I'm a growing boy,” he answers me. “And besides, I need to get the
taste of pickled sausage out of my mouth.” He grimaces. “Now dip me,
woman.”
I roll my eyes and hold up a cup of ketchup. He dunks his nugget in it,
the same thing we've been doing for the last ten minutes, and pops it into
his mouth in one bite. He demands a dip, and I provide it.
“I find it completely disgusting that you're eating chicken nuggets with
ketchup when there are so many other amazing sauces to be dipping them
in.”
He swallows his bite, and it's kind of ridiculous of me to be impressed
that a guy is swallowing his food before talking. “Ketchup is the king of
condiments. It's the first one we all try as children. If you think just because
I'm an almost-thirty-year-old man I am not going to still have a love affair
with ketchup, you're dead wrong.”
So he's almost thirty, huh.
“I'm twenty-seven, by the way,” he says like he can hear my thoughts.
Then he grabs another chicken nugget. “Dip me.”
Our arms brush as he returns his hands to the steering wheel, and I try to
ignore it just like I've been trying to ignore it this whole time.
“Twenty-four,” I answer his unasked question.
“Huh. A twenty-four-year-old successful woman who runs her own
business. Nice.”
He pops his nugget into his mouth.
“A twenty-seven-year-old from Kansas who now works in North
Carolina at some mysterious corporation.”
I see the muscles in his jaw jump.
Yeah, so I'm digging for information—big deal. The dude is a steel trap,
and I'm curious.
“Sports industry,” he says after several quiet beats.
That's the big secret? Sports?
When I don't say anything, he peeks over at me.
“I work in the sports industry.”
“Are you mad because I said I don't like sports? Because I was just
joking about you talking my ear off about them. I really don't care if sports
are your thing. They just aren't mine.”
“So you don't watch any sports? Not even with your boyfriend?”
I laugh at his completely obvious way of asking if I have a boyfriend.
“No boyfriend. I am very single. Thank you for the reminder. Though you
could have just outright asked me.”
“Good.”
I lift my brow. “Good that I don't have a boyfriend?”
Is he…interested?
“Yeah. Don't want to get you in trouble or anything.”
Oh.
“If I had a boyfriend who got pissed about me helping a stranger, I
wouldn't want him to be my boyfriend anymore.”
“To be fair, I'd be pissed as hell if my girlfriend was dumb enough to let
some random weirdo into her car.”
“Dumb, huh?”
“Completely.”
He doesn't look the least bit sorry for saying it, and I don't entirely
blame him. It was dumb. So stupid.
But Collin doesn't scare me.
My gut is telling me I can trust him, and my gut has never been wrong
before.
“Well, your girlfriend doesn't have to worry about me hitting on you.”
“No, she just has to worry about you trying to hit me.” I groan, and he
chuckles. “And you could have just outright asked me, you know.” He
smirks, feeling proud of throwing my words back at me. “I don't have a
girlfriend.”
“Good.”
“Good?” he echoes.
“Yeah. Wouldn't want you to get in trouble.”
Another smirk.
I ignore the way it makes my heart race a little faster.
“To answer your question, no, I don't watch any sports. I couldn't tell
you a thing about them. I used to watch some with my dad, but I only did
that to spend time with him.” I swallow thickly, not wanting to get into the
sad tale of how I used to watch games with my father, but now that he's
dead, it doesn't feel the same. He'll give me that pitying look everyone
does, and I really don't want that from him. “It didn't stick though. I gave it
up.”
“What does he like to watch?”
“Football.” His head bobs at my answer. “But don't go getting ideas
about talking sports all of a sudden. I've already warned you about my
penchant to fall asleep when they're discussed.”
He grins. “Fine. But can I just say that experiencing live games is so
different from watching it on your television?”
“I'll keep that in mind.”
He looks like he wants to say something but thinks better of it.
Instead, he holds up another chicken nugget. “You gonna dip me or
what?”
“Has anyone ever told you you're needy?”
“Woman…” he growls, and I laugh, giving him his precious ketchup.
When I open my eyes, we're on the bridge leading into the downtown area.
I'm not sure when it happened, but at some point during the drive, I
must have rested my head against the window and passed out.
I shift in my seat, my back screaming at me for sitting in the same
position for so long. My new blanket is wrapped around me, though I don't
remember doing that myself.
Oh hell.
How stupid can I be for falling asleep? Anything could have happened
to me. He could have driven me to his secret lair and kidnapped me forever.
Or worse.
I am such an idiot.
“Hey,” Collin says softly. “You're up.”
I brush my hair out of my eyes, wipe at the drool that's dried on my
face, and then peek over at him.
“You fell asleep,” he explains.
“Gee, thanks for that astute observation.”
His eyes narrow. “Someone's cranky when they wake up. And for the
record, I don't have a lair.”
Oh shit. I must have been talking out loud. “I'm only cranky when I
wake up next to strangers who have kidnapped me in the middle of the
night.”
“Well, if you hadn't fallen asleep, you'd know there was a bad accident
and we got rerouted. It's just after midnight.”
“It added that much time to the trip?”
“That traffic was a bitch.” He scrubs a hand over his jaw as he yawns.
“My fucking back is killing me after all that.”
“Wait—I thought you were going to Jonesville?”
He winces, peeking over at me. “I lied. I didn't want you to know where
I was really going until I knew you weren't some psycho.”
“Oh my god. Almost hit a guy with your car one time and suddenly
you're some psycho.”
I'm not mad. Not really. It was honestly probably a smart move and
what I should have done.
I'm going to chalk all my bad decisions up to being in shock over
almost ending someone's life.
“I figured I'd let you sleep so you can be rested to get to where you're
going. I don't know how long your drive is, but I'm just a few blocks up
here.”
Does he live downtown?
That's…not cheap. At all.
He must make a killing doing whatever it is he does. His car wasn't
anything flashy, but maybe it's a sentimental thing?
I shake my head. Whatever. I shouldn't be judging him right now.
Collin drives a few more blocks before expertly parallel-parking the car
right in front of a building where the rent is easily twice what mine is.
He shuts the engine off, and uncomfortable silence falls over us.
It's the first time since we've been in the same car that I've felt this
way. This sense of…uncertainty. The ride with him has been surprisingly
easy. Natural.
But this moment?
It feels like climbing a hill with no end in sight.
After what feels like hours, Collin clears his throat, the loud sound
nearly making me jump.
“Well, this is me,” he says lamely.
“Right.”
I push the door open, and he follows suit.
We meet at the back of the car, and I watch in silence as he pulls his
bags from the trunk.
I don't know what to say to him. You're welcome? Should I apologize
again?
Am I supposed to give him my number? Or ask for his?
No. That's stupid. This was just one of those once-in-a-lifetime things
you keep in your back pocket for a good story at a bonfire.
Loaded down with his bags, he's standing close, and even though I've
been sitting next to him for hours now, this somehow feels different.
There's a thread between us, and I can't help it when I step closer to
him, as if I'm being pulled.
The streetlights illuminate him with the harshest shadows yet somehow
he still looks good.
His hat is flipped backward again, and those eyes of his—a color I still
can't discern—are peering down at me with hesitancy. His tongue pokes out
to lick at his bottom lip.
My eyes track the movement, breath catching.
And I hold it, waiting.
Waiting.
Wanting.
I…I think I want him to kiss me.
He leans closer, and I push onto my tiptoes, ready. Eager.
A loud wail comes from just up the street, and we jump away like we've
been caught doing something we shouldn't.
An ambulance screams down the road and the moment is broken.
“Uh, listen, Harper, I—”
I wave my hand, taking a step back. “Let's not suddenly make this
awkward, okay?”
He laughs. “Fair enough.” He sticks his hand out to me. “Thanks for not
killing me.”
I clasp his hand and try to ignore the warmth spreading through me.
“Thank you for not kidnapping me.”
“I would gladly not kidnap you any time.”
I roll my eyes at his stupid joke and pull my hand away, tucking it into
my pocket as that awkward silence returns.
“Well…” I say, rocking back on my heels. “I better get going before it
gets any later.”
“Right.” He nods, then steps back, a ghost of a smile on his lips. “Night,
Harper.”
“Goodbye, Collin.”
I don't look back at him as I climb into my car and pull back onto the
street.
But somehow, I know he's watching me even as my taillights disappear
from view.

COLLIN
“For fuck's sake, Wright. Have you never skated before? You look like a
newborn cow looking for a tit out there. Move it or I'll move you.”
I don't think Coach Heller—or Coach Hell as we like to call him—has
any idea what a baby cow looks like. He's been a city dweller his whole
life. Farm life would kill him.
I don't respond. I just push harder. I know I'm skating like ass, but I'm
tired as hell.
I waited until Harper's taillights disappeared before I walked the four
blocks back to my apartment. No way was I going to take her to my actual
building.
When I finally dragged my ass up to the twentieth floor, I was fucking
done for. I kicked off my shoes and face-planted onto my bed. I didn't move
until my alarm went off at 6 AM.
Even though I didn't move, I dreamed.
And, man, were my dreams filled with Harper.
The longer we sat in that car together, the more I liked her. She was
funny, smart, and almost painfully honest, not to mention she was insanely
attractive. She doesn't have that in-your-face kind of beauty. It's the subtle
kind that sneaks up on you, and damn did it sneak up on me. Every time
she'd shift around in the seat and those shorts of hers would ride up higher,
I'd have to talk my dick down from reacting.
I wanted to ask for her number as I stood there with my bags. Wanted to
ask if I could see her again. And I really fucking wanted to kiss her.
But I was too chicken to do any of it.
Instead, I let her walk away without even knowing her last name.
And this morning I palmed my cock as I thought of her. After I came, I
felt like a dick. The first thing I should have done was worry about if she
got home okay, not jerk to thoughts of her. For all I know, she lied about her
final destination too and had an even longer drive ahead of her.
I'm such an ass.
My defense partner skates up next to me as we run drills. “Better wipe
that faraway look off your face before Coach sees it.”
We've been back on the ice for all of half an hour and Rhodes and I are
already falling into sync with each other. It's why no matter how badly I'm
skating today, Coach's threat to move me is just that—a threat.
But to move me somewhere else…a new team…
I shake my head, not wanting to think about that.
Miller, a young rookie, slides up next to us. “Has Coach ever even been
on a farm before?”
A right-winger who joined the team two years ago, he's one hell of a
player with a promising career ahead of him. Everyone out on this ice right
now knows he's the reason we made it as far as we did last year—thanks to
that overtime goal of his—but not everyone likes it. A few of the more
veteran players were not happy about him earning a first-line spot.
I chuckle. “Those were my thoughts exactly.”
“Hey, you idiots better not let Heller hear you talking shit about him.
He'll go full Goon and wipe the ice with you.” Lowell, our team captain,
speaks low enough so the man in question doesn't hear as he skates closer
to us. “Get those legs moving, boys.”
Out of all the guys on the team, these three are the ones I'm closest with
since we spend the most time on the ice together. Plus, they don't hate me
for what happened last year, which is always a bonus.
“Beers tonight?” Rhodes asks after Lowell and Miller skate away.
“Of course,” I tell him, not forgetting our first-practice tradition.
Ice time lasts a little longer than usual and then we're off to team
meetings for another two hours. Somehow, those meetings are almost as
exhausting as running drills.
We go over conduct rules and nutrition and all your basic bullshit we
should all already know by now. By the time we're done for the day, I'm
wiped and very much looking forward to that beer.
“Wright!” Coach hollers at me just as I'm about to head out.
I've been with the Comets long enough to know that means he wants to
see me in his office.
I shoulder my bag and head in there, hoping whatever this is won't take
too long. I need food and a fucking nap.
“Shut the door, kid,” he instructs when I walk over the threshold.
I do as he says and take a seat in the chair across from him.
Coach is an older man on the shorter side. His belly is rounded—
probably from all the baked goods his wife whips up—and he's missing a
big patch of hair from the back of his head.
But don't let his small stature and soft features fool you—the man is a
beast on the ice.
He's a Stanley Cup champion and a hell of a scrapper. He can play with
the biggest and best of them and holds his own just fine.
“Good summer?” he asks, folding his hands over his stomach.
“Mostly uneventful, thank fuck.”
Aside from all the small inconvenient things that happened, I managed
to come out without another arrest and my name stayed out of the headlines
for a few weeks.
That's a win for me.
“Heard your car broke down yesterday and you were stranded. Get that
taken care of?”
How the hell does he find these things out so quickly?
“Working on it, Coach.”
“Good.” He nods, eyeing me with the dark brown gaze I swear sees
everything. “You good, kid?”
I know what he's asking.
He's wondering if I'm ready for this season. If I've put all the shit from
last year behind me. If we're going to have a problem again. If I'm willing
to do whatever it takes to make sure we get back in the Finals and we win
the Cup. If I'm going to flop during a contract year and make my chances
of the Comets offering me a new deal even slimmer.
I need this to be a good year for me, especially after the shitshow from
last season.
He knows it as well as I do.
“I'm good, Coach.”
The words sound strong and steady.
But I'm honestly not fucking good.
I skated like ass this morning. Even though Rhodes and I were good,
gelling like we always do, I was off with most of the team.
Some of the guys are definitely still pissed at me for taking that penalty
that cost us the game. I think deep down they know it was a shit call, but
they're still determined to blame someone for the loss.
That someone just happens to be me.
Coach nods, seeming to buy my response. “All right, kid. Glad to hear.”
He drops his head, focusing his stare on the stack of paperwork in front
of him. I stand, taking the hint that I'm dismissed.
“Wright?” Coach calls just as I'm about to walk out the door.
I peer back at him, his attention still on his desk. “Hmm?”
“Maybe keep the distractions to a minimum this season, yeah?”
I nod, even though he's not looking at me. “Understood, Coach.”
What he's saying comes through loud and clear: Keep your head down.
Focus on the game.
And that's just what I plan to do.
“Did you hear Colter got a chick pregnant over the break?”
“Wait…another one?”
Rhodes bobs his head. “Yeah, man. That's two bunnies in the last year,
plus the chick from a couple years ago. It was all over the papers.”
I wouldn't know. I've been avoiding them.
Hell, I've been avoiding anything that gets me even remotely in trouble.
Tonight is the first time I've been in a bar in months, and I'm making
sure to keep my eyes peeled for any potential issues.
I only agreed to come because I've been gone all summer and—not that
I'd admit it to him—I kind of missed Rhodes.
“Kid needs to learn to wrap his shit up or keep it in his pants.”
“That's what I said!” Rhodes throws his arms up, beer sloshing around
in his bottle. He draws the attention of a few women sitting down at the
other end of the bar, and I see the spark in their eyes when they realize who
we are. “Did he not learn his lesson the first time?”
“Or second, apparently.”
“I guess that's one way to get a hat trick.” Rhodes winks, and I shake
my head at his lame joke. “Guess that means you're off the hook though.
The media is blasting the chick's story everywhere. She's talking to anyone
who will listen, selling all kinds of information on him.”
“This is why I don't fuck around with women.” I take a pull from my
beer. “They'll ruin your career.”
He shrugs, picking at the label of his. “Not all of them are so bad.”
“Please tell me you aren't still hooking up with Brittney.”
When he doesn't say anything, I know he is.
“Dude!” I glare at him. “We talked about this. Fucking gabbed for hours
like girls at that away game.” I shake my head. “You need to break it off
with her. She doesn't give a shit about you. She's using you.”
“Hey, man, when the heart wants what it wants…”
I give him a disappointed frown, and he just shrugs.
I think she's a money-hungry bitch looking to ride his coattails, but
Rhodes doesn't see her that way.
He fell for her fast. I think he told me he was going to marry her on the
second date, but Brittney wasn't on the same page. She wanted something
casual. No attachments…except her hand to his wallet.
They've been doing the friends-with-benefits thing for two years now,
and by that I mean Rhodes sits around waiting for her to realize she's in
love with him while she continues to date every idiot out there, only to run
back to him when she gets her heart broken.
For some reason I cannot comprehend, he's willing to wait for her.
A few guys on the team give him shit for it, claiming she must have
some magical pussy or something, but I think the poor bastard is just
seriously in love with her.
“I don't want to hear shit from you. At least I'm getting laid frequently.”
“Yeah, you and all the other guys she's screwing.”
“We're not…that's not what we have. I can see other women if I want
to,” he argues, but I can see the disappointment in his eyes.
“And I'll have you know, I'm doing just fine in the getting-laid
department, thank you very much.”
“Really? Because you were skating like trash this morning. Trash
skating means you're not relaxed. If you were getting laid, you'd be
relaxed.”
“Is that how that works out?”
“Yep.”
All right, fine.
He's not wrong.
I haven't been laid in a long time, and I am far from relaxed lately. Not
even jerking off this morning could help fix it.
But can I really be blamed? I'm stressed about getting back in the swing
of things with the team. About the season. About making sure I'm toeing
the line and not fucking up like I did last year. About earning a spot so I can
stay with this team I love so much.
He claps me on the back. “I know that face. It's the face of a sexdeprived man.”
I shrug off his hand with a scowl. “I am not sex-deprived. I'm just…
focused on my game.”
At the mention of sex, Harper's face pops into my head.
I remember the way she looked at me, how her eyes slowly raked over
my body. How she kept staring at me when she thought I was focused on
the road. The way she looked up at me as we stood on that curb just inches
apart. Her lips parted, chest rising and falling in staggered breaths.
Fuck, I should have just kissed her. Should have slid my hands into her
hair and pulled her close and kissed her until we were both breathless. Then
I should have taken her up to my apartment and thanked her properly for
the ride.
I shift on the stool, the longing that's been dormant stirring to life again.
Rhodes gives me a smug grin at my canned response. “Just face it—
you're deprived.”
I roll my eyes, then signal the bartender for another—and final—beer.
He pops the top off of a local IPA and slides it in front of me…along
with a napkin.
There's a feminine scrawl across it, and before he says anything, I know
who it's from.
“From those two at the end,” the bartender says, tossing his thumb over
his shoulder. “I told them you weren't interested, but they wouldn't take no
for an answer.”
Slapshots has become a haven of sorts for the team. The owner is a big
fan of the Comets and lets us come here all the time after games. The other
patrons tend to leave us alone and let us do our thing, but every now and
then there are a few people who don't understand the unwritten rule and
butt into our downtime.
Like tonight.
“Thanks, Rod.”
He gives me a nod before wandering off to take care of another
customer.
Rhodes glances down at the women who were checking him out earlier.
The minute his eyes land on them, they lean forward, pressing their tits out,
grinning at us.
“Well, I found you some action.”
“And wind up like Colter with two baby mamas?” I shake my head.
“I'll pass.”
“Three—he's up to three now. And why not? They're hot.”
I shrug. “Just not into it.”
“Who is she?”
“Who is who?”
Rhodes lifts his brows. “Dude, I've known you almost half my life now.
Don't play stupid with me. Who is the girl? Did you meet someone this
summer? Is that why you're not taking those very willing girls up on their
offer?”
“If you like them so much, why don't you take them up on their offer?”
He gives me a hard stare.
I sigh, knowing he's not going to let it go. “There is no girl, Rhodes.”
“If there's no girl, then walk over there.”
“Not interested.”
He opens his mouth to say something, but I shake my head. He snaps it
closed again.
I guzzle down another drink of my beer.
“Okay, fine,” Rhodes says after a minute of silence. “If you won't go
talk to them, at least find someone to help with your problem.” He bounces
his brows up and down like I don't know what he's talking about.
“Why are you so worried about what I'm doing—or not doing—with
my dick?”
“Because it affects the team, man!” He says it like it's the most obvious
thing in the world. “If you're out there and you're not relaxed, you're not
playing well. If you don't play well, we get fucked again and don't get the
Cup…again.”
I flinch at his words, even though I know it's nothing personal. Still
fucking stings worse than taking a puck to the thigh.
I hold my palm up. “I have a solution right here.”
He smacks my hand down. “You are an NHL all-star defenseman. You
do not—under any circumstances—walk your own dog. That's like a law or
something.”
I laugh. “A law, huh?”
“Yep.” He puffs his chest out, doubling down. “It's blasphemous when
you have so many options practically knocking down your door.”
“You're telling me when Brittney isn't off doing whomever it is she
does”—he narrows his eyes—“you don't…relax yourself?”
He sighs. “First, my relationship”—I scoff at his use of the word and he
throws me a murderous glare—“with Brittney isn't nearly as dramatic as
you make it out to be. We're more together than we aren't.”
I don't know what delusional world he's living in, but I'll allow it for
now.
“But a few times when we've…broken up,” he continues, “it's not like
I've been celibate myself.”
Now this is surprising.
“Who?”
He shrugs. “A few different women. It wasn't a big deal.”
“Yeah, but who? How? I haven't seen you go home with anyone in…
well, since long before Brittney.”
“Iuseapps.” He tips his drink back, not meeting my eyes.
“Dude, what?”
He huffs, setting his beer back down. “I said, I use apps.”
“What the fuck for?”
Another shrug. “It's…easier. I'm not exactly the best at picking women
up, you know.” He points at the long scar that slashes through his lips and
up his cheek. “Not many are clamoring to get with this ugly mug.”
I met Rhodes the summer before he got his scar. We went to the same
hockey camp in Minnesota and clicked fast. Back then, he was loud and
cocky, but after he took a dirty skate to the face, leaving him with a deep
scar after the reconstructive surgery he had to have, he changed. Now, he's
quiet. Some might even say broody. He works harder at blending in than
standing out, and I know that has to do with what happened. He thinks it's
all people see.
I think his scar might have to do with why he keeps going back to
Brittney. She's comfortable to him. Safe. She doesn't care about his scar.
Just his wallet size.
But that's a whole other thing.
“What do they say when you show up and it's you?”
“I don't really think about that in the moment. It's no different from
going home with a bunny, I guess. I'm not there for the conversation, and
they don't want one either.”
I suppose it would be a lot like that. It's not like I haven't done it before,
taken home a bunny I mean. I just haven't done it in a long time. When you
come into the NHL, your first few years are magical when it comes to
women. They all want you for the title, and most of the guys give in to that
temptation—myself included.
After a while, it gets old.
But the nights alone get old too.
I'm not in the market for anything serious. I want easy, dirty fun.
Something casual to help channel all my extra…frustrations.
Maybe this app thing is the perfect solution to that.
“What app do you use?”
His eyes widen, brows shooting into his dark blond hairline. A slow grin
pulls at his lips. “I knew you were sex-deprived.”
“It's for the team,” I mumble.
Though neither of us believes me.

HARPER
“I'm telling you, Harp, you should have seen the way he was looking at me.
It was like he wanted to reach over the counter and strangle me.”
“Well, you did tell him his bald patch was blinding you.”
“Because it was!”
I laugh, shaking my head at my best friend, Ryan.
“You know we're on FaceTime and I can see you, right?”
“Oh, I am well aware.”
She's sitting outside of a coffee shop, sipping what looks like bitter
black coffee and scarfing down her lunch while she's on break from the
salon.
We're both artists in our own way. Her medium is makeup. Mine is…
well, anything I can use to make something spooky.
I grab a zombie doll and hold it in front of the phone, and Ryan
screams.
“Dammit, Harper! You know I hate those damn things!”
I laugh and set the doll aside.
“I seriously hate it when you're in your studio on the phone. It's so…
creepy.”
She's not entirely wrong. The walls are lined with movie posters, molds,
and caster pieces, and horror-themed props are sitting everywhere. It's
unsettling for anyone not into the genre.
“All right, fine. I get the hint. Just let me finish up this cut real quick
and I'll take a break.”
Carefully, I move my scalpel through the belly of the doll, making sure I
get the lines just how I want them, then pull the stuffing out and set it aside.
I'm left with a deflated baby doll that I'm going to cover with burlap,
then fill with black moss and bugs and creepy crawly things to make a baby
Oogie Boogie.
When I'm satisfied with my stopping point, I grab my phone and head
out of my studio to the kitchen to make some coffee.
An order set to go out tomorrow catches my eye: a Freddy Krueger doll.
I instantly think of Collin.
I was crushed when he didn't ask for my number. I wasn't about to offer
mine up so I could just be the pathetic girl who sits by her phone waiting
for the mysterious, sexy stranger to call.
I might not be in the greatest state sex-life-wise, but I'm not that
desperate…yet.
“All right. Run it by me again—what did this guy look like?” Ryan says
like she knows I'm thinking about him.
I called her the morning after I dropped Collin off and told her
everything. She was not happy about me letting a strange man into my car,
but that was soon forgotten when I told her how hot he is.
There hasn't been one day this week that she hasn't brought him up.
Which means there hasn't been one day this week that I haven't thought
about him.
Okay, fine—so I don't have to wait for Ryan to bring him up to think
about him. He's stuck in my head all on his own.
But I don't think I can be blamed.
Collin was hot.
Like ridiculously so.
Maybe even the hottest man I have ever seen before, and I was once
twenty feet from Shemar Moore at an airport.
But I don't know anything about him, so finding him is next to
impossible.
Besides, if I do happen across him, how am I going to explain that I was
looking for him?
Oh, hey. Remember me? I'm that crazy chick who almost hit you with
my car and then coerced you into said car, forced you to eat pickled
sausages, and gave you sex eyes for hours on end? Yeah, just wanted to see
what you're up to.
I highly doubt that's going to go over well.
Besides, I'm sure he's forgotten all about me by now, which is what I
should do too—forget about him. The city is big. If I haven't run into him
before now, I likely never will.
“No. I think you've done enough internet sleuthing to last a lifetime.”
“Clearly I haven't done enough because we haven't found him yet.”
Ryan is determined to track him down. In her romance-loving heart, our
meeting on the highway that night and both being weirdly obsessed with
horror movies was fate.
I tried to tell her that her logic isn't sound because he works in the
sports industry and I hate sports, but she went and pointed out my Carolina
Comets bumper sticker and how maybe that's what magically drew us
together.
“Because I don't know anything about him and he wanted it that way.”
Collin was evasive the whole night, careful not to give me any personal
details. I know he was being cautious. He wasn't just a stranger to me; I
was a stranger to him too.
But now I kind of wish I had something to go off.
“Fine. If you won't let me stalk your hot-as-hell hitchhiker so you two
can fall madly in love, at least let me finally set up a profile for you on
BeeMine and you can find true love there. Or at least a good dick to ride for
a while. You look like you need a good dicking.”
The guy sitting at the table behind Ryan coughs out a laugh, his coffee
spilling across the table.
She spins around. “Eavesdrop much?”
I have to stifle my own laugh at her abrasiveness, never mind that she's
in a public setting and talking loudly.
That's just who Ryan is. We met at orientation our freshman year of art
school and hit it off immediately, which is funny because while we're
similar in a lot of ways, we're just as opposite in others.
Where Ryan is a die-hard romantic, outgoing, and snarky, I'm reserved
and quiet, preferring to sit at home and get my thrills in the form of a scary
movie, not going out.
And then of course there's our difference in artistic interests.
Makeup isn't the only thing she's good at. She knows how to work a
camera better than anyone I know, and she's aware of it too. It's how she's
amassed over a million followers across Instagram and YouTube with her
makeup tutorials and photography skills.
“Anyway,” she continues, tossing her long, honey-blonde curls behind
her shoulder. “As I was saying, let me set you up a profile and match you
with somebody. That way when you eventually do run into Hot Hitchhiker
again, you can be like, ‘No, sorry, I'm taken because you're an idiot and
didn't ask for my number.'” She claps her hands together excitedly. “Yes!
Let's do that!”
“No. Absolutely not.”
“Absolutely yes.”
“Ryan…”
“Harper…” she mocks, then lifts her dark green eyes skyward. “Come
on. We both know you're not as happy being single as you're pretending to
be.”
I push off the counter I've been leaning on and set the phone down
against a flower vase.
I reach for a mug, then pluck an espresso pod from the top drawer of my
coffee station.
One thing I wanted most when I finally got my own apartment was a
coffee bar filled with different ways to make my favorite crutch.
I squirt two pumps of vanilla and one of lavender into my mug, pop the
pod into the machine, and let it work its magic. I grab creamer from the
fridge and take a whiff, the sweet cream hitting my senses, then pour a
healthy dose into the frother I have and work it into a nice fluff.
“Why don't you just go to a coffee shop like a normal person?” Ryan
says.
“Because coffee shops are expensive.”
“Yeah, but they put love into their coffees here.”
“Plenty of sass too. That barista at Cup of Joe's is always giving out
death stares.”
“And I give them right back.”
“Ryan the Lion,” I tease, using the nickname I gave her in college.
She lifts her hands and growls, then winks.
I laugh.
After my father died, my mother was protective to the point that it was
suffocating me. I had to beg for over a year to get her to allow me to apply
to art school just on the other side of the state. When I finally got there and
experienced what it was like to not be under her thumb, I felt free for the
first time in years.
So, during school, I worked my ass off to save up money, and after
graduation, I stayed.
Even though it's been three years since I graduated, my mother asks me
to move back weekly. But I don't regret it for a second.
I owe Ryan for that. She pulled me out of my shell, forced me to stand
up for myself. And I love her dearly for it.
I grab my finished espresso, pour my foam concoction on top of it, and
finish it off with a few shakes of cinnamon. I take a sip as I grab my phone
and walk outside to my little patio area.
I might not live in the heart of downtown, but I'm perfectly okay with
that. I have an excellent view of the city from my balcony without all the
extra noise.
“As for your accusation regarding my happiness, it's not true. I'm fine
with being single.”
She cackles at my answer, so loud and creepy I swear it came straight
from a horror movie. “I love how you think you can lie to me.”
“I'm not lying.”
She doesn't say anything. Just pins me with a stare that makes me
shrink back.
“Stop looking at me like that.”
“No. Not until you admit you're lying.”
“I'm—”
“Harper Dolores Kelly!”
I groan. “Don't bring out the middle name.”
“Then admit it.”
“Fine!” I say a little too loudly. “Fine, I'm a little lonely at times, but
it's nothing that's crushing. You happy?”
“Yes.” She smiles triumphantly, then realizes what she said. “Well, no.
I'm not happy you're lonely—just happy you finally admitted it.” She taps
her fingertips together. “Now, let me fix it.”
“With a dating app?”
“Yes!”
“Come on, Ryan.” I scoff. “Those things are just for hooking up.
Everyone knows that.”
“First, what's wrong with just hooking up? You clearly need it. And
second, that's not true. Look at Charlie.”
She's referring to her co-worker who met a guy on some app last year.
They fell madly in love with each other and just got engaged last week.
Ryan has forced me out a few times, and I've seen them together. It's
sickening how cute they are.
“She was the exception.”
I've never done the whole dating-app thing before. The few boyfriends
I've had, I met at school or through mutual friends. I will admit that since I
started working from home, it has been lonely at times, and if I ever did
want to meet someone, my options would be pretty limited.
Hmm…perhaps online dating wouldn't be the worst idea ever.
“I'll come over tonight,” Ryan says like she can read my mind and
knows I'm considering it. “We can order some subs, watch a movie, and
work on your profile together.”
Her eyes are bright with excitement, and she's clearly loving her plan.
I love the part about subs and a movie.
The app part? Not so much.
Truthfully, I'm in no rush to get into anything serious. But I guess
finding someone to have fun with for a bit wouldn't be so bad.
“Fine,” I concede.
She claps her hands together, squealing with delight.
“But!” I interrupt her celebration. “When I say I'm done, I'm done. No
arguments. Got it?”
She holds her hands up to show me she's not crossing her fingers and
says, “I promise.”
“I don't trust you. You're probably crossing that weird lucky toe of
yours.”
“Ohmygosh.” She glances around, making sure nobody heard me. “You
bitch! I hate you. I'll bring the wine. See you tonight. Love you. Bye.”
“Wow. You're just really putting it all out there, aren't you?”
“What?” I take a sip from my wineglass. It's my third and I'm definitely
feeling the effects. I'm not a big drinker, and sweet wine is about all I can
handle. “I'd rather be honest about my passions upfront than spring it on
him later.”
“True, true. But it's so…” I narrow my eyes and she holds her hands up.
“Fine. Tell him all about your freak-show obsession, then.”
I type and erase…then do it again.
“There,” I finally say, holding the phone up to her face. “How's this?”
We've been curled up on my couch for two hours now, a bottle of wine
gone between the two of us, two sub boxes empty on the coffee table, and
The Haunting of Hill House playing in the background for noise.
Ryan snatches my phone from my hand and reads it over, types a few
things, then smiles.
“There. That's it.”
I look at the screen, eyes wide.
“Ryan! You cannot put that in there!”
She shrugs. “Why not? It's true, isn't it?”
My cheeks heat, and she laughs at my discomfort like a brat.
I grab the phone and erase the swallowing part she tacked on to the end,
then read it through again.
I'm an awkward, horror-loving artist. I love dogs more than people,
and I don't trust anyone who doesn't drink coffee. I'm not looking for
a Michael to my Laurie. AKA I want a fun time, not a long time. No
creeps and no foot fetishes. No exceptions.
It's…shit.
Absolute shit.
I can't do this. I can't sign up on some dating app. I am not cut out for
this.
A long, perfectly manicured finger comes into view, and before I know
it, a screen is popping up saying Congratulations! Your profile is now live.
“Now you can't back out.” Ryan grins at me smugly.
“I can just delete the profile.”
“You could…but you won't because you love me.”
Crap. She's right.
I toss my head back on a sigh. “Ugh. This is so not for me, Ryan. You're
the outgoing, fun one. I'm the laid-back, awkward one. Online dating? It's
so…”
“Perfect. It's perfect. You're behind a screen. You're able to just be
yourself. And the best part is, if you don't like someone, you just stop
talking to them. That's way better than trying to meet someone in real life
where you have to be all polite and shit and can't just walk away.” She lifts
a shoulder. “I can't believe we didn't do this for you before, honestly.”
“Because if I were in my right mind, I would have never agreed to this.”
“But you're lonely, so you did.”
There she goes using that word again.
Lonely.
Until I left Collin standing on that curb, I didn't realize just how alone I
was feeling.
Talking to him was easy and fun. I didn't realize I missed that simple
connection with another person until I walked away from it.
I miss laughing. I miss that jolt of electricity when arms brush together.
I miss being smiled at. Being teased. Heard.
Seen.
I'm not going to hold my breath that this online-dating thing pans out.
But maybe it wouldn't be such a bad thing if it did.

COLLIN
“No fucking way.”
I sit up, my blanket pooling around my waist as I stare down at my
phone in disbelief.
I click on the image to bring up the profile. I read the bio, laughing at
the obvious Halloween reference. There are only three images, but I'd know
that flirty smile anywhere.
“Harper.”
I say her name out loud for the first time since I watched her drive
away, and it doesn't escape me how much I like saying it.
For the first time since Rhodes convinced me to sign up for this stupid
app, I'm actually excited.
All of my time over the last two weeks has been spent on the ice
training and playing exhibition games, so I haven't had a chance to do much
other than scroll a bit. I've seen at least four profiles with the same images,
one who only had pictures of her feet, and another for a woman who looked
old enough to be my mother.
That was enough to keep me away for a while.
But with the regular season starting soon, I need to get my shit together
and fast.
So finding Harper? The girl I haven't been able to forget? Yeah, it lights
a fucking spark.
Before I can talk myself out of it, I hit MATCH, then go back to her
profile, looking through the few photos again.
The first one is of her and a friend. They have their arms around one
another and are smiling at the camera. It looks like they're at some sort of
dressy function. Her friend is blonde and definitely hot, but that's not where
my focus is. It's on the floor-length navy-blue dress that seems to fit Harper
like it was made for her, showing off her curves and her tits that I know
were definitely hiding on our car ride because I'd remember them
otherwise. Her hair is curlier than when I met her and she's wearing a lot
more makeup, but she still looks beautiful.
The second is closer to the Harper I met. She's wearing a worn
Fleetwood Mac shirt that looks legit vintage, not one she just picked up at
the store, and a pair of cutoff shorts similar to the ones she wore before.
Those same glittery Converse are on her feet.
The third is one of her at a Halloween party. She's dressed up as a dead
camper from Camp Crystal Lake, and it makes me laugh because it just
seems so…her.
A notification fills my screen.
YOU HAVE BEEN MATCHED!
It goes through several screens of rules for the app—like how we can
report users for being inappropriate and unmatch at any time—before I'm
finally able to send something.
I type out a few messages.
Hey. It's Collin. You know, that guy you almost hit with your car.
Straight to the point.
I know what you did this summer.
Hmm. It works with her whole horror theme, but it's also creepy as shit.
SHOW ME THEM TITTIES
I erase that last one immediately, then glare at my dick because I know it's
him talking. Take it down a notch, bud.
The truth is, I don't know how to start this conversation with her. Which
sucks because talking to her before came so easy.
Now, I don't know what to say.
I could tell her it's me, but that's going to go one of two ways.
1. She'll laugh at the weird coincidence and we'll jump back into our
banter.
2. She's going to think I'm a total weirdo and that I stalked her online.
I'd really hope it's the first one, but I also don't want to take my chances.
Before I can send anything, a message from her pops up.
HorrorHarper: I'm a big fan of honesty, so here goes: I only
clicked MATCH because of your taste in movies. I'm not a
sports person at all. *waits to be unmatched*
I'm a big fan of honesty.
Fuck.
I can't tell her it's me.
I never told her I played hockey. If I tell her it's me, she's going to ask
me about my handle. Then she's going to realize I didn't tell her the whole
truth about me and she'll no doubt be pissed.
I should unmatch us. Should forget about her. Just move on.
My finger hovers over the UNMATCH button.
One second ticks by.
Then another.
Five more.
I can't do it.
Because I can't not talk to her.
Spending those few hours in the car with her were some of the best
moments I've had in a long time.
I want to feel that again.
HockeyGuy69: You don't know what you're missing, then.
Hockey is life.
HorrorHarper: A bunch of grown men ramming into each other
while they chase down a slice of plastic? No, thanks.
HockeyGuy69: It's rubber, not plastic.
HockeyGuy69: And it sounds very sexual when you use the
word “ramming.” They're called hits for a reason, you know.
HorrorHarper: I'm not sure you can complain about sexual
innuendos with the number 69 in your handle.
I feel a little immature having picked that number, but I never thought I'd
find anyone that interesting on this app.
HockeyGuy69: I actually meant to type in 96, but I guess we'll
call it a happy accident. Bob Ross would be proud.
HorrorHarper: Please do not tell me you actually think 69-ing
is fun. It's…so much work. Completely overrated. You have to
worry about not suffocating a guy AND doing your part. It's not
fun at all.
HockeyGuy69: If the man you're 69-ing with doesn't want to
be suffocated, you're with the wrong man.
HorrorHarper: That is…noted.
I laugh.
Yeah, this is definitely Harper.
HorrorHarper: So, Hockey Guy, got a name?
Fuck. Fuck. Shit. Fuck.
I somehow wasn't prepared for that question at all.
What the fuck do I tell her?
HockeyGuy69: I do.
HorrorHarper: Well? You already know mine. Fair is fair.
HockeyGuy69: Wright.
HorrorHarper: Your name is Wright?
HockeyGuy69: Yep.
It's not a complete lie.
It's my last name.
And it's a test.
With my handle being hockey-related and my obvious reference to my
jersey number, if she really isn't a hockey fan, she'll have no clue it's me.
This will also mean she wasn't lying the night I met her—she really
didn't know me.
I swallow down the bile that rises in my throat.
She's not the liar. I am.
HorrorHarper: That's…different. I like it.
HockeyGuy69: Thanks, but I can't take any credit for it.
HockeyGuy69: What's your favorite scary movie?
HorrorHarper: No. Please. Stop. The originality is killing me.
HorrorHarper: Also, it's Halloween. I know, I know—not the
most original answer. But it's a classic and it breathed life into
the horror genre.
I knew that. At least Collin knew that.
But Wright didn't.
HockeyGuy69: Eh. Freddy's better.
HorrorHarper: You know, I had someone tell me that same
thing recently.
Oh shit.
HorrorHarper: He was wrong too.
HockeyGuy69: *right
HockeyGuy69: So, Harper, tell me about yourself.
HorrorHarper: Well, I like long walks alone in the woods, enjoy
taking showers when there's a killer on the loose, and never,
ever turn down the chance to yell, “Who's there?” when I hear
a strange noise in my apartment, even though I live alone.
I laugh. Smartass.
HockeyGuy69: That actually made me laugh out loud.
HorrorHarper: Thank you. I'll be here all night.
HorrorHarper: Wait—that sounded way too desperate, like I'll
be sleeping with my phone next to me all night.
HorrorHarper: I mean, I WILL be sleeping with my phone next
to me. It's also my alarm clock because who actually owns an
alarm clock anymore? I'm not a psychologist, but I feel like
that's a red flag of some sort.
HorrorHarper: I'm going to just stop talking now.
HockeyGuy69: What if I told you I have an alarm clock?
HorrorHarper: OH GOD. *dies of embarrassment*
HockeyGuy69: I'm kidding. It's definitely a red flag.
HorrorHarper: *wipes brow* Phew!
HorrorHarper: I really was kidding about being here all night
though. I was just crawling into bed when I got the match
notification. I should probably try to get some sleep.
HockeyGuy69: You're…in bed?
HorrorHarper: I am NOT sending you pictures of me in bed.
HockeyGuy69: I didn't ask for any.
HorrorHarper: Is this some sort of reverse psychology thing
where you think that just because you're all “gentlemanly” I'll
be like, “Poor dude, here's a tit pic”?
HockeyGuy69: Are you offering a tit pic?
HorrorHarper: What?! NO!
HorrorHarper: Oh god. This is going awful.
HorrorHarper: Please feel free to unmatch me at any time
now.
HockeyGuy69: Nah. I don't scare that easily.
HorrorHarper: Is that a red flag?
HockeyGuy69: You're the psychologist. You tell me.
HorrorHarper: I said I WASN'T one. I'm an artist.
HockeyGuy69: Artist? What kind?
HorrorHarper: Nope, sorry, Hockey Guy. I'm tired. You'll get
answers tomorrow.
HockeyGuy69: Does this mean I get to talk to you again?
HorrorHarper: That's up to you.
HorrorHarper: Good night, Wright.
HockeyGuy69: Night, Harper.
I was destined to love hockey since the day I was born and came home from
the hospital wrapped in my father's old St. Louis Blues t-shirt.
Once, when I was four, I slipped away from my parents to go to the
frozen pond out on our property and glided around for the ten minutes it
took them to find me.
I got my butt whooped, but my parents could see it that day too—the ice
is where I belong.
So, they bought me skates and signed me up for everything I was old
enough for. I was a natural. Born to be out here. Hockey became second
nature to me.
The ice? It's my home. It's where I feel most comfortable. Where I find
my peace.
So the fact that I'm playing like shit right now? It fucking blows.
“Come on, Wright. Get it together, man. Tape to fucking tape, not tape
to the Indian Ocean.”
I grimace at Coach's words. He's been on my ass every day and has
every right to be. If it's not Rhodes out on the ice to catch my puck, it's not
going to hit the tape.
It's official: I'm off my game, and everyone knows it.
Maybe Rhodes was onto something about the stress after all. Maybe I
do need to find a way to unwind, to get my mind off last season.
Or maybe it's the fact that I couldn't sleep last night because I couldn't
stop thinking about Harper.
I can't believe I found her.
Well, I didn't find her.
I stumbled upon her. On a dating app.
The girl I haven't been able to get out of my head has fallen back into
my lap just as randomly as she did the first time.
A big, six-foot-four frame skids to a stop in front of me. “Get your head
in the game. We can't have you blowing our chance at the Cup again.”
Colter came to the team last year when we were primed to win the Cup.
I think he's the saltiest of them all that I let the team down.
I grit my teeth.
Don't react. Don't react. Don't fucking react.
“Hey, Colter, get anyone else pregnant this weekend?” Rhodes bumps
into the giant hard enough to knock him off-balance. “What? Your mama
not teach you to wrap your willy, silly?”
Colter glares at him, and I don't bother to try to hide my smirk.
It really shouldn't be funny that Rhodes, who is wider than me and has a
good inch or two on my frame, is calling a grown-ass man silly, but it is.
And it pisses Colter right off.
He glares at Rhodes and gets up in his face. The two stare each other
down.
“Just a friendly reminder,” Rhodes says, “these hands are rated E for
everyone. I don't give a shit if you're my teammate or not.”
I should get in the way, try to pull them apart, but a sick part of me
would love to watch Rhodes take Colter down a few notches. He's a big
fucker, but Rhodes is the kind of guy you don't want to drop the gloves
with. He might be the laid-back quiet one most of the time, but when you
set him off, he's really off.
“Something wrong, boys?” Lowell stops in front of us, eyes bouncing
between the three of us.
After several beats, Colter drops back, sneering over at Rhodes. “It's
nothing, Cap.”
“Good,” Lowell says, ignoring the dig, probably used to it. “Let's get
back to it, then.”
Lowell waits for Colter to skate away before turning to face Rhodes and
me.
“Does it make me a bad captain to say I fucking hate that kid?”
Rhodes grins. “No. Guy's a fucking cock.”
“A cock?”
“Yeah,” Rhodes calls over his shoulder as he skates away. “Ugly and
weak.”
Lowell shakes his head, watching as Rhodes intentionally skates up to
Colter and steals his puck, taunting him.
“I swear, sometimes it feels like I'm trying to corral children.”
“You're like two years older than us.”
“I stand by what I said.”
I don't challenge him. I'm sure it does feel like that sometimes,
especially with some of these fools.
He steps closer, crossing his arms. “I say this with all the respect in the
world: you're off your shit.”
I sigh. “Fuck, you think I don't know that, man?”
“It's a contract year, yeah?”
I grit my teeth again, not needing that little reminder too, and give him a
single nod.
He looks out at our teammates as they skate effortlessly across the ice.
“I'm pushing for you with the team and with Coach for as long as I can,
but…”
He trails off, and I know where he's going.
I need to get my shit together.
And fast.
“All right. Just wanted you to know I'm here.”
“Thanks, Lowell,” I say quietly.
He nods once, then skates away.
We wrap up practice, and instead of heading home, I hit the gym, trying
to work out my frustrations.
Rhodes comes strolling in, picking up a few dumbbells at the station
beside me.
I'm on a bench doing overhead presses. He's doing some goblet squats.
“Saw you talking to Lowell.” Rhodes finally breaks the silence we've
been working in.
“Yeah.” I do another rep.
“You good?”
“As I can be.”
Another rep.
“You know, I really think you need to—”
“Relax. I know.” I drop my weights with a thud and sit up, resting my
arms on my thighs. “I downloaded that app.”
“Yeah?” He stops doing squats and looks at me with wide eyes. “Meet
anyone yet?”
I give him a noncommittal shrug because I haven't told Rhodes about
Harper yet. I don't know why. Maybe because the story just sounds too
fucking crazy to believe? Maybe I want to keep her to myself for a little
longer? I don't know.
“I heard Miller and Lowell talking about hitting up Slapshots tonight.
We could”—his lips curl—“tag along.”
I laugh. He can barely get the words out. Rhodes is as much of a
homebody as I am.
“I appreciate the willingness to sacrifice a night in, but you don't need
to play my wingman.”
“Thank fuck,” he mutters. “I hate going out.”
“And that's why we get along so well.”
He grunts and returns his weights to the rack. “Wanna come over and
watch some tapes tonight?”
No. I want to stay home and message Harper.
“Probably should,” I say instead. “But I think I'm gonna just try to get
some rest.”
“You should take a bath.”
I don't even pretend to not be shocked by his words. “You take baths?
Like candles, bubbles, the whole thing?”
“Yeah.” He shrugs. “Get the right music going and it's relaxing as
fuck.”
“I'll, uh, take that into consideration.”
“Hey, don't knock that shit until you try it. Besides, it's for the team,
right?”
He lifts a brow, and I know what he's getting at.
You're on thin ice.
I try to push everything out of my mind the rest of my workout, but all
my fuckups are hovering at the periphery, just vying for attention.
After an intense forty-five minutes, I bid goodbye to Rhodes and hit the
showers.
Coach stops me as I'm heading to my car. He doesn't even have to say
anything to me. The disappointment is clear in his eyes.
The fucked-up thing is, I'd rather have my parents disappointed in me
than my coach.
“Maybe go out with a few of the guys, huh? Do some bonding outside
the rink.”
It's not a suggestion. Not really.
“Yes, sir.”
He eyes me, maybe looking for an answer to my problem.
But first, he'd have to narrow it down.
Is it the Game Six loss that's throwing me off? Definitely has something
to do with it. The arrest and digging into my past and all the attention that's
sucked up my energy? Yeah, because that shit blows too. The rest of my
team looking at me like I'm to blame for all their problems? Yep, that's a
big fucking issue.
“You'll get the groove back, kid. Just need a little time.”
But I hear it…that worry lacing his voice.
And I worry too.
Coach gives me a tightlipped smile, then claps me on the back,
dismissing me.
I don't breathe again until I'm tucked safely in my car.
Instead of heading home right away, I grab lunch and head to a local
park, hoping the outdoors might help clear my head a bit.
After a few hours of walking and people-watching, I stop by the garage
that's fixing my Land Cruiser that finally made it here just to check on
things, then I make my way home.
“Hey, Beau,” I say to my seventy-something-year-old doorman when I
walk into my building.
“Mr. Wright! Good evening, sir. Have a good practice today?”
I want to tell him not to call me sir, but I know it's no use. In the four
years I've lived here, he's never listened to me before, and I know he's not
about to start now.
“It was all right. How was your day? Meghan still giving you trouble?”
His eyes light up at the mention of his wife, who he's been with for fifty
years now.
“Always, but she's my favorite kind of trouble, sir.”
It's the same reply he always gives me, and just like always, it makes
me grin.
If there's someone out there who doesn't believe in love, I'd say give
them five minutes with Beau and they'll change their minds.
“Got you something.” I reach into the paper sack I have in my hand,
then give him one of the Oatmeal Creme Pies I picked up at the store down
the block.
His eyes get just as excited as they did when I mentioned his wife. After
a scare last year, Meghan took to making sure Beau only eats healthy foods.
Gone are the snack cakes and cookies he used to bring in to work. It's all
chicken and rice, something he's complained about frequently.
I've been sneaking him some goodies whenever I remember. Not often,
but enough to keep him smiling.
“Just between us,” I say on a wink.
“Thank you.” He looks at the snack like it's his last meal. “Are you in
for the night, sir?”
“I am.”
“Would you like me to call the elevator for you?”
“Nah. I got it.” I pat his shoulder. “Have a good night, Beau.”
“Good night, sir. And thank you again.”
I smile at him, then take the elevator up to the twentieth floor.
I kick off my shoes and pop open a beer as soon as I walk inside. I leave
the bag on the counter and put the beers into the fridge before flopping
down on the couch and turning on the TV.
A mistake.
A big mistake.
My mugshot fills the screen on SportsCenter.
“So, Jonesy, what do you think? Do you think Collin Wright is going to
get a hat trick in handcuffs this year?”
The screen pans over to the cohost, and I hit the power button as soon as
he opens his mouth.
Great. The season hasn't even officially started and I'm already being
harassed.
I blow out a breath and down the rest of my beer, all the frustration that
was just beginning to leave my body hitting me full force again.
“Fuck it,” I mutter, pushing off of the couch.
I drop my empty bottle into the recycling, grab the grocery bag and
another beer, and head to the bathroom.
I set my beer down on the counter, then empty my pockets. I turn the
water on and let it begin filling up the tub I've literally never used in my
four years living here.
The real estate agent was super excited about it when I moved in, telling
me I could use it to recuperate after games, but I've never bothered. The
only kind of bath I've ever taken is an ice bath, and I do those at the rink.
While the tub fills, I grab the bottle of bubbles and Epsom salt I got
from the store and dump a healthy amount of both in. I pull out the single
wick lavender candle I bought and give it a light with the matches I picked
up, then set it on the ledge of the tub.
When the tub is nice and full and the water is steaming, I strip, grab my
beer and Oatmeal Creme Pie—totally fine to eat in the tub, right?—and
climb in.
It's a little warm but not so unbearable I can't get used to it.
I set my phone to some classical music playlist and lean back, closing
my eyes.
Just relax, Collin. Let it all go. You're healthy, you're still young. You
have a fuckton of playing years left. Get out of your head and chill.
I try to conjure up the last time I felt relaxed, and the only thing that
comes to mind is my car ride with Harper.
The way she made me laugh and kept my chicken nuggets sauced. The
way she wasn't afraid to joke around and be playful. Hell, even when she
fell asleep next to me and left me alone with my thoughts, I still felt at ease.
I need that feeling back.
I reach for my phone and pull up BeeMine, clicking back to our
messages from last night. I read them over, smiling at her smartassery.
She said it was up to me if we talked again.
And I really want to talk again.

HARPER
“Just one more…”
I trap my tongue between my lips, something I'm well aware I do when
I'm concentrating extra hard, and give the project at hand all of my
attention.
“There!” I say to nobody at all when I complete the last stitch I've been
painfully gluing on the zombie girl I've been working on for the last four
hours.
I sit back to admire my work. They're gorgeous, maybe some of my
best pieces yet.
It's a custom order for a customer who lives in Canada. She wanted a
matching zombie king and queen for her and her fiancé who are getting
married next month. They're doing a Halloween-themed wedding, and she
wanted to surprise him with them.
I set them aside to sleep on before I decide if they're finished or not. It's
the same thing I do with every project. I believe every artist needs to walk
away from their craft and look at it with a fresh eye in the morning.
Sometimes letting it settle shines a light on the problem areas.
And sometimes it shines a light on the parts you never thought could be
your favorite.
I click my work lamp off, then grab my coffee, which has long since
turned cold, and shut down my studio for the night.
I don't have any plans and could keep working, but I promised myself
when I started my business that I'd set office hours and stick to them.
I dump my cold coffee out, rinse the cup, and refill it with some white
wine before heading to my bedroom to change into my pajamas. I swap my
leggings for shorts and my paint-covered shirt for a camisole, then make my
way back for my wine.
I sigh when I finally settle onto the couch with my drink and a bag of
cheesy popcorn that I plan to devour while I watch more of The Haunting of
Hill House.
Most people react to my love of horror like Ryan—confused and not
into it.
But sometimes people like Collin come along and embrace it.
Collin.
I'll admit it—any time I've left my apartment over the last few weeks,
I've been looking for him. It's silly, really. The chances of running into the
guy are so slim it's unreal, but I can't help but let my eyes wander, seeking
him out.
I thought I might have seen his face on TV the other night when Ryan
forced me out to dinner, but the channel had changed before I could do a
double take.
Besides, why would Collin be on TV?
I pick up my phone while I munch on my popcorn, the Crain family
saga playing in the background while I scroll through social media. Ryan
insisted I set up an account for my business. At first, I resisted because I've
always been wary of social media, but—much like she always does—she
convinced me to give it a shot. Honestly, I'm glad I did. My sales were
good before I had any accounts, but since I began posting regularly, my
orders have really taken off. Now almost half of my custom orders are a
result of posts I make.
My eyes slide up to a notification that comes through, then shift back to
the task at hand.
Wait a minute…
I click the notification from BeeMine and my stomach does a little flip.
HockeyGuy69: So since you were honest with me about your
disdain for hockey—something we'll come back to later—I
have to confess something to you.
HockeyGuy69: I'm 27 years old and I've never taken a bath
before (obviously not counting being a baby), and I'm
currently sitting in a tub full of bubbles.
HorrorHarper: Did you light a candle?
HockeyGuy69: What is it with baths and candles?
HockeyGuy69: And yes.
HorrorHarper: Do you have relaxing music playing?
HockeyGuy69: I do.
HorrorHarper: Have alcohol present? (assuming you drink)
HockeyGuy69: I do, and yes.
HorrorHarper: And are you eating pizza?
HockeyGuy69: I have an Oatmeal Creme Pie.
HorrorHarper: Ding Dongs are better, but I'll allow it.
HockeyGuy69: *barely resists making a dong joke*
HockeyGuy69: But thank you. So glad I have your approval. I
was worried you'd judge me.
HorrorHarper: For bathing? It's more than most men do.
HockeyGuy69: I'd be offended, but yeah, you're right.
HorrorHarper: Honestly, it makes me a little jealous. I wish I
could be in the tub with you right now.
HorrorHarper: WAIT.
HorrorHarper: NO.
HorrorHarper: ABORT ABORT!
HorrorHarper: I meant in the tub too. Like in general. And
alone. But like…still with you because we'd be messaging.
HorrorHarper: Yeah, that's totally what I meant.
HorrorHarper: Wow. This conversation is already going really
well.
HorrorHarper: Scare you off yet?
HockeyGuy69: Not even close. I kind of like it when you get
yourself all worked up over me.
HockeyGuy69: Oh shit. I think you're rubbing off on me.
HorrorHarper: As long as you're not rubbing off on me, we're
fine.
I stare down at my phone in disbelief.
NO!
No, no, no.
What the hell is wrong with you, Harper? This is why you can't find
anyone to date. You're awkward. You say the first thing that pops into your
head. Get a grip, woman!
HockeyGuy69: Well, that took a turn.
HockeyGuy69: Now I'm really wishing I made that dong joke
after all.
HorrorHarper: To be fair, you started this conversation off on
the wrong foot.
HorrorHarper: Messaged me just to brag about you being
naked.
HorrorHarper: I'm onto you.
HockeyGuy69: If only you were ON me instead…
HockeyGuy69: There. Now we're even.
HorrorHarper: You did that on purpose to make me feel better.
HockeyGuy69: Did it work?
HorrorHarper: A little.
HockeyGuy69: Change of subject…
HorrorHarper: Are you supposed to warn about those? Or just
glide right into it?
HockeyGuy69: *scrapes mind out of gutter*
HockeyGuy69: We're naturals at this.
HorrorHarper: Totally not awkward at all.
HockeyGuy69: Not one bit.
HockeyGuy69: So, you mentioned last night that you're an
artist. What kind?
HorrorHarper: Finally! A safe subject!
HorrorHarper: My medium is YES and my specialty is horror.
Shocking, I know.
HockeyGuy69: Medium?
HorrorHarper: Yeah, what I use to create my art. Like for a
painter, their medium is what they paint on or what types of
paint they use. A sculptor would be stone or clay. Mine is a
little bit of everything.
HorrorHarper: I make a lot of props, sometimes for lowbudget movies or displays for haunted houses. I sell stuff
online and make custom orders too. And whenever I'm feeling
in the mood, I paint and put those up in a local gallery that
sells creations from artists in the area.
HockeyGuy69: Wow. You do all that? I feel kind of lazy now.
HockeyGuy69: *sips beer in bathtub*
HorrorHarper: It's really nothing that impressive.
HockeyGuy69: Somehow, I doubt that.
HorrorHarper: What about you? Any artistic abilities?
HockeyGuy69: Not really.
HorrorHarper: What do you do for a living?
HockeyGuy69: Sports industry.
A sense of déjà vu hits me.
Sports industry? Where have I heard that response before?
HockeyGuy69: Sorry. I know you're not a sports fan. I won't
bore you with the details.
HorrorHarper: Well, it's not really fair that I get to talk about
my hobbies and you can't talk about yours.
HockeyGuy69: It's fine. I'd rather find out more about you
anyway. Did you always want to be an artist?
HorrorHarper: No. I used to want to be a country singer. Then
I realized I couldn't sing for shit.
HockeyGuy69: I'm sure it's not THAT bad.
HorrorHarper: When I was a kid, my parents took my sister
and me to this local bar that did family karaoke on Sunday
nights. I literally got booed off the stage.
HorrorHarper: I was 12.
HockeyGuy69: They booed a 12-year-old off stage?!
HorrorHarper: Someone even threw a sugar packet at me.
HorrorHarper: Either they really hated “Tim McGraw” or I was
that bad.
HockeyGuy69: That sounds traumatizing.
HorrorHarper: I swear I still have stage fright because of it.
HorrorHarper: My parents also paid me to not audition for
American Idol because they didn't want to be embarrassed
when they inevitably played my awful audition on TV.
HockeyGuy69: That's oddly sweet of them.
HockeyGuy69: I was Peter Pan in my middle school play and
farted when I was lifted by the harness to fly.
HockeyGuy69: IN A SILENT AUDITORIUM!
HockeyGuy69: They called me Peter Fartknocker until tenth
grade.
HorrorHarper: 10th grade?! That's a commitment.
HockeyGuy69: Yeah, I finally hit my growth spurt and had like
four inches and twenty pounds on everyone. They shut up
after that.
HorrorHarper: How tall are you?
HockeyGuy69: 6'3”
I rub my thighs together.
I've always had a thing for tall men.
Not that it's shocking. I'm only five foot four. Practically everyone is
taller than me.
HockeyGuy69: You know what they say about tall hockey
players, right?
HorrorHarper: I'm honestly not sure if it'll be worse for you to
say big dicks, socks, or shoes.
HockeyGuy69: Big sticks.
HorrorHarper: Hockey joke? That's the worst one for sure.
HockeyGuy69: I'm just glad you picked up on it. Maybe you
don't hate hockey as much as you claim.
HorrorHarper: No comment.
HockeyGuy69: I'll woo you over to the dark side soon enough.
HorrorHarper: Is that what you're trying to do? Woo me, Peter
Fartknocker?
HockeyGuy69: *narrows eyes* Well, not anymore, Miss Not
American Idol. I got a bucket and a perfectly good tune to put
in it, unlike some people.
HorrorHarper: Ouch. That one kind of stung.
HockeyGuy69: Something tells me you can take it.
HockeyGuy69: Please don't take this the wrong way, but I'm
falling asleep.
HorrorHarper: Oh, yeah, totally not offended AT ALL.
HorrorHarper: *is totally offended*
HockeyGuy69: The bath kicked my ass. How do women take
those all the time?
HorrorHarper: In our defense, we're always exhausted
because we have to deal with men. We're used to it.
HockeyGuy69: Ouch. That one kind of stung.
I laugh at his repetition of my words.
HockeyGuy69: Can I talk to you again?
I smile down at my phone, loving how that's twice now he's asked that.
Most guys wouldn't. They'd just message asking what I'm wearing or use
no pretenses and send a dick pic instead.
It's…thoughtful that he asks.
HorrorHarper: That's up to you.
HockeyGuy69: Then that's a yes.
HockeyGuy69: Night, Harper.
HorrorHarper: Night, Hockey Guy.
HockeyGuy69: If you could travel anywhere in the world right
now, where would you go?
I grin as I read the message from Wright, coming in right on time.
I've just curled up on the couch after declining an invitation to go out
with Ryan and her friend from the salon. I know I'll have to make it up to
her later, but I've been so busy trying to get these custom orders done on
time and keep putting it off.
HorrorHarper: To Scotland.
HockeyGuy69: Why?
HorrorHarper: Do you even have to ask? The accents, duh!
HorrorHarper: Also so I could bring home a hot Scot and my
mom would finally get off my butt about finding love or
whatever.
HockeyGuy69: Oof. Guess I'm out of the running, then. No
accent here.
HorrorHarper: That's too bad. I was kind of hoping you were
an expat from Scotland. Or maybe even Australia.
HockeyGuy69: *don't make a down under joke, don't make a
down under joke*
HorrorHarper: I'd almost be disappointed if you didn't at least
think of one.
HockeyGuy69: Because you'd expect nothing less from a guy
with 69 in his handle?
HorrorHarper: Yes.
HockeyGuy69: You miss a hundred percent of the shots you
don't take.
HorrorHarper: Okay, Gretzky.
HockeyGuy69: Thought you weren't a hockey fan.
HorrorHarper: Don't get too excited. Everyone knows that
quote. Just like everyone knows it was really Michael Scott
who said it.
HockeyGuy69: *adds The Office fan to list of things I dig
about you*
HorrorHarper: I want to hear more about this list…
HockeyGuy69: Nah. Haven't earned it yet.
HorrorHarper: Boo. You suck.
HorrorHarper: What about you? Where would you go for
vacation?
HockeyGuy69: Gonna sound lame, but I'd go back home. Not
permanently or anything, but just for a breather. I visited
recently and realized how much I miss such a slow-paced life
and my family, especially my brother.
HorrorHarper: It's not lame. It's actually kind of sweet.
HorrorHarper: Are you and your brother close?
HockeyGuy69: Very. We're less than two years apart and
we've always been tight.
HockeyGuy69: Do you have any siblings?
HorrorHarper: One sister. She's older by two years and a
huge pain in my ass sometimes. She just recently got
engaged and my mom is over the moon about it and won't
stop asking when it's my turn next.
HockeyGuy69: I'd propose to help you out, but I just don't
think we're there yet. Maybe next week.
HorrorHarper: Next week, huh? So sure we'll still be talking
then?
HockeyGuy69: I thought it was up to me.
HorrorHarper: Huh. I did say that, didn't I?
HockeyGuy69: You did.
HockeyGuy69: And since it's up to me, yes, we'll still be
talking then.
HockeyGuy69: Night, Harper.
HorrorHarper: Good night, Wright.

COLLIN
We lost four of our exhibition games. Sure, they aren't anything to truly
sweat over, but it still sucks.
But that's not what has me wanting to toss my dinner back up.
What's killing me is that I know I'm playing like shit and I can't seem
to get my act together. With the regular season starting in just two days—
and starting on the road no less—it's beginning to worry me more and
more.
Am I done? Washed up? Is hockey…over for me?
“So, is this something we need to be worrying about?”
I glance across the table at my agent. His water cup is held loosely in
one hand, arm slung across the chair next to him. His leg is pulled up,
resting on his knee as he regards me carefully.
To most, he'd appear calm, nonchalant even.
But not to me.
I see the trepidation in his eyes, and I'm sure it matches my own.
More than anything, I want to answer his question with a resounding no.
Want to reassure him that it's nothing. That I'm just still shaking off the bad
vibes of last season and I'll be ready when the season officially starts.
But I know he'll see right fucking through me.
So I don't say anything at all.
He nods, then sits forward, arms resting on the table we've been sitting
at for the last hour, idly chitchatting, avoiding the real nitty-gritty of things
until our stomachs were full. “All right. Let's tackle this together, then.
What's going on?”
So, I tell him.
I tell him all about how I've been carrying around this dark cloud of
uncertainty since the end of last season. All the bad shit that's happened. All
the pressure of it being a contract year. The way my teammates are looking
at me. I leave out Harper and how guilty I feel for lying to her.
When I'm finished, he doesn't speak for a long time, just watches me
with those perceptive eyes.
Then he laughs.
He fucking laughs.
“You'll have to excuse me if I don't find this funny.”
I glower at him and shove a fry into my mouth, annoyed by his reaction.
He doesn't care. He just keeps laughing.
He's lucky he's an amazing agent and has become a good friend over
the years.
When Shepard Clark knocked on my door, asking if I was represented, I
told him to fuck off. What the hell does a former pro-baseball star and
World Series champion want with a hockey player? Turned out, a lot.
He was honest from the get-go. He and his best friend started an agency,
and he wanted to step outside his comfort zone and push himself by getting
immersed in another world.
There was no bullshit with him. No trying to schmooze me. Straight and
to the point.
I liked him right away and signed a contract without hesitation.
Lucky for me, trusting my gut was the right thing to do. When I got
arrested and the news about my prior charge came out, he didn't even bat an
eye. He was just there, ready to help make it right. We've had a good, solid
relationship through the years.
But right now I kind of want to punch him.
“Sorry, sorry,” he finally says, then he clears his throat and shakes his
shoulders, taking a drink of the water sitting in front of him. “I'm good.”
“What's so fucking funny?”
“You!” He chuckles again, runs a hand through his hair. “Can't you see
that it's you?” He reaches over and flicks my temple. I swat at his hand.
“You're up there, not in the game like you need to be. You need to just
relax. Get laid. Get a massage. Meditate.”
“Not you too.” I groan, tossing my head back. “Fucking Rhodes keeps
saying the same shit.”
“And he's right.” He shrugs. “I've been in your position before, pissed
at the world because it's fucking you over. But athlete to athlete, if you're
not relaxed, you're not going to play well. It really is that simple.”
“Tell that to my brain. It won't shut off.”
“When's the last time it did? The last time you weren't completely
stressed to the max? The last time you let go and had fun?”
My mind drifts to Harper and that car ride we shared.
To Harper and our texts at night.
Talking to her is easy. Effortless. Every time a conversation between us
ends, I can't wait for another to begin.
“Oh.” Shep draws my attention his way. “Whatever—or whoever—it is
you're thinking about, do that…them. Your whole”—he waves a hand over
me—“everything just changed.” I scowl and he laughs, setting his water
down and flagging down our server. “Listen, Col, you know I want this
season to go well as much as you do. You deserve to hoist that Cup as much
as any other player.”
The server appears with our check in hand, and Shep slips them a black
card without even looking at the bill. He can afford it. I know what he
makes in commission from me alone, not to mention his other clients.
“But if you don't get out of your own way, it's not going to happen,” he
finishes once the server disappears again.
I let out a long sigh because somewhere deep down, I know he's
probably right.
This means Rhodes is right too—not that I'd tell the asshole.
But it's not as easy as they make it sound.
Every time I'm out on the ice—the place that was once my haven—all I
see are the disappointed faces of my teammates. All I hear is the deafening
silence of when the call that sealed our fate was made.
Usually when you think hockey arena, you think boisterous, cheering
fans.
But most people forget about the quiet moments. The ones where
everyone collectively holds their breaths.
The ones where the game of inches and seconds really becomes a game
of centimeters and milliseconds.
I remember them.
I remember them all too well.
“The Comets love you,” he says like he can read my thoughts. “The
fans love you. Your coaches, the staff, teammates—they all want to see you
stay here as much as you want to stay. But…”
My gut sinks, already knowing where this is going.
“If you don't step aside and let your hockey sense take over, given
your…history…we should probably start talking about the real possibility
of playing somewhere else next year.”
His words fall around us like a heavy curtain.
I want to stay with the Comets. As much as I love my parents and miss
them, this is home now. I know there are no guarantees in hockey, but if I
had a chance to work hard and make it happen, I'd stay.
The server drops off the tab, and Shep signs the receipt, then snaps the
book closed with finality.
“I was hoping to stay and chat some more, but I gotta get back to the
wife.”
His wife, Denver, is a journalist and always keeps her ear to the ground
about anything ready to blow up concerning Shep's athletes. I knew the
press had dug into my past before they even aired the story thanks to her.
“Never have kids, man,” he says, standing. I follow his lead, gulping
down the rest of my water, then grabbing my discarded ball cap and pulling
it low over my head. I'm sure most people won't bother me in the
restaurant, but I still like to keep a low profile on the streets. “I swear they
never stop shitting.”
I laugh. “Trust me, much to my parents' dismay, I'm good on kids.”
“That's what my brother said too, and I guess he was right to an extent,
but those fucking goats of his are just as bad as having human children.”
He shakes his head as we make our way out of the restaurant.
I only get stopped once, which is a win for me.
“Look,” Shep says when we get outside, “just think about what I—” He
shakes his head. “You know what? No. Don't think. No thinking for a
change, just doing. Whatever feels good, do that.”
I nod.
“Good. Now go home and get some rest.” He claps me on the shoulder.
“I'll text you, okay?”
Another nod.
He spins on his heel, then turns right back around, snapping his fingers.
“Shit, I almost forgot. Home opener? Your parents coming?”
“Nah. They have some big fall festival thing to prepare for.”
“Mind if I get your seats? Denver bought some photographs from a
local photographer and fell in love with the gal. They won't stop gabbing
with each other. Figured we could hook her and a friend up with tickets to a
home game or something.”
“Of course,” I say. “They're all yours. I'll get it taken care of.”
“Thanks. Appreciate it.” Another slap to the shoulder as he backs away.
“Remember, just relax.”
I flip him off, and he laughs.
I head in the opposite direction, my apartment only a couple of blocks
away. I keep my head down as I make my way home, not wanting to be
bothered by anyone. At the beginning of my career, this always made me
feel like an asshole. I thought I had to be “on” for my fans at all times. But
the more I settle into the limelight, the better I am at creating boundaries.
“Good evening, sir,” Beau says, holding the door open for me as I
approach. “You look like you're deep in concentration. Anything I can do to
help?”
“Apparently I think too much. Think you can perform a lobotomy?”
“I once landed a plane in the water and survived floating in the ocean
for five days. I was a pilot, not a doctor, but I can give it my best shot.” He
leans in close. “For an Oatmeal Creme Pie, sir.”
I tuck my lips together at his answer. “I'm fresh out tonight. Rain check
on the pie and lobotomy?”
“You bet.” He sends me a wink as I step into the elevator. “Have a good
night, sir.”
“Good night, Beau. Say hi to Meghan for me.”
Once inside my apartment, I change into a pair of sweats, forgoing a
shirt, then grab a beer and settle onto the couch.
I'm physically tired, but my brain is nowhere near ready for bed. I know
if I lie down now, I'll just wait for hours with no sleep in sight.
When I turn on the TV, SportsCenter is pulled up and I click away fast.
I don't want to think about hockey tonight. I just want to watch something
mindless and not think.
I settle on a rerun of FRIENDS and grab my phone, scrolling the
internet with no real purpose.
Shep's words play in my mind over and over again.
Whatever feels good, do that.
No thinking, just doing.
I don't let myself overthink it as I navigate to the BeeMine app and
click on Harper's messages.
HockeyGuy69: So…
Dots dance on my screen almost instantly, and I grin.
HorrorHarper: Oh no. Nothing good ever starts with so.
HorrorHarper: You're breaking up with me, aren't you?
HockeyGuy69: Did I miss a step in our relationship?
HorrorHarper: Well, I don't mean BREAKING UP breaking up.
I mean like…you're gonna break the news that you've met
someone else and you're all in love and shit and we have to
stop messaging.
HorrorHarper: But because you're a total gentleman, you're
telling me.
HorrorHarper: At least I have you built up in my head as a
gentleman.
HorrorHarper: Are you a gentleman?
HockeyGuy69: Depends on the setting.
HorrorHarper: Oh. OH. *blushes*
HockeyGuy69: Also, I'm not messaging anyone else. Just so
we're clear.
HorrorHarper: Neither am I.
HockeyGuy69: Good. That's good.
HockeyGuy69: This is a good so, by the way. I think.
HorrorHarper: You sound totally confident about that.
HockeyGuy69: What can I say? I'm a confident guy.
HorrorHarper: *waits for bombshell*
HockeyGuy69: Go out with me.
10
HARPER
HockeyGuy69: Go out with me.
I throw my phone.
Like clean across the room, just give it a toss.
Because what. The. Fuck?!
My phone buzzes over where it landed, and I'm scared to pick it up.
This must be what people mean when they say their heart leaped into
their throat.
Because that's where mine is right now.
A…date?
Not that I haven't considered the possibility before. I mean, that's what
this whole thing is supposed to be leading to, right?
All of a sudden it just feels so real. Tangible.
Exciting.
Because I think I'd like a date with Wright.
I want to know if he's this funny and bold in real life. If he's this
charming.
I scramble across the room at the thought of seeing him all dressed up
and pluck my phone from the floor.
HockeyGuy69: Shit. I freaked you out, didn't I?
HorrorHarper: No.
HorrorHarper: Okay, fine. Maybe.
HockeyGuy69: I guess what I should have asked was… Are
you free next Saturday?
HorrorHarper: I'm always free on Saturdays.
HorrorHarper: Oh god. That makes it sound like I have no life.
I swear I have a wife.
HorrorHarper: Crap! I meant LIFE.
HorrorHarper: I have a LIFE. Not a wife. Though if Kate
Beckinsale came knocking at my door, I'm not entirely sure I'd
turn her down.
HockeyGuy69: No sane person would.
HockeyGuy69: Also, your panicked texting is so cute.
HorrorHarper: Ah. The dreaded “cute” word.
HockeyGuy69: Is it a bad thing to be cute?
HorrorHarper: Not entirely. It's just… Well, cute always seems
to be delegated to the best friend's tagalong little sister. Or the
friend who makes you laugh but doesn't make you…you
know…hard.
HorrorHarper: Like your penis. I'm talking about your penis
getting hard.
HockeyGuy69: Harper?
HockeyGuy69: I mean this with absolutely all the respect in
the world, but shut up.
HockeyGuy69: Women overthink shit way too much.
HockeyGuy69: Your rambling is cute because it means you
actually care about what I think of you. You're cute because
you're funny and quick-witted. Cute because you're
unapologetically into what you're into. Cute because you're
brave enough to put yourself out there for online dating.
HockeyGuy69: But, Harper? You're also fucking gorgeous,
and I'd be damn lucky if you said yes to going on a date with
me.
I read his messages over and over again with shaking hands and heated
cheeks.
I feel so silly getting flustered over the word cute, but when he spells it
all out like that…
HockeyGuy69: Did I scare you away?
HorrorHarper: No.
HockeyGuy69: No I didn't scare you or no to a date.
HorrorHarper: I'm not scared. Well, maybe a little. But I'm only
scared because I really want to say YES to next Saturday
but…I'm also worried.
HockeyGuy69: What's to worry about?
HorrorHarper: Well, you could totally murder me for starters.
I'm a horror movie lover. I am well versed in the dangers of
meeting strangers.
HockeyGuy69: I promise not to murder you.
HorrorHarper: Promise promise?
HockeyGuy69: Yes. I look really good in a suit as long as it's
not a jumpsuit.
HorrorHarper: Why did I just get visions of you looking all hot
in a Michael Myers jumpsuit?
HockeyGuy69: Because you're demented.
HockeyGuy69: Speaking of Michael…I thought your profile
specifically stated you were no Laurie Strode looking for her
Michael. A good time, not a long time.
HorrorHarper: True…
HockeyGuy69: Then come have a good time with me, Harper.
A date with Hockey Guy?
It's a bad idea. I just know it is.
I'm almost certain I'll be stood up or let down. That's usually how this
whole internet-dating thing goes.
But I can't stop myself from letting those thoughts of maybe creep in.
Maybe it won't be bad.
Maybe he'll be everything I hope he is.
Maybe even more.
Before I can talk myself out of it, I respond.
HorrorHarper: Yes.
“Okay, what the hell is going on? You've looked at your phone no less than
six times in the last ten minutes. This is supposed to be our time,
remember?”
My cheeks flush under Ryan's watchful gaze.
Of course she'd pick up on that.
I don't want to be that glued-to-the-phone type of girl, but I haven't
heard from him tonight and it's way past the time when he usually texts.
Did he realize he made a mistake? Was this all a game? Is he ghosting
me?
Ryan gasps, slapping at the table. “Oh my gosh. Puh-lease tell me you
met someone on that app and you've been a really bad friend by holding out
on me?”
Her eyes are bright and shiny and all kinds of excited as she wiggles her
fingers.
I don't want to lie to her, but I also kind of don't want to share Hockey
Guy with her just yet.
But Ryan being Ryan, she knows the truth before I can even say
anything.
“You are! You're totally holding out on me! Who is he? I want to see!”
She reaches for my phone, but I pull it out of the way just in time. She
pushes her lip out and crosses her arms over her chest, pouting. “You suck.”
“These are our private messages, you nosy brat.”
“Wait a minute…” She sits forward like it hits her all at once. “Harper
Dolores, have you gone out on a date with this person?”
“No.”
She narrows her eyes. “Why does that feel like a loaded answer?”
I shrink back from her piercing dark green gaze.
Not much scares me, but Ryan?
Terrifies the crap out of me.
“Because it's missing the words ‘not yet,'” I mumble, taking a sip of my
frozen daiquiri to avoid looking at her, waiting for her reaction.
“You…you have a date and you didn't tell me?”
She sounds…hurt.
And I didn't mean to hurt her.
“Yes. But the only reason I didn't say anything is because I didn't want
to jinx it. We've been talking every night, and things have been going well.
He asked me out.”
“Shut up. When?”
“For Saturday.”
“Saturday Saturday? Like three days from now?” I nod, and she squeals
with delight. “Oh my gosh. I'm so excited for you!”
“Me too.”
It's true. Even though our texts have been brief since he asked me out,
there is something low in my gut telling me I can trust him.
It's that same feeling I had when I let Collin into my car.
My mind begins to drift to the stranger again, but I don't let it get far. I
shouldn't be thinking of him still, not really. He was nobody. Just a fun
story to tell people. That's all.
“So we've given up on Hot Hitchhiker, then?” Ryan asks like she knows
I'm thinking about him.
I lift my eyes skyward. “We were never ‘on' Hot Hitchhiker. You were
the one obsessed with him.”
“Uh-huh. Says the girl who blushed the entire time she talked about
him.” She takes a sip of her cocktail, lifting a pointed brow my way.
“Anyway, let's see our new boyfriend. Is he hot?”
I click on his profile and read it to her, letting her take a peek at the few
photos he has. The same photos I've spent way too long staring at.
“Holy shit. Are those real?” She squints, leaning closer. “Because good
lord. I swear I could wash my laundry on those bad boys. Specifically my
panties.”
“Ryan!”
“What? I'd wash yours too. How come there are no pictures of his
face?”
I shrug. “I don't know. A lot of profiles are like that though.”
“Doesn't that worry you?”
“Not really.”
“Hockey Guy, huh?” she asks, still staring down at his abs. “But you
hate sports. What's with you attracting dudes who like sports recently?”
“I know.” I wrinkle my nose, setting my phone aside. “It's his one flaw.
But we've clicked on other stuff, so I'm choosing to ignore that little
passion of his.”
“Does he play or just a fan?”
I snort. “Right, because a hockey player needs to get on some dating
app to get a girl to date him.”
“Hey, you never know. I saw a movie once where—”
“Ryan, we've talked about mixing up fairy tales and real life before.”
She sticks her tongue out at my teasing. “Fine. Either way, I'm just glad
you are finally going to go out with someone. It's been ages since you
have.”
“It hasn't been ages. Just…” I think back to the last time I did go on a
date. Oh crap. “It's been like a year,” I whisper.
She laughs. “Yeah, like I said, ages. You've been cooped up in your
apartment being a badass girl boss and I think that's great, but you haven't
been paying attention to your other needs.” Her brows bounce up and down.
“If you catch my drift.”
“I take plenty care of myself, thank you very much.”
“Sure, the vibe is great, but we both know the real thing is better.”
“My vibrator always makes sure I come first.”
She groans. “Ugh. That is the worst. They either rail into you like
they're humping a couch or they can't find your clit. Um, sir, it is literally
right there!”
“What? You mean it's not the fat roll on my thigh?”
“Does that feel good, baby?” she mocks in a deep voice. “I don't know,
Brad. Does it feel good when I lick your belly button instead of your dick?
Because that's about how far you are from my clit right now.”
We fall into a fit of giggles, several people staring at us. I can't tell if it's
our loud laughter or if it's Ryan they're all staring at, no doubt recognizing
her from social media. That tends to happen often when we go out.
“We should date better men,” Ryan says, composing herself. She tips
her drink toward me. “Here's hoping your Hockey Guy takes care of all
your needs.”
“Ryan! I'm not going to sleep with him on the first date!”
“Hello, have you seen his abs? Maybe you need to look again.” She
reaches for my phone again and I snatch it away. “Boo!”
“You know what? Maybe you should find someone to date. You're
clearly horny.”
“I'm, uh, actually seeing Steven again tomorrow night at my showing,”
she says quietly. “You're still coming, right?”
Ugh. Steven.
He's a piece of work, and I don't understand what Ryan sees in him.
He's an artsy type who is a little too heavy into the whole moody artist
trope. To be frank, he's a dick, and Ryan deserves better.
“You know I'll be there. I can't wait to see Steven again.” And punch
him right in the taint.
Knowing my distaste for him, she laughs off my words, but I see the
uncertainty in her own eyes.
“Anyway,” she says, tossing her hair over her shoulder and resting her
arms against the table. “I know how you can make it up to me.”
“Make what up to you?”
“Not telling me about your absolute”—she winks at her own joke
—“hockey hottie.”
“I told you, it was because—”
“You didn't want to jinx it, didn't know if it was going to be a thing…
yeah, yeah.” She waves off my excuses. “Just let me guilt-trip you, okay?”
“I don't think you're supposed to tell me you're guilt-tripping me.”
“I got some tickets…”
“No!” I hold my hand up, shaking my head. “Nope. I know where this is
going already.”
“Come on, Harper, please!” She folds her hands together. “Please!
You're my best friend in the whole wide world and I want to experience my
first ever live hockey game with you.”
“Where did you even get tickets to a hockey game? Are you even a
hockey fan?”
“I like the butts.”
Okay, that's fair.
“And remember those photographs I sold to that former pro-baseball
player? I guess he's some sort of hotshot sports agent now and had some
tickets to spare. I wasn't about to say no.” She bats her lashes at me.
“Please, Harper, please. It's this Friday and I really want to go.”
“I hate sports. You know that.”
“I do know that. But you know I hate when you hide things from me,
and well”—she waves her hand across the table, sitting back in her chair
with confidence—“look at us now.”
Dammit.
“That's a low blow.”
She lifts a shoulder. “Told you I'd guilt-trip you.”
She did. She warned me.
“Fine,” I say through gritted teeth. “Fine. But I plan to complain the
entire time.”
She grins triumphantly. “I would expect nothing less.”
“Oh god.”
A low moan escapes my lips, and I don't even care.
I pull my other shoe off and another moan slips free as I sink my toes
into the soft rug, loving the feel under my aching feet. I'm not used to
wearing real shoes for more than a quick errand, and I am definitely not
used to wearing heels.
Ryan had a small showing at a gallery downtown, so I was peopling for
the past four hours, which is way too long for me. I'm going to have to do
the same thing tomorrow at the hockey game I'm being forced to attend.
I'm beat. And starving. The hors d'oeuvres they were serving were way
too tiny.
I need food and a bed—in that order.
I make my way to my bedroom and don't feel an ounce of shame when
I moan the moment my boobs fall out of my bra. I swap my jeans for
pajama shorts and my silky blouse for an oversized shirt that has roughly
twenty holes in it.
I'm scrubbing off the minimal amount of makeup I wore tonight when
my phone buzzes against the counter.
I hurry to check it, hoping it's Wright and feeling like a fiend looking
for my next thrill.
HockeyGuy69: Say I'm on the hunt for something tasty and
need a pick-me-up in the morning. What's the best coffee
shop in the city?
HorrorHarper: Mine.
HockeyGuy69: You own a coffee shop?
HorrorHarper: No. I make my own coffee.
HockeyGuy69: So let me get this straight—I ask for
something tasty and you invite me over?
HockeyGuy69: Because if that's the case, the answer is yes.
I chuckle. Of course that's where he goes.
HorrorHarper: Slow your roll there, Mr. Romance.
HockeyGuy69: I'm sensing sarcasm regarding the name.
HorrorHarper: You've sensed right.
HorrorHarper: As for coffee, I have a whole coffee bar in my
apartment and everything. Though Jennie's Java isn't too bad
if you're in a pinch.
HockeyGuy69: A coffee bar? Like a booze bar but for coffee?
I head into my kitchen, snap a quick picture of my setup, and send it to him.
While I wait for his response, I rifle through my cabinets for food, but
there's next to nothing in them and what I do have doesn't sound good at
all.
I place an order for a sub from my favorite place just a few miles away,
then grab a glass of wine and settle onto the couch while I wait.
HockeyGuy69: How Pinterest of you.
HorrorHarper: Don't poke fun. It's genius! I save SO much
money doing it this way.
HockeyGuy69: I've always thought coffee was equivalent to
sandwiches or salads—they always taste better when
someone else makes them.
HorrorHarper: Sure. If you don't know what you're doing.
HockeyGuy69: I feel like you've just insulted my cooking
abilities.
HorrorHarper: Sandwiches and salads don't count as cooking.
HockeyGuy69: That's fair. And to be honest, I don't really
cook much anyway.
HorrorHarper: But you can cook, right? You just choose not
to? Because a guy who can cook…wowza. *fans self*
HockeyGuy69: Cooking turns you on, huh?
HorrorHarper: Very much so.
HockeyGuy69: *signs up for cooking lessons*
HockeyGuy69: Honestly, though, sometimes my schedule
doesn't afford me much time to mess around in the kitchen,
so I often opt for takeout or prepared meals from the
nutritionist.
HorrorHarper: Is “nutritionist” a code word for mom?
HockeyGuy69: I just spit out my beer and now all my buddies
are looking at me weird.
HorrorHarper: You're out with friends right now?
HockeyGuy69: Unfortunately. I'd rather be at home, but I also
kind of need to be here. It's a work thing.
HockeyGuy69: And no, I actually mean my nutritionist.
HorrorHarper: *whistles* Someone's fancy.
HockeyGuy69: Eh. Perks of the job.
HorrorHarper: I guess working in sports you would have
access to things like that.
HorrorHarper: And no, that is not an invitation to start talking
sports. I refuse to like them.
HockeyGuy69: We'll see about that.
HorrorHarper: Might as well quit while you're ahead. It's not
going to happen.
HockeyGuy69: I can be very persuasive, you know.
HorrorHarper: Oh, I don't doubt that for a second.
HorrorHarper: Even though you don't show your face in your
profile pictures, I'm willing to bet you have a stupid dimple in
your stupid face and it gets you all the stupid things you want.
HockeyGuy69: Would you like some fries to go with that salt?
HorrorHarper: YES!
HorrorHarper: But only because I'm hungry and haven't had
dinner yet.
HockeyGuy69: It's like 9 PM! That is way past nom-noms
time.
HorrorHarper: Agreed. And if I don't get some nom-noms
soon, I may rage.
HorrorHarper: I ordered some delivery.
HockeyGuy69: Please do not hurt the delivery person. I don't
want to have to go to court and testify against you. I mean,
like I said, I look really good in a suit, so I'd do it, but please
don't make me.
HorrorHarper: You'd testify against me just to prove to
everyone how good you look in a suit?
HockeyGuy69: 100%
Dots dance across the screen, then disappear.
It happens again.
Then again.
Hmm.
I set my phone aside, giving him time to figure out what he's clearly
struggling to say. I give my attention to the TV I've had on for background
noise.
I wish I could say that by the time the delivery person rings the bell and
I buzz them up, pay, and then settle back down with my food, I've forgotten
all about the dancing dots.
But I haven't.
Finally, when I'm halfway through my dinner, my phone buzzes again.
HockeyGuy69: I'm sorry I've been a little MIA lately.
HockeyGuy69: I don't want to give the lame excuse of work
but…work. The hours kind of suck sometimes.
I trust his words, but something is telling me it's not the whole story.
I deserve the whole story.
HockeyGuy69: I'm sure you're asleep by now, but I just
wanted you to know that.
HockeyGuy69: Good night, Harper.
I don't text him back.

COLLIN
Turns out not thinking is really stupid.
Like monumentally dumb.
We have our first home game tonight and we're supposed to be
preparing for it, but I can't focus.
All I can think about is how I'm going to explain to Harper who the hell
I am.
On our date.
Date.
The one I asked her out on tomorrow night.
Stupid, stupid, stupid.
This app thing was supposed to help me find someone to relax with, not
cause me more stress.
What the fuck have I gotten myself into?
“Pull your fucking head out of your ass, Wright!” Colter's voice cuts
through my thoughts, and I glower over at the prick. “This season isn't all
about you, Golden Boy.”
Golden Boy? Not even close.
“Fuck off, Colter.”
“I should fuck off?” He skates to a stop right in front of me, getting into
my face. “How about you fuck off. You're the one dragging the team
down.”
“We've only lost one game.”
Our first three games of the season have been away games, leaving us
without the home-ice advantage, and the one game we lost went to
overtime, so we still got a point. We're not exactly struggling out here.
“Yeah, no thanks to your shit playing.”
I grit my teeth, trying not to let it show how much his words get to me.
That's the funny thing about hockey—your team can be winning game
after game, but you can still be struggling. Dropped passes, shots missing
the net by a mile, being outskated.
That's where I am right now. We're winning, but everyone else might as
well be playing a different game than me. I'm screwing up basic things, and
people are beginning to take notice. We can't keep this up all season,
winning games by just a point, almost letting the other team score on simple
mistakes.
I know it and everyone else knows it too. Playing like this isn't going to
get me a contract extension, not by a long shot.
Colter inches closer, our noses nearly touching. “The only reason we
won was because your ugly buddy Rhodes pulled your ass out of trouble.
Scared Boston away with that ugly fucking scar of his.”
“Fuck. Off.” I growl again, my patience with the asshole wearing thin.
“Or what? Gonna have Rhodes come fight your battle for you again?”
His lips pull into an ugly smile. “You don't have the fucking balls to hit me.
You're weak, Wright. And if the captain wasn't so in love with you and
didn't convince Coach you're worth the ice time, we both know I'd have
your minutes in a heartbeat.”
Ah. So that's what this is about.
He's jealous.
Which, given my piss-poor playing lately, is comical.
Rhodes skates closer in my periphery, and I shake my head at him,
keeping him back.
This isn't his battle. It's mine.
I step toward my teammate. “Even at your absolute best, you couldn't
handle the extra minutes.”
And it's true. Colter is a selfish player, and that's what's holding him
back. I might be shit right now, but he couldn't cut it. He'd be too busy
trying to make fancy plays and costing us precious inches.
I might not be perfect out there, but I have years of experience and
patience.
He shoves at me. “Fuck you, Wright.”
I let him have that shove because I deserve it.
But he won't get another.
“You think you're untouchable, think your spot can't easily be filled.
You're wrong.”
Another shove, and I break.
The gloves come off, and I hear his nose crack under my fist. He
stumbles backward, then charges me again, getting my jaw good. The
unique metallic flavor hits me all at once.
I run my tongue over my teeth and grin at him.
I like this.
Shit, maybe I even needed this.
Colter goes for another blow and misses. He pulls at my sweater, trying
to yank it over my head, but I'm bigger than him and easily wrench myself
away, landing another hit to his jaw.
Around and around we go. Back and forth, swinging in circles now,
matching each other blow for blow.
Nobody around us moves until we hit the ice, then suddenly they're all
pulling at us.
Rhodes grabs under my arms, hauling me up and off Colter, who
scrambles to get out of Miller's grasp to reach for me again.
“Enough!” Lowell yells, a hand on each of our chests, shoving us away
from one another. “Fucking enough. Cool off.”
Miller tries to drag Colter away, and he shoves at him—which pisses me
off all over again—then skates toward the dressing room.
We all hear the doors slam as he makes his way down the tunnel.
Lowell looks over at me. “You good?” I nod. “Good. Don't pull that shit
again.” When he's skating past me, he mutters, “Been wanting to do that
since day one.”
The laugh that's on my lips is cut short when I catch Coach's eye from
across the ice.
He's not happy.
Not fucking happy at all.
Awesome.
Colter doesn't come back—which doesn't matter to me—and the rest of
the morning is uneventful.
We're in the dressing room when Rhodes flops down onto the bench
next to me.
“All right. Spill it.”
“What are you talking about?”
He presses a hard finger into the pinched skin between my eyebrows.
“I'm talking about that shit. I'm supposed to be the broody one.”
I smack his hand away. “Piss off.”
“Not until you tell me what's going on.”
“It's nothing.”
He's quiet for a moment, and I think he's going to let it go.
But he's Rhodes, so of course he's not.
Instead, he leans down, tipping his head toward mine, and speaks low.
“We have a game tonight, you know. So you better start talking before your
head is so far up your own ass that we lose and your contract with the
Comets turns to ashes right in front of you.”
Shit.
He's right, and I hate that he's right.
I gnash my teeth, trying to rein in my frustration.
“Fine.”
I tell him about Harper. How we met…then met again. How I left out
some minor details like the fact that I play professional hockey. How I
haven't told her that HockeyGuy69 is also the guy she played an awful
game of nighttime “I spy” with.
When I'm finished, he just stares at me, mouth slackened, eyes wide.
“Are you…are you like extra dumb or something? Concussed?” He
places his hand against my forehead. “Are you sick?”
I swat him away again. “I'm fine.”
“If you're pulling shit like this, clearly you're not. What the hell, man?
Why?”
“I don't know. I just…fuck!” I run a hand through my sweaty hair.
“She's not into sports and doesn't have a clue who I am. Doesn't care at
all.” I shrug. “It's nice to not worry about all that for a change.”
Rhodes shakes his head. “I hate how that actually makes sense to me.”
“See? I'm not completely nuts.”
“No. You are. What the hell were you going to tell her when you met
her, huh? Just hoped she'd laugh it off and you two would bone and that'd
be it?”
I clench my fists at the thought of that being it.
“I was hoping she'd understand, yes.”
“You know the likelihood of that is almost nonexistent, right? Are you
really sure this is what you want to do? It's not too late to back out. You
haven't gone on the date yet.”
“I'm not going to ghost her like some asshole.”
“You have no problem lying to her like one.”
Another squeeze of my fists.
“Face it—you're fucked.”
“You think I don't know that?” I huff out a derisive laugh. “If this was
supposed to be some pep talk, you suck.”
“Yeah, well, I didn't think you'd tell me this shit. I just figured it was
Colter being a cock again or that look Coach gave you after the fight.” He
crosses his arms over his chest, leaning back against his cubby. “Damn,
dude. No wonder you're playing like shit, missing easy passes and not
having your head in the game. You're all messed up from this.”
We sit in silence for a few minutes, a few straggling teammates
shuffling about.
I don't know why I asked Harper out, like shit isn't complicated enough
already.
Okay, that's a lie.
I know exactly why I did it—I like her. Probably a lot more than I'm
allowing myself to admit.
But I could have found a better way for her to find out it's me. I could
have just been honest from the beginning too, but it's too late for that.
Now I have to figure out how the hell I'm going to fix it all.
If this were any other chick, some random hookup, it wouldn't be a big
deal because it wouldn't mean anything.
But Harper…she means something.
“You know you have to tell her before your date, right?”
“I know.”
“She's gonna flip.”
“I know.”
“You're an idiot.”
“I know.”
“I—”
“You're not helping,” I cut him off, glaring. “I'll tell her, okay? I'll
fucking tell her.”
“When?”
It's a simple word, but the meaning behind it is anything but.
What he really means is before tonight.
He wants me at the game with a clear conscience.
I need to be at the game with a clear conscience.
“I'll tell her,” I promise quietly.
“Good.”
There's nothing like playing in front of a home crowd. There's a buzz in
your veins and in the air.
Tonight, mine is buzzing for a different reason.
I head for the dressing room, trying to block everything out.
Several heads swivel my way, probably because of my busted lip and
the bruise on my jaw after the fight with Colter this morning.
I keep my head down as I change out of my suit into some shorts and a
t-shirt, then pop my earbuds in and settle onto the couch we have in the
lounge. I pull my phone from my pocket and turn on a random '90s playlist
to try to relax.
My eyes drift toward the BeeMine app.
I tried several times to message Harper earlier, but everything I typed
out sounded horrible.
There is no doubt she's going to be pissed. She may never forgive me or
talk to me again.
And I'd deserve that one hundred percent.
But Rhodes was right. I need to tell her.
If I don't, it's all I'm going to be thinking about tonight, and I cannot be
thinking about that tonight.
If that fight with Colter this morning taught me anything, it's that I can't
keep screwing up.
I want to be better than that. Better than him.
I click on the app and pull up my messages with Harper.
HockeyGuy69: There's something I need to tell you.
HockeyGuy69: It's probably going to piss you off, but I have to
clear the air.
HockeyGuy69: I'm Collin.
HockeyGuy69: Collin Wright. And I play for the NHL.

HARPER
HockeyGuy69: There's something I need to tell you.
A pit forms in my stomach as I read his words.
We didn't talk last night and I've tried hard all day to not think much
about it, but I won't lie—it's been eating at me.
Ever since he asked me out, something has seemed…off.
I don't know if it's nerves or if he's actually just busy with work, but it's
off nonetheless.
Another message comes through.
HockeyGuy69: It's probably going to piss you off, but I have to
clear the air.
Oh crap, here it comes.
“Nope!” Ryan steals my phone away just as it vibrates again. She slips
it into the abyss known as her purse as we make our way down the arena
stairs to our seats. “That's mine for the night. No more pining over Hockey
Hottie. Tonight is girls' night.”
I should protest. Should tell her that's a stupid rule.
But I can't bring myself to say it because I'm not so sure I want to hear
what he has to say.
Does he want to bail on the date? Has he been catfishing me all along? I
mean, he's seemed too good to be true from day one, so I wouldn't be
entirely surprised.
“Here we are,” Ryan says, scooting down the aisle. She claps her hands,
bouncing up and down with excitement. “Holy shit. These seats are
amazing!”
I want to point out that since she's never been to a hockey game before,
she doesn't know if these seats actually are good.
But considering we're just three rows back from the glass, I'd say her
assumption is correct.
Ryan forced us to arrive nearly an hour before puck drop. She claimed
she wanted to make sure we got to our seats okay, but I know she just didn't
want to miss warmups.
She also promised snacks if I agreed to it.
“So when do we get to the good part?”
“Well, apparently they do warmups and then there's a bit of a break and
—” She pauses, then snorts out a laugh when she catches my bored
expression. “Oh. You meant food.”
“You promised popcorn. Nachos too.”
“And alcohol.”
“All the alcohol.”
She chuckles. “All right. I'll be right back. But no nachos until later.”
“Because that's the only way you're going to get me to stay the entire
game?”
A grin. “You know me so well.”
She takes off for the food, leaving me sitting there with nothing to do
since my phone is in her purse.
Spectators begin to file in around me. A woman sits a few seats down,
and I can hear her on the phone talking about something to do with goats.
There's nobody in the two rows in front of us yet.
I still can't believe we're sitting this close to the ice. I once went to a
football game with my dad and we were so far from the field you could
barely make out the players. Here…it's going to be like I can reach out and
touch them.
And it's chilly too.
I pull my cardigan closed a little more, shivering a bit at the nip in the
air.
“First time?” the woman asks, drawing my attention.
“How'd you know?”
She nods toward where I have my arms crossed over me. “I was the
same way my first game. But you get used to it.”
“I really didn't think I'd be this chilly, but I should have known. I'm a
wimp when it comes to the cold.”
She laughs. “Me too. It'll warm up once more bodies get in here, but not
enough to take your cardi off.”
A shadow falls over her and a beer appears in front of her face. She
grins at the tall guy with ink-black hair and black-framed glasses who takes
the seat next to her. He's wearing a shirt that says “G.O.A.T. Dad” with a
picture of him and several tiny goats. I'm not usually into the whole nerdvibe thing he has going, but this guy is…wow.
She takes the drink from his outstretched hand, then tips the cup my
way. “Plus, the alcohol helps. I'm Delia, by the way.” She gestures toward
the guy beside her. “This is my husband, Zach. Please ignore his
embarrassing shirt. He wouldn't take it off.”
He leans around her and sends me a grin. “She's always trying to get me
naked.”
She swats at him. “Zachary!”
I laugh. “I'm Harper. It's nice to meet you both.”
“Are you here for the Comets or the Caps? I assume Comets since
you're in season ticket seats.”
“Uh, Comets. I'm just here for the snacks mostly.”
They laugh like I'm joking.
I'm not.
“Oh my gosh,” Ryan says, dropping back down into the seat next to me.
“You should have seen the lines out there. It was like all of a sudden people
came from nowhere. I'm so glad we got here when we did. I heard someone
in line say that warmups start—”
The players come barreling onto the ice.
“Well, right now, I guess.”
She does another little clap, watching as they move across the rink.
They look…kind of beautiful if I'm being honest.
The way they move is breathtaking. It's smooth, like they're gliding on
air.
She hands me a few napkins. “Here. For your drool. And the popcorn.”
I scowl at her. “I'm not drooling.”
“Sure you're not.” She winks, then hands me a beer. “These were free,
by the way.”
“Ryan, did you flirt your way into getting free drinks?”
“Of course I did. Have you seen the prices here?” She shrugs, turns
around, and waves at a guy sitting a few rows up. “Plus he was cute,” she
says, turning back my way with a flirty grin.
I shake my head at her, then return my gaze to the ice.
A few Comets players are skating around in circles on one half. A few
are doing some sort of stretch that makes them look like they're humping
the ground, and a few…
A body slams into the glass, causing me to jump, spilling beer down my
secondhand Aerosmith t-shirt and the cardigan I'm wearing.
“Son of a…” I shoot up from my seat, cold, sticky liquid clinging to me.
“Oh, crap!” Ryan grabs a handful of napkins and starts patting at my
shirt. “Dammit. I love this shirt too. I—”
There's a tap on the glass that pulls our attention.
One of the players—who has a mean, jagged scar across his face—
mouths Sorry to us. He taps his buddy on the shoulder, pulling his attention
our way.
The moment our eyes collide, I freeze.
He gapes at me, his eyes—which I can now see are a clear green—wide
with shock.
“Collin?”
“Wait, like Hot Hitchhiker Collin?” Ryan asks.
I don't answer her. I'm too busy staring at the guy I never thought I'd
see again.
His friend says something quietly to him, and Collin nods without
looking over. He can't seem to take his eyes off me either.
We're locked in a trance, unable to move.
Then someone calls his name from across the ice, and just like that, it's
broken.
He turns and I gasp.
Wright.
It's there, stitched clear as day on the back of his jersey, along with the
number 96.
I actually meant to type in 96, but I guess we'll call it a happy accident.
He nods at whoever spoke to him, then turns back to me. He takes a step
closer and his teammate pulls at his arm, trying to drag him away.
Even from here, I can see that his eyes are full of so many emotions—
shock, worry, regret.
Another tug from his teammate, and this time Collin allows himself to
be pulled away.
He looks back at me three times on his way to the other side of the ice,
and each time it feels like a punch to the stomach.
Then he disappears down a tunnel and I'm left standing here feeling like
a complete fool.
“Give me my phone,” I say to Ryan, finding my voice once he's gone.
She reaches into her purse without question and hands it over.
I hold my breath as I click on the notification from the BeeMine app,
hoping this is all some sort of sick coincidence.
It's not.
It's right there, his confession.
This is what he wanted to talk about.
HockeyGuy69: I'm Collin.
HockeyGuy69: Collin Wright. And I play for the NHL.
“Holy shit.” I exhale heavily.
“What? Is that really Hot Hitchhiker?”
“Ryan…” I shove the phone in her face. “It's Hot Hockey Guy too.”
“What? No it's not.” She grabs the phone from my hands as I drop back
down into my seat. Her jaw drops when she reads his text. “Oh my god.
It's…”
“Yeah.”
“Holy shit.”
“Yeah.”
“This is…wow.”
She sits beside me, scrolling through our messages. I don't even care
enough at this point to stop her. It doesn't matter anymore. Our whole
relationship is a lie anyway.
“I can't believe this. You had no idea?”
“No! I don't sport. I couldn't tell you the first thing about hockey. I
thought the puck was made of plastic.”
“It's rubber,” Ryan corrects. “Everyone knows that.”
“I didn't! That's how much I don't sport!”
She tucks her lips together, trying not to laugh.
But it doesn't work. She bursts into a fit of giggles, and before I know
it, I'm joining her.
I'm almost certain people are staring at us, but I don't care.
It feels good to laugh, and if I don't laugh, I might cry.
My hitchhiker is my hockey guy.
His name is Collin Wright, and he plays for the NHL.
What the hell am I supposed to do with that?
“Do you want to go?” Ryan asks during the break between the first and
second period.
Part of me wanted to leave the moment I saw Collin on the ice.
But there's another part of me that can't seem to walk away now.
He was right—seeing the game live is so much better than seeing it on
TV.
There's something exhilarating about hearing the bodies crash against
the boards. Something so thrilling about hearing the puck ping off the
crossbar. And watching the players glide down the ice effortlessly like they
aren't playing a high-speed game on frozen water with knives attached to
their feet? It's intoxicating.
Too bad it's all being overshadowed by the fact that Collin lied to me.
Twice.
Sports industry.
That's what he told me, and he said it twice.
Really, I should have realized it then.
But if not then, I should have seen the other hints too. I spent the time
before puck drop scrolling back through all our messages, picking them
apart.
Wright lobbied for Freddy Krueger, just like Collin did.
He's twenty-seven, just like Collin.
Hell, he even tried to convince me to like sports, just like Collin.
And even though he admitted he was a hockey fan, he skirted around
the topic often enough that I should have picked up on him trying to hide
something.
I'm so embarrassed.
He must have thought it was hilarious, pretending to be a different
person. Pretending we didn't meet before. Pretending I didn't hold his
fucking sauce as he dunked his chicken nuggets.
That's the part that hurts the most I think. He knew it was me. It's not
like I hid my name or my identity behind faceless photos. I was upfront
from the beginning. He never was.
And yeah, okay…I understand it to an extent. He's a professional
athlete who is likely making millions of dollars a year. He's going to want
to be a bit private.
But it's me.
I don't care about his status. I just like him.
Liked, I remind myself.
Past tense.
“No,” I tell Ryan. “We can stay.”
“Are you sure?” She's trapped her lip between her teeth, her brows
drawn tightly together as she studies me closely.
“I'm sure. But I could definitely use more alcohol.”
“Want me to go?”
I shake my head. “No, I got it. I could use the fresh air.”
She nods and lets me out of the aisle.
I squeeze past several fans, taking note of the number of people wearing
WRIGHT on their backs. A few of them look at me and I swear I feel their
judgment, like they know and agree with how dumb I am for not putting
two and two together before.
The line for booze is long, and I don't make it back until right before the
start of the second period.
“You totally missed the little kiddos sliding around on the ice,” Ryan
says as I hand her one of the three beers I got. “I guess they're called Mites
or something. Anyway, they were so adorable.”
She doesn't comment on the extra beer like the good friend she is.
What she does say is “I'm sorry.”
“For what?”
“For pushing you to get on that app. If you hadn't, maybe you wouldn't
be feeling like you are now.”
Leave it to Ryan to not miss a thing.
“I feel like a fool,” I say quietly.
“I know. But you're not the fool—he is. He's the one who tricked you.”
“Yeah, but if I had just paid a bit more attention, maybe I could have
connected the dots.”
“Like you said, you don't sport.” She grins at the words. “How are you
supposed to know anything about something you don't follow? That would
be like me trying to piece together anything about horror movies. Not my
pig, not my farm, you know.”
I suppose she's right.
The announcer says something over the intercom and the crowd goes
wild, cheering loudly as the players make their way onto the ice.
The game starts again, twenty minutes on the clock.
Collin's out there, staying back by the blue line that's not too far from
where we're seated.
The way he moves…it's incredible. I have no idea how I missed him
being an athlete before. There's such focus and precision in every move he
makes.
His brows are drawn together in concentration as he watches the puck
move from stick to stick, his mouth pulled into a thin line. He's completely
focused on the game, and it's riveting to watch. I have no idea how he's
drowning out the noise of the crowd, but it's like we're not even here.
He gets the puck, then sends it sailing over to the other side of the ice,
to the guy with the scar on his lip.
Rhodes, his jersey reads, with a big number 6 right below it.
His partner sends the puck right back, and Collin shoots.
The crowd erupts around us as the red light ignites.
He scored!
Everyone is jumping up and down, the sound deafening. We get on our
feet too, pumping our fists in the air.
Collin's back hits the glass as his teammates crowd around him, patting
his back, bumping his fists.
They're right by us, several people beating on the glass with zeal.
It's all so…electrifying.
Just as Collin's about to skate away, he turns…and looks directly at me.
Then winks.
I swear I melt into my seat.
The Comets win 4-2, and though Collin doesn't score again, he earns what I
learn is called an assist.
The arena is buzzing with excitement, and fans are thrilled to have seen
Collin score. I heard a few people talking about how the team lost the
Stanley Cup last year and saying it was Collin's fault, so they're glad to see
him making a comeback.
I also thought I heard the word arrest mentioned, but I'm sure I'm
mistaken about that.
“Okay, it's official: I'm a hockey fan,” Ryan says, staring out at the ice
longingly as the players leave it.
“Are you a hockey fan, or do you just like looking at the hockey
players?”
“Yes.” She sighs dreamily. “Like, I'm not going to lie, I am totally
horny right now.”
I wouldn't admit it, but same.
And it's not even about the players.
It's everything about the game. The speed, the buzz, the power they
exude. It's all just so…hot.
“Come on, let's go stand up next to the glass.”
She grabs my hand, dragging me down the few rows before I can
protest. A couple of other people are down there too, clapping and cheering
still, and she wedges us in between them so we can see.
“Ladies and gentlemen, your three stars of the game!” the announcer
calls in that exaggerated voice all announcers have. “For our third star, with
the first goal of the game, we have number 13, Grady Miller!”
There are whistles and shouts of joy as the player takes the ice, makes a
circle, and then disappears again, but not before handing his stick off to a
kid hanging over the railings.
“For our second star of the night, with the game-winning goal, we have
number 6, Adrian Rhodes!”
The crowd cheers as Collin's partner skates back out onto the ice, lifting
his stick and making a short circle before heading back off. He also gives
his stick to a young fan.
“And our first star of the game, coming off a tough season last year but
more than making up for it with a goal and an assist, we have number 96,
Collin Wright!”
Everyone is on their feet as Collin skates back out. He does a few quick
circles, then hands his stick to someone standing over by the tunnel. He
leans in to talk to the person, pointing in the direction where we're standing.
Alarm bells begin to sound in my head and I pull at Ryan, trying to get
her to leave with me.
“No,” she says, dragging me back down. “Definite no.”
“Ryan, come on.”
“Shh! He's gonna talk.”
She points up at the jumbotron. The camera is focused on Collin as he
slides onto a bench, sitting beside some guy with a microphone. He's
breathing hard, his helmet off, hair sticking up everywhere.
And still, somehow, he looks amazing.
Maybe even better than before.
There's a sheen of sweat covering his face and his cheeks are red from
exertion, but damn does he still look lickable.
Ryan snorts from beside me. “You got that right.”
Oh crap. I must have said that out loud.
“Collin, wow,” the interviewer says. “What a night for you, huh?”
“I just got out there and played hockey, you know,” Collin answers.
“Oh my god. You never told me his voice was that deep.”
Ryan's practically drooling, and I can't blame her one bit.
“I bet it had to feel good putting up a goal and an assist after the Game
Six loss last season and the off-season drama that happened afterward.”
Collin chuckles, a grin that might look playful to others pulling at his
lips. That's not his real smile though. I know that for a fact.
“That's one word for it,” he says.
“Now, Collin, it's no secret that you've been struggling a bit this season
so far. We know it's still early on, but preseason was a bit of a mess. What
changed for you tonight?”
Collin's eyes flit across the ice.
I peel my eyes off the screen, and for the third time tonight, our gazes
collide.
“Just had better focus. Something to prove, you know.”
“And prove it you did.” The interviewer laughs like he just made the
funniest joke in the world. “All right, Collin, we'll let you get back to your
teammates. Thanks for talking with us for a moment, and congrats again on
the win tonight.”
“Thanks, J.P.”
Collin shakes the guy's hand, then heads off the bench and down the
tunnel.
The interviewer continues to talk, but I tune him out.
Ryan squeals next to me. “Holy crap, Harper. He is…” She fans herself.
“Hot. So fucking hot.”
“Too bad he's a liar.”
“Crap.” A frown pulls at her lips. “I forgot about that part. Ready to get
out of here?”
“Please.”
“Drinks?”
“God yes.”
She laughs, linking her arm with mine, dragging me up the steps.
“Miss Harper?” someone calls out.
I spin back around to find a man standing there, holding a stick.
“Um…yes?”
“This is from Mr. Wright. He specifically asked that it be delivered to
you.”
“To…me?”
“Yes, ma'am.”
I'm acutely aware people are staring at us right now. This man with that
hockey stick, trying to hand it off to me. Me just standing there with a
dropped jaw, trying to wrap my head around it.
“Harper,” Ryan says quietly. “Just take it. People are staring.”
“He insisted, ma'am,” the guy says, shaking the stick.
“I…okay,” I say quietly, curling my fingers around it. “Thank you.”
“Have a good evening, ma'am.”
The guy scurries away, leaving me standing there with a long, heavy
piece of equipment in my hand.
“Did…that just happen?” Ryan asks.
“I think so.” I grasp it warily. I've never held a hockey stick before. “It's
much bigger than I anticipated.”
“And I sincerely hope that's what you're saying when you get him into
bed.”
“Ryan!”
“What?” She shrugs. “It's the romantic in me.” She tugs at me. “Now
come on. There's a bar around the corner. Let's drink and figure out how
we're going to handle this.”

COLLIN
“Dude! Yes!” Rhodes says as I enter the dressing room after all the press
meetings. He pats me hard on the back, and I cough up the water I was
chugging. “Fucking yes! That's the shit we need out there all season, man.”
He's ecstatic, grinning as much as Rhodes grins.
“Yeah, yeah. You scored too,” I remind him.
“Yeah, but you needed it more than I did.”
I did need it. So fucking badly.
I'm hyped I scored.
To have Coach look at me with pride instead of worry, to have my
teammates who have been on the fence about me looking at me like I'm not
a complete failure…it feels so damn good.
But I can't get that look on Harper's face out of my head.
“What's wrong? Your face just totally dropped. You—oh. Shit. The
girl.”
“Harper.”
“Who's Harper? And more importantly, does she have anything to do
with your game tonight?” Lowell asks, flopping down beside me. “Because
if so, keep her ass around.”
“She's…”
Well, fuck. Is she the girl who nearly ran me over? The girl I've been
messaging? The girl I'm supposed to be going on a date with tomorrow? Or
is she just someone I barely knew?
I settle on “It's complicated.”
“Yeah, well, uncomplicate it. We need your head in the game like it was
tonight. Need that magic. And if she's it, fix it.”
Fucking hockey players and their superstitions.
Some of us tape our own stick before each game. Some want to be the
last off of the ice. Some have special routines they need to follow.
We all have something.
Truthfully, it crossed my mind for a millisecond that I scored because of
Harper.
She's the only difference I've made.
Maybe…maybe she is my good luck charm.
Rhodes clears his throat, and I glance up at him.
“Fix it for the reasons not running around in your head right now.”
I sigh. He's right…again.
Asshole.
“I hear you,” I tell him.
Lowell's gaze bounces between the two of us, trying to figure out
what's going on.
“Slapshots tonight, boys,” Miller says, coming over to join us. He claps
his hands together, probably still buzzing from the game. “Gotta celebrate
those two points for our favorite geezer.”
Lowell sends him a murderous glare. “I'm older than him and take great
offense to that, so I will end you.”
“I'm shaking.” Miller rolls his eyes, completely unfazed by the
captain's threat.
“Need I remind you, I'm older than all of you by a long shot,” Smith,
one of our centers, says from down the bench.
He's one of those dudes who has been in the NHL for years and a guy
you want on your team. He doesn't make fancy plays and gets the job done,
a background player you never hear much about but who holds a team
together a lot more than most realize.
Miller's eyes are wide as he stares up at the six-foot-six giant. “Crap.
Now I really am shaking.”
We all laugh at the rookie.
“I'm down for Slapshots,” Lowell says. “I can never sleep after a win
anyway.”
“Rhodes, you in?”
He looks over at me before he commits, and I shrug. “Why not?”
“Fuck it,” Rhodes says. “I'm in too. But Lowell is buying us all beers.”
“I am?”
“Yep.” Rhodes slaps him on the back. “Don't worry, I've seen your
AAV—you can afford it.”
The moment we walked into Slapshots, we were bombarded with fans who
were hungry for our attention. We gave our best press smiles and made our
way through the crowd to find a quiet table in the back.
Rod drops off our usual drinks, sending a clear Leave them be message
to the crowd with a deadly look, and save for a few of the drunker fans
stumbling over now and again, it works.
We've only been here for twenty minutes, and I think I check my phone
at least twice a minute.
Did Harper not see my number scrawled across the stick?
Did she see it and just not care?
I hold my breath as I click on the BeeMine app, expecting to find that
we've been unmatched.
We haven't.
All of our messages are right there.
I type out a few different things.
I fucked up.
Delete.
I'm an idiot.
Delete.
I'm sorry.
Send.
“All right, man, what's with the obsessive phone checking? Oh, crap—what
dumbass thing did you say during press this time?”
I flip Lowell off and he laughs.
I might have a bit of a reputation for accidentally cursing during the live
press meetings or saying something I shouldn't. I keep telling Coach to
keep me away from the camera, but he never listens.
“It's a girl,” Miller says, peeking over my shoulder to see what I'm
looking at. “It's gotta be. I see that BeeMine app on his phone. I don't get it.
You're a hotshot hockey player—you can get laid any time you want.”
I catch Lowell's eyes from across the table. He doesn't ask why I'm on
the app, probably because he understands it without me saying anything.
We all used to be like Miller once: young, dumb, excited about women
throwing themselves at us. Then we got older and jaded and more cautious.
Given how the last relationship Lowell was in went, I know he understands.
“It's nothing,” I mutter.
“Yeah, definitely a girl. I bet—”
My phone buzzes and I check it faster than a middle schooler waiting to
hear from their crush.
Shep Clark: Fucking nice job tonight. Good to have you back.
I shoot him back a quick text, then lay my phone down with a sigh.
When I glance back up, all the guys are staring at me.
“What?” I bark.
Lowell laughs, Miller doesn't say shit, and Rhodes just shakes his head.
“It's not a chick. It's—Harper?”
She's sitting across the bar, her head bent low, giggling at something her
friend—the same girl from her profile pictures—says.
I can't believe it's her.
I can't believe she was at my game tonight.
I can't believe she's here. Right here. In this bar.
A body steps in front of her table, blocking her from my view.
The dude steps in way too close, resting his elbows on the table,
ignoring all her cues as she shrinks away from him.
He turns, and I swear I see red.
I'd know that ugly fucker anywhere.
It's Colter.
I'm out of my seat and crossing the bar before I know what I'm doing,
the guys yelling at my back. I ignore them because there is no fucking way
I am leaving her alone with him.
He's a slimy shit and I don't trust him.
Harper catches my eye as I approach, and I can already see the relief
flashing in her gaze.
I don't bother sparing Colter a glance as I wrap my arm around her and
say, “There you are.”
She sinks into me, and I don't know if it's for show or if it's her body
acting on its own; either way, I like it entirely too much.
“I tried texting you.” I lift my brows as if to say Just go with it. “We're
back in the corner.” I flick my eyes to my teammate. “Oh, hey, Colter.
Didn't see you there.”
His eyes bounce between me and Harper. “Uh, you two know each
other?”
“Yep.” I pull her in closer, planting a kiss on her temple. “Thanks for
checking in with her, but I got it from here.” I look down at Harper. “Come
on, ladies. Don't want the douchebags bothering you for too long.”
Harper rolls her lips together, trying not to laugh, and her friend grabs
her drink, looking more than happy to leave Colter behind too.
I pull Harper behind me toward the back of the bar, trying not to think
too much about how good her hand feels in mine.
She tugs on it, stopping me when we're nearly there.
“We're in the clear.” She slips her hand away, and I instantly miss the
warmth. We nearly collide when I turn to face her and she startles, glaring
up at me. “Thanks for the rescue.”
“That guy had total slimeball vibes,” her friend says. She juts out a hand
between us. “Hi, I'm Ryan.”
I clasp her hand in mine. “Nice to meet you, Ryan. I'm—”
“Oh,” she interrupts, squeezing my hand tighter. “I know who you are.
You're an ass.”
I look to Harper for help, but she just lifts her brows as if to say Yeah,
what she said.
“I don't disagree,” I tell Ryan, pulling my hand back. I want to shake it
out because damn did she have a strong grip, but I don't want to give her
the satisfaction. I turn to Harper. “Can we talk?”
“I—”
“Yes,” Ryan answers for her. She points at the table with Lowell, Miller,
and Rhodes. “I'm going to find my future husband. You two go talk.”
She gives Harper a look that I have no idea how to interpret and sashays
toward the table.
“Evening, boys,” I hear her say, sliding into the chair I abandoned.
They all perk up at her presence, ready to salivate over her.
Not that I blame them. Ryan is gorgeous.
But she's not Harper.
I turn back to find her peering up at me with wary eyes.
I dip my head toward the bar. “Want to sit?”
She doesn't answer, just gives me a curt nod and leads the way.
We settle in on two stools, and I signal for Rod. I don't normally have
more than one or two drinks when we go out during the season, but tonight
I can tell I'm going to need several.
He brings me over a beer and drops off another of whatever Harper's
having.
I tip my drink back and take a long pull, letting the alcohol do its thing.
I wipe my mouth on the back of my hand and peek over at Harper. Her
fingers are wrapped around her straw and she's stirring her drink, staring
down at it like it contains all the answers to life's questions.
I run a hand through my hair and spin toward her. “Look, Harper, I—”
“Hey, man! Sweet fucking goal tonight,” a guy says, stumbling way too
far into my space.
“Thanks,” I reply curtly, inching away. I give my attention to Harper.
“I—”
“Oh, man. Who do we have here?” the guy interrupts, leaning into
Harper's face this time. “Damn, you're hot.”
He reaches out like he's going to touch her, and I snap.
I shoot to my feet and grab the guy by the collar, tugging him up to his
tiptoes.
I faintly hear the scraping of chairs over the floor and I have no doubt
it's the guys, ready to back me up if needed.
There are several people around us, staring in surprise, waiting to see
what happens.
I yank the drunken idiot closer. “Don't even think about putting your
hands on her, or anyone else for that matter.”
He lifts his hands in the air, eyes wide with shock. “I-I-I—”
“Fucking got it?” I growl.
The guy bobs his head up and down several times, swallowing thickly.
“Y-Yeah, man. S-Sorry.”
“Apologize to her, not me.”
He looks over at Harper, fear in his eyes. “S-Sorry, miss. Had a few too
m-many.”
“Not a fucking excuse.” I drop him back to his feet and he stumbles a
bit. “Now go. Sober the fuck up.”
“Shit, man,” he murmurs as he scurries to leave. “Think I already have.”
I stare him down until he disappears into the crowd.
“Good?” Rhodes calls out.
“Swear I am so wet right now,” I hear Ryan say.
I drop back onto the stool, ignoring them all.
“Are you okay?” I ask Harper.
“That's twice.”
“Huh?”
“That you've rescued me tonight. That's twice.”
“Oh.” I shrug. “It's not a big deal.”
She just nods, then takes a sip of her drink.
An uncomfortable silence falls between us, and I hate it. I miss that
level of comfort we had in the car together. That easy conversation we had
when we were messaging.
I don't like whatever this is, and I know it's all my fault.
“I'm sorry,” I finally say, breaking the tension.
She whips her head toward me, a deep crease between her brows.
“You're sorry?”
“Yes.”
“For what part?” She waves her hands, giving me the floor. “Go on.
Elaborate for me. Tell me what you're sorry for exactly.”
I open my mouth to explain things, but nothing comes out, the words
frozen on my tongue.
She scoffs. “Of course. You're sorry but you can't admit what you did
wrong.” She shakes her head. “Let's try: Harper, I'm sorry I didn't tell you
who I am that night in the car. Sure, we had over four hours together and I
could have mentioned it at any point, but instead, I chose to lie about it. Or:
I'm sorry that when I found your profile on a dating app, instead of just
messaging you and saying who I am like a normal person, I lied and led you
on for weeks. Or maybe even: I'm sorry I let you believe I was a good guy.
By the way, I have two arrests for assault. Try any of those, Collin.”
She spits my name out like it's the most disgusting thing she's ever
heard.
And honestly, she has every right to feel that way.
I deserve it.
Everything she said is true, and her ire is warranted.
That doesn't make it sting any less.
“I'm sorry I didn't tell you who I was at first. It's… Well, I've had
people take advantage of me before because of who I am, and I didn't know
if I could trust you. And yeah, I should have told you who I was when I
found you on BeeMine. But the lie by omission,” I say pointedly because it
wasn't an outright lie, causing her to roll her eyes, “was already set in stone
at that point.”
She opens her mouth to say something, but I cut her off.
“And, I just want to point out, I was arrested for assault twice but was
only found guilty once.”
“Is that supposed to make it okay?”
“Well, no. But it's not like I just jumped someone for shits and giggles. I
had my reasons.”
She waits for me to explain my side of things.
I don't talk about it a lot, mostly because I've never had to with it being
expunged. Now that it's out there, I've still stayed tightlipped because at the
end of the day, it won't matter why I did it. They're going to believe
whatever they want anyway.
But with Harper…I want to set the record straight with her.
I lean in close, and unlike with the other two men to get in her space
tonight, she doesn't shy away. She leans closer, too.
She smells like fresh, crisp apples, and I just happen to love apples.
“Remember my brother I told you about?”
“You mean the brother Wright told me about?”
I grind my teeth together, irritated with myself.
“Yeah.” I clear my throat. “Anyway, the shit when I was younger was
about him. Some people in small-town Kansas didn't take too well to the
fact that he's gay. After some kids assaulted him and the school board
turned a blind eye to it, I took matters into my own hands. Nobody wanted
to believe or cared about what happened to the queer kid, so it was me who
got in trouble. I was sixteen. I got adjudicated for assault, got one year of
probation, had to pay restitution, got a hug from my brother and a cake
from my parents. The other kids? They didn't get shit for what they did.” I
shake my head, disgusted by the treatment they received, like they were
fucking untouchable. “As soon as I could, I had it expunged from my
record, but once the media got hold of it…” I lift a shoulder. “It didn't
matter anymore.”
She regards me for a moment, eyes flitting across my face, over the cut
on my lip from my scuffle with Colter this morning.
I'm sure to her I look like nothing but a hothead.
But I refuse to apologize for sticking up for my brother. I'd do it all over
again in a heartbeat. Just like I'd punch out that guy who was touching that
woman without her permission.
“Thank you for telling me that,” she says quietly. “Your brother is lucky
to have you.”
Her words surprise me and a knot forms in my throat, though I'm not
sure why. I swallow them down with a nod.
“How'd you hear about the arrests anyway?”
“Some people were making comments at the game and…”
“You ran to Google?”
“Ryan did.”
I like that she has someone looking out for her. That's good.
“Ryan seems…fun.”
For the first time since our night in the car, Harper gives me a genuine
smile.
I didn't realize how badly I needed it either.
“She's the best. Truly. Forces me out of my shell, maybe a little too
much sometimes.”
She looks away, her attention back on her drink as she twists her straw
between her fingers, that silence I'm really beginning to hate falling over us
once more.
It lasts and lasts…and lasts some more.
Unable to take it any longer, I open my mouth to speak, but she beats
me to it.
I look over to find her staring up at me with an intense gaze. “I'm really
mad at you, Collin.”
I expel a heavy breath and mirror her pose. “I know you are.”
“I hate being lied to. It's kind of a deal-breaker for me.”
“Kind of?” She nods. “Well, good.”
Her brows knit together and she tips her head to the side. “It's a good
thing it's a deal-breaker?”
“It's a good thing it's kind of a deal-breaker. That means there's room
for me to convince you otherwise.”
There's a hint of a smile at the corner of her mouth, but it's gone as fast
as it appeared. She traps her bottom lip between her teeth, like she's trying
to fight the grin that wants to break free. Like she's trying to tamp down
what she's feeling.
Before I realize what I'm doing, I reach over and pluck it free, running
the pad of my thumb over the indention her teeth have left.
Her breath is warm against my skin, her blue eyes wide with surprise.
I trace her soft lips back and forth and back. I can't seem to make
myself stop touching her, and she isn't telling me to stop.
The noise of the bar fades away.
It's just us right now.
“I'm sorry I didn't tell you who I am,” I say quietly, leaning closer. “But
if you'll let me, I'll show you instead.”
There's an obvious hitch to her breath, and she swallows thickly.
I run my thumb over her lip again, her eyes darkening before me.
“Go out with me, Harper. Please.”
Another gulp.
Then, a nod.
“Okay.”

HARPER
“Be honest. Am I stupid for saying yes to him?”
“Hell no!” Ryan's words echo around my tiny bathroom. I have my
phone propped up against a bottle of hair serum so I can talk to her while I
get ready. “No, no, no. You were absolutely, one hundred percent right.”
I grin down at her. “You're just saying that because you're totally
smitten with his teammates.”
She lifts a hand, studying the nails she's painting. “I mean, they weren't
bad eye candy. Even though that one guy was a complete grump, he was
still hot.”
I smile at how she calls Rhodes that one guy even though she wouldn't
shut up about him on our Uber ride home last night.
Last night when I said yes to a date with Collin…again.
I don't know why I did it, and despite what Ryan says—how can I trust
her romantic ass anyway?—I'm not so sure it was the best idea.
But…I could understand why he wasn't completely forthcoming with
information the first night we met. I was a stranger and he was in a tough
spot. He didn't know if he could trust me.
As for lying the second time, letting me think he was someone else for
weeks…well, that part is a little less forgivable.
Even though my brain was yelling at me to tell him no, that's not what
my mouth said.
It said yes.
Well, more accurately, it said okay.
So here I am, getting ready for a date with an NHL player.
“Wear it down,” she instructs as I go to put my hair up in a ponytail.
“What if it gets in the way? I don't even know where we're going.”
“He wouldn't tell you?”
“No. And I told him that was incredibly inconvenient for me because I
have no idea how to dress, but he just laughed. Laughed, Ryan!”
“Men.” She rolls her eyes. “They just don't get it. He'll probably show
up in a t-shirt that clings to those stupid muscles of his and jeans that look
like they've been painted on.”
I drop my hair and lift my brows at her. “Have you been checking out
my date?”
“Of course I have. He's hot.”
I chuckle. Leave it to Ryan to be honest about ogling Collin.
Not that I blame her. He is hot.
When I saw him at the game last night, the bright lights of the arena
illuminating all his features in a way I hadn't seen before…just wow.
He was attractive in the shadows, but beneath the lights? Even with the
cut on his lip and the bruise forming on his jaw, he was beautiful.
I run my fingers through my hair, letting my natural curls do their thing.
I always save my hair for last, and if I'm wearing it down, then…
I drop my hands to my sides, my palms beginning to sweat as the nerves
set in when I realize this is it. I'm going on a date with Collin Wright.
I give myself a once-over. I don't typically wear a ton of makeup, and
tonight is no exception. Just a few coats of mascara, a light layer of
eyeshadow, and a soft matte pink lipstick. Since I have no clue where we're
going, I went with something casual. I paired jeans that hug me in all the
right places with a simple burnt-orange tank top, a color block cardigan to
match, and a pair of Converse.
“Do I look too…plain?”
“No.”
“You're not even looking at me!” I complain.
“Because I don't need to. There is nothing about you that's plain. I
promise.”
“That sounds almost like both a compliment and an insult.”
“Because it was.”
I stick my tongue out at her. “Brat.”
“You love me. Now, do me a favor and head for the kitchen.”
I don't ask what we're doing, I just grab my phone and walk us into the
kitchen.
“Get into your liquor cabinet and do a shot of that whiskey you have
hidden in the back.”
“Ryan! I am not drinking before my date.”
“Yes, you are, because I swear I can feel your tension from here. It's
palpable.”
“It is not,” I argue, though I push to my tiptoes and reach for the booze
that's stashed away. I pull out a shot glass—one Ryan left here, I'm sure—
and pour a drink.
“Quit staring at it and drink it. Here, I'll do one with you.”
“You know, it's funny because you sound resigned to help me, but I
know doing a few shots is no hardship for you.”
“Fine, you caught me. I'm just doing this so I'm not drinking alone.”
“I thought you were seeing Steven again tonight.”
She sends me a look that says she doesn't want to talk about it and takes
a swig from the bottle of tequila she's now holding. I want to press, but I
know she'll just change the subject. If she wanted to discuss it, she would. I
know her well enough to know when to back off.
“Go on,” she encourages. “Drink. It'll help your nerves.”
Eh…what the hell. Why not?
I lift the glass and down the hatch it goes, the alcohol burning the back
of my throat. I cough a little, shaking my head. “Blech.” I stick my tongue
out. “It does not mix well with my toothpaste.”
“Do another just to wash down the bad taste.”
She doesn't have to talk me into it this time.
“Ah. Much better,” I say, running my tongue over my lips, already
feeling the booze soak into my veins.
“Another?” she asks.
I shake my head. “Better not. Don't want to get drunk on my first date.”
“Boo!” She takes two drinks, one for each of us. She grimaces and rubs
the back of her hand across her lips, then beams at me, her eyes glassy from
the buzz. “I can't believe you're going on a date with an NHL player. Like,
what? You hate sports.”
“But I love hot men.”
She giggles. “Hot men are nice. Especially ones who won't screw you
around.” She adds the last part quietly, but I know what she's referring to.
It's on the tip of my tongue to ask her if I should cancel tonight and spend
the evening with her, but I know she'll probably yell at me if I even suggest
it.
She shakes her head like she's shaking away bad thoughts. “Anyway, I
had better get a text or phone call when you get wherever you're going
tonight. Just in case I need to come rescue you.”
I look pointedly at the bottle in her hand. If anyone is doing any
rescuing tonight, it'll be me rescuing her. I make a mental note to keep my
phone close in case she needs me.
“What?” She shrugs. “I'll Uber.”
My doorbell sounds and my back goes ramrod straight.
Holy shit! “He's here!”
Ryan's eyes widen and she does a little happy dance. “Ahh! Okay, okay.
Go buzz him up. Then bang him. Then go on your date.”
“Ryan!”
“At least give the guy a blow job!”
I shake my head, trying to hold in my laughter as I head to the living
room to buzz Collin in.
“Fine.” She huffs. “Date first, then banging.”
“Behave. He's on his way up,” I tell her.
“You better keep me on the phone until he gets there. I want to lay down
some ground rules.”
“No. I'm hanging up now.”
“You're no fun.” She pouts. “But fine.” She seems to sober up for a
minute and stares deeply into the phone. “If you need me, call me. No
matter where you are. No matter how far.”
“Now I really know you're drunk. You're speaking in song lyrics.”
“I was quoting a queen, thank you very much. Have fun tonight. For
yourself, and me.”
“That might be more fun than I can handle.”
“Probably.”
There's a knock at my door and Ryan squeals loudly.
“Shh!” I hiss.
“Sorry, sorry. I've just never been so excited for someone else to get
dicked before.”
“Ryan Felicity Bell!”
“What? You know you love me.”
“I do. Which is why I'm hanging up.”
“You're not moving,” she says.
“It's because I'm nervous.”
“Don't be. Just go. Be yourself. He's gonna love you as much as I do, I
just know it.”
“You're my best friend. You have to say that.”
“Do not. Love you. Bye.”
She hangs up, leaving me standing there staring at my phone, still
unable to move.
Another knock sounds at the door, and I jump.
I rub my hands over my jeans, blowing out a heavy breath. Then
another.
Okay. It's okay. I can do this. I got this. It's just a first date. I've had
those before. It's no big deal. Sure, it's with an NHL player, but whatever. I
got this.
“You know you're talking out loud, right?”
I let out a squeak, and Collin's deep rumbly laugh filters through the
door.
“I promise not to bite. Well, that's not true. I'll nip at you, but not in
places anyone else can see.”
If he thinks that's going to help my nerves, he's wrong.
If anything, the way his words have my legs feeling like jelly makes me
want to hide even more.
“Harper…”
My name on his lips is my undoing.
I peel the door open and…
Son of a bitch. Ryan was right.
He's wearing a deep green t-shirt that clings to him and a pair of jeans
I'm certain look really good from behind. There's a dark brown leather
jacket draped over his shoulders that makes him look just a hint dangerous
with his split lip. A layer of stubble is covering his jaw and the bruise I
know is there too.
When I finally drag my eyes up his body and to his face, I find him
staring down at me with a grin.
“Hi.”
The word comes out as a whisper, and his grin grows.
“Hi.”
His eyes flit over my shoulder, taking in my small, sparse apartment.
It's probably not nearly as big and flashy as what he can afford.
“Do you, uh, want to come in for a moment?”
“Actually, we're kind of on a time crunch.”
“Are you going to tell me where we're going?”
“No.”
A simple answer followed by another grin.
“Okay, but if we get there and I'm not dressed appropriately, I'm going
to…to…kick you in the shin.”
“Because that's as high as you can reach on me?”
My brows shoot up, and it's not lost on me how I have to tip my head
back to look at him properly. “Was that…a short joke?”
“Yeah. Did I need to lean down to say it so you could hear me better?”
I laugh, shaking my head, and reach over to grab my purse from the
hook beside the door.
“Has anyone ever told you you're a shithead?” I ask, forcing him out of
my doorway as I pull my front door shut and lock it.
“A few times.” He's standing close, his warmth flowing over me and
making me already wish I'd worn my hair up. His lips graze my ear. “You
look gorgeous, Harper.”
I gulp. “Thank you.”
We make our way to the elevator and take the short ride down four
floors in silence. The car is small and usually feels as such, but with Collin
in here, it feels even tinier.
He holds the door open for me as we exit the building, his hand landing
on my lower back as he steers me in the right direction.
We're not taking a car, and suddenly I'm glad I didn't wear any heels.
We walk side by side for about half a block, not speaking a word, our
arms brushing together every few steps.
“So, hockey, huh?”
He barks out a laugh. “That's where you want to start?”
“I mean, it is kind of a big deal for you.”
He lifts his broad shoulders. “You could say I'm a fan.”
I narrow my eyes on him. “Funny, you said the same thing the first time
I asked if you're into sports.”
He winces. “I suppose I did. And I wasn't technically lying. I am a fan.”
“And a player.”
“And a player,” he confirms, shoving his hands into his pockets. “I'm
sorry I wasn't honest with you, Harper.”
I stop walking, and he comes to an abrupt stop too.
We stand in the middle of the sidewalk, staring at one another.
“I know you are, Collin. But I also want you to know that even if you
think you're doing it for the right reason, I won't tolerate being lied to.”
He nods once. “Understood.”
We resume walking.
“So what's an NHL player doing on a dating app anyway?”
He laughs, but there's no humor to it. “It's stupid, really. I've been…
having some trouble this year getting out of my head and into the game. As
you can imagine, dating is hard. So I figured…”
“You'd find someone on the app and bang it out of your system?”
He winces. “Shit. That sounds awful, but yeah, pretty much. That was
before I saw you on there though. When I came across your profile, plans
changed and I—”
“So you don't want to sleep with me?”
“What? No! I mean, yes! Of course I do. You're gorgeous. I would
totally sleep with you. I—oh.” He takes in the grin on my face. “You were
teasing me.”
“I was. But it's good to know…” I peek up at him. “Just in case.”
His eyes spark with interest at my words. “Just in case, huh?”
“Yeah.”
Before I know it, large hands are circling my waist and I'm being pulled
into an alleyway and backed up against a wall.
Collin cages me in, one hand on my waist, the other cradling my head
so it doesn't bounce against the brick wall. He's holding his body off mine
but not so far away that his warmth isn't seeping into my bones.
Yeah, I definitely should have worn my hair up. Sweat begins to form on
the back of my neck, and it has nothing to do with the weather outside. It's
a cool, October evening. Not an ounce of humidity in the air.
His green eyes bore into me as he steps closer. “Just in case what,
Harper?”
Just like before, my name rolling off his tongue does something to me.
My knees nearly buckle, but he holds me up with ease.
“I-I thought we were on a time crunch?” I ask, out of breath even
though I haven't done anything to cause it.
“We are, but I have time to listen to your just-in-case scenario.”
I swallow the lump in my throat, my tongue darting out to wet my dry
lips.
His eyes follow the movement. His hand leaves the wall to cup my face,
his thumb tracing along my lip just like it did last night.
I hold my breath, relishing the feel of his simple touch that I swear I
could still feel as I fell asleep last night.
It was like he'd burned my skin and marked me.
“You smell like whiskey.”
“I took some shots.”
His brows pinch together in an unasked question.
“I was nervous,” I explain. “You make me nervous.”
“I do?”
I nod, unable to speak.
He stares at my mouth, watching the thumb he's brushing back and
forth.
“I should have kissed you,” he murmurs. He drags his eyes back to
mine. “That night after our drive…I should have kissed you.”
“You should have,” I agree. I wanted him to so badly. “I would have let
you.”
“I want to kiss you now.”
“You can.”
His eyes darken at my words and he leans in closer, lips hovering just
an inch above mine.
“I can't.” The words are whispered, and neither of us misses the
whimper that leaves me. “If I kiss you now, I won't stop.”
“Is that a bad thing?”
“It is when I have a whole evening planned.”
“Do we have to go?”
He lets out a string of curse words, then puts some space between us.
“Yes. I told you I wanted to show you who I am, and I meant that. I want to
earn your kisses, not take them from you.”
I want to point out that he's not taking, I'm offering.
But I also respect his desire to want to make up for his mistakes.
“Is this one of those times when you're being a gentleman?”
“Yes. So enjoy it while it lasts.”
I grin and push off the wall.
“Then lead the way.”

COLLIN
“You can't be serious.”
“Oh, I am.”
She stares up at the building in question. “This is cruel.”
She has no idea what I have planned next.
“It's not.”
“But I'm going to want to take them all home.”
“You will.”
“And I can't take them all home.”
“You can't,” I agree. “But trust me, this is the next best thing.”
“Fine but I swear, if I walk out of here with a broken heart, I want it on
record it's your fault.”
“Deal.”
I pull open the door to Pawever in Love and usher Harper inside.
“Ah, Collin! It's so good to see you. We missed you this summer.”
Harper gives me a quizzical look, and I hope the one I send back says
I'll explain later.
“Hey, Rachelle,” I say to the vet tech sitting behind the counter I've
stood in front of too many times to count. “How are the kids?”
“They're a handful. You just missed them actually. Dante is starting first
grade this year, and Dixon is in sixth. He told me he wants to play football.”
“Football? He sure he doesn't want to do hockey instead?”
She laughs. “I told him you'd say that, but…” She shrugs. “He's
obsessed with Tom Brady.”
“I'll make sure to pop in one day when they're here. Maybe I can sway
him.” I wink. “What about the other kids? They ready for us?”
“Oh, of course. I'll go grab them.” She gives me a warm smile, shaking
her head. “You have no idea how much we—and they—appreciate it. We all
know you're busy, busy, busy. How you find the time, I don't know, but we
don't take it for granted, that's for certain.”
“Trust me, I do this for me just as much as I do it for them.”
Rachelle scurries down the hall and I turn to Harper, whose stare I can
feel burning into the side of my head.
“Do you come here often?”
“Whenever my schedule allows. I usually stop in a few times a week if
we're on a home game stretch. Typically I spend a lot of time here in the
off-season, but this year Coach thought it would be best if I went back
home.”
She nods, understanding. “The arrest.”
I try not to wince. “Yeah.”
“And what do you do here? Volunteer?”
“I—”
The scraping of excited paws on the floor draws my attention, and I turn
to find Rachelle being pulled down the hall by two rambunctious pups.
“Ah, Mario, my man!” I drop to my haunches as my favorite English
bulldog scrambles over to me, jumping into my lap as best as his stubby
legs allow. I rub my hand between his ears as he digs into me, licking at my
shirt. “Missed you too, buddy.”
A Chihuahua, a new dog I don't know, tries to push Mario away, but
he's not budging.
“And what's your name, huh? Please tell me it's Luigi.”
“As awesome as that would be, no. This little princess is Nacho.”
I glance up at Rachelle. “Nacho?”
“She was found out behind a bar eating nachos and the name stuck.”
Much to Mario's dismay, I run my hands over Nacho. She looks to be in
good shape. No scars or visible issues. “Nobody claimed her?”
“No, but someone called looking for a Chihuahua not long after she was
brought in. When I told them about Nacho, they seemed to be relieved and
hung up. I'm guessing she was theirs and they dumped her somewhere, then
felt guilty and wanted to make sure she was okay.”
“Fuckers,” I say. “Sorry for the language.”
Rachelle waves her hand. “Please. My husband was in the Marines. He
says ten times worse.”
I stand and both dogs jump at my shins, not wanting me to let them go.
Nacho prances over to Harper, smelling her, then curls up on top of her feet.
“Ah, hell. I'm so rude. Harper, this is Rachelle, my favorite vet tech.
Rachelle, this is Harper. She's…”
“A friend,” Harper supplies, sticking her hand out to greet Rachelle,
who bounces her eyes between the two of us, not buying the friends thing
for a second. “Lovely to meet you.”
“Likewise.” Rachelle leans in. “Don't let this man fool you. I know
Penny is his favorite. She's about sixty-five and is always patting his ass.
We all know she's the reason he keeps coming back.”
Harper laughs. “I'll take your word for it.”
Rachelle hands Nacho's leash to Harper and Mario's to me.
“All right,” she says, “you four have fun. Just make sure they're back
within the hour so we have time for cleanup.”
“Yes, ma'am,” I say, letting Mario pull me toward the door.
We head out the front door and don't even make it twenty feet before
someone stops to pet the dogs.
“So, a hockey player with a soft spot for animals, huh?” Harper asks
once we're finally on our way to our destination.
“Yep.” I nod. “We had a dog growing up and I loved him so much. We
went everywhere together. I swear I cried for about three weeks when
Bobby passed.”
“You named your dog Bobby?”
“Yep. After Bobby Orr, one of the greatest defensemen to ever play the
game.”
She grins. “Of course you did.”
“Anyway,” I say, steering us toward the park not too far up the street,
“I've always wanted to get a dog, but since it's just me, and with my
schedule, it's not something I feel right doing. So instead, whenever I can, I
walk the shelter dogs. That way I get my dog cuddles in and they get the
love and attention they deserve.”
“That's incredibly sweet, Collin.”
“It's really no big deal.” I shrug, hoping she doesn't see the heat I feel
coating my cheeks.
When we finally reach the park, I lead the dogs over to the sectioned-off
area and let them off their leashes inside the fence.
They go nuts, running back and forth and back, stopping to pee every
few feet to mark their territory.
We take a seat on the bench, letting them play for a few minutes but
keeping an eye on them.
“Can I tell you something?”
I glance over at Harper. Her eyes are trained in the direction of the dogs
but her gaze is far away, somewhere else entirely.
“Sure.”
“In the car, I had this whole image of you built up in my head. You were
this regular guy who worked in the sports industry”—I ignore the pointed
look she gives me—“and you did and liked normal things, like fast-food
chicken nuggets and horror movies.”
“I still like those things.”
“Right. But when I found out you're a hockey player, that all got erased.
You became…” She lifts a shoulder, shaking her head. “I don't know.
Something else. Something…bigger. And now…”
“Now?”
“Now I kind of want to kick you in the shin still.”
I tilt my head on a laugh. “Why?”
“Because you're still this big, untouchable thing, but you're also this
normal guy who does kind things like take shelter dogs for walks and talks
to Rachelle about her kids and saves me from drunken idiots and beats
people up because they're awful to your brother. It's annoying.”
“Annoying?”
“Yes! Because you're…” She throws her hands in the air like she's
exhausted. “Well, you! Hot, famous hockey player with a bad rap but a
secret heart of gold. And, well, I'm just me.”
“First of all,” I say, shifting toward her, one arm outstretched on the
back of the bench, the other hand going to her face to bring her eyes to
mine. “I'm flattered that you think I'm hot.”
She rolls her eyes, trying to pull out of my grasp, but I don't let her.
“Second, I'm still me. Aside from not telling you that I play hockey,
everything I told you was all true. Hockey is a big part of my life, yes, I
won't deny that. But I have an identity outside the game too.”
“I know that. I just—”
“Third,” I interrupt, “you are not just you, Harper. You're smart and
funny and gorgeous. Talented as hell. You do that cute”—I make sure to
emphasize the word—“rambling thing. You like what you like and you
don't apologize for it or try to fit into some box for society. You're you…
and that's exactly why I like you.”
Her eyes are searching mine, looking for any hint that I'm lying, I'm
sure.
But I'm not. I mean it.
I know it's so fucking cliche to say the whole You're not like other girls
thing, but in this case, it's true. If her profile hadn't stuck out because I
knew her, it would have for a different reason.
I've lost count of the number of times I've met the wives of my
teammates and they start to tell me about themselves and it sounds like
they're reading from the same script. Hell, even their social media pages all
look the same. Same filters, same content, same sponsored posts, same
outfits, same houses.
Same, same, same.
It gets old. It gets boring.
Harper? She's anything but boring.
“And fourth?” I lean closer, and whether she does it on purpose or
subconsciously, she does the same. “I assure you, I am not untouchable.
You can touch me any time you want.”
“See? That!” She groans, pulling away. “You can't say things like that.”
“Why not?”
“Because it makes me like you!”
“Is that a bad thing?”
“I don't know yet.”
It takes us fifteen minutes to leave Nacho and Mario behind because Harper
couldn't stop hugging them.
“If you love dogs so much, why don't you get one?” I ask as we leave
Pawever in Love and head for the parking garage I left my car in.
“I don't know. I'm not sure I'm ready for that kind of commitment.”
“Your profile said something about commitment too,” I point out.
“I'm just…cautious is all.” She doesn't look at me when she says this
and I feel like there's something more there that needs unpacked, but it's
really none of my business.
Besides, I'm not looking for serious either. Not right now, anyway.
“I understand. You want to keep it casual and see what happens?”
“Yes. Is that…is that okay?”
Harper helps keep my mind off of the game, and the fact that she
doesn't want strings when I'm not in any position to offer them? Yeah,
casual is perfect.
“I can do casual.”
“Good, good. Glad we're on the same page.” She grins. “So, where are
we headed now?”
“Dinner, if you'd like.”
“Oh good.” She pats her stomach, which I'm pretty sure I heard growl a
few minutes ago. “I was hoping you'd say that. I'm starving. Where are we
going?”
I grin. “It's a surprise.”
“I should have known.”
“You just have to keep an open mind and maybe keep those dangerous
shin-kickers to yourself.”
She narrows her eyes but doesn't say anything as I guide her toward my
sleek, dark gray Audi S8. I notice the surprise in her gaze when she sees it,
but really it's nothing too extravagant, not compared to what most guys on
the team drive.
“What happened to your SUV?”
“It's still in the shop. I'm having it repainted and reupholstered.”
“Oh.” She eyes the car again. “And here I thought my paid-off Honda
was badass,” she mutters as I help her in. “I feel underdressed for this.”
I laugh. “For riding in my car?”
“Yes.”
“For what it's worth, I find your paid-off Honda to be very badass.”
“You do?”
“Yes. You worked hard for it, and in my book, that's the very definition
of badass.”
A smile lights her face as I gently shut the door, then round the car,
hopping in behind the wheel.
We make small talk as I navigate the downtown area. And by small talk,
I mean Harper mostly just googles my car, telling me all about it. Her
excitement is adorable, and by the time I'm pulling into yet another parking
garage, she's already planned how much money she needs to make a year to
be able to afford one of her own.
If it keeps her smiling like she is now, I'll buy her one today.
But I'm not going to tell her that because I shouldn't be thinking that.
What the hell is wrong with me?
I shake myself from my thoughts and help her from the car. She gives
me that same dopey grin. It makes me angry and causes something to flutter
in my chest all at the same time.
I ignore both reactions and smile back.
“Keep that grin in place.”
She drops it, her beautiful white-blue eyes narrowing. “Why.”
It doesn't come out as a question and I just smile brighter, leading her
toward our destination.
When we stop in front of a nondescript door, she eyes me cautiously.
“Why do I get the feeling I do not want to go in there right now?”
“I don't know what you mean.”
“Collin…”
“Come on. There's food waiting.”
That seems to kick her into gear.
We walk through the doors into the dimly lit building. It's a quiet place
that serves a little of everything. Nothing too fancy and nothing too plain.
There's music thumping through the speakers as we're guided toward a
table. Our server takes our drink order, then promises to be back shortly.
“What is this place?”
“It's dinner. And a show.”
She quirks a brow. “What kind of show?”
“The fun kind.”
Her lips form a grim line, and I can't help but laugh.
“Open mind.”
The server reappears, drinks in hand.
“All right, what can I get for you to enjoy with tonight's
entertainment?” They shimmy their shoulders, the fringe on their cowgirlinspired shirt shaking.
“I'll have the sampler platter and a basket of fries,” Harper tells them.
“Then whatever he's having.”
“Burger, please. Rare. No veggies. Lots of fries if I could.”
“Sure thing, sugars. I'll get that order placed and right out for you. Our
entertainment will begin shortly. Just remember to please keep your hands
to yourselves. Tipping is allowed and encouraged.” They wink. “Have fun,
dears.”
“Collin…” Harper starts, staring after our server. “Is this…” She looks
over at me. “Did you bring me to a drag show?”
“No. It's karaoke. You know, in case you wanted to grace the stage with
that wonderful vocal range of yours.”
“You ass!” She laughs. “I knew I shouldn't have told you that story,
Fartknocker!”
“Okay, that's just rude.” She tosses a sugar packet at me. “Hey, no
throwing things!”
“I am not singing.”
“God, I hope not. I hear it's awful.” I grin at her over my beer.
“Are you sure it's just karaoke?”
“Pretty sure, yeah. I looked it up this morning.”
“But…” She looks around. “Maybe you got the date wrong?”
I follow her eyes. The crowd is filled with old and young people alike.
There are people dressed casually, people dressed up, and people…
“Oh. Oh.”
It's so obvious now, looking around. How I missed this when we first
walked in, I'll never know.
She bursts into laughter. “Oh my gosh. You should see your face right
now.”
“I thought… I…”
Harper wipes her eyes. “Do you want to leave?”
“What? No. Why would I?”
“Because this”—she waves a hand around—“is definitely not your
scene.”
“If you think this is my first time around queens, you're wrong.”
“Really?”
“My brother runs an LGBTQ+ safe house. They do drag nights all the
time. I help out around there whenever I'm home.”
Her mouth pops open as she regards me.
“What?” I ask, feeling uncomfortable under her gaze.
“Nothing. You just…surprise me.”
“Good or bad surprise?”
“Good. Very good.”
“Queens, kings, and human beings!” a loud voice booms over the
speakers. “Put your hands together because tonight we are joined by the
amazing, the vivacious, the downright looking-so-damn-good-it-should-beillegal Clitney Spears!”
Harper's mouth drops open. “Did they just say Clitney Spears?”
The lights dim, and all that can be heard is a pair of heels clicking
across the stage.
Then the low thrum of a song—presumably something by Britney
Spears—begins, and the lights come back on one by one, illuminating the
stage. The place goes nuts, screaming and yelling as she begins to sing and
dance.
“Oh my gosh,” Harper says, not taking her eyes off the performer. “This
might be the best night of my life.”
I wish I could say the set was good.
I wish I could say I experienced something new.
But the whole night, my focus is solely on the woman sitting across
from me.
And how I think maybe…maybe she was what I needed all along.
Harper's laugh fills the otherwise quiet hallway. “And then when she landed
on your lap, you about fell out of your chair.”
She slaps at her thighs, laughing harder.
Tonight—which was supposed to be dinner and karaoke—did not go as
I planned. Not just because of the schedule flub, but because one of the
performers fell off the stage and landed on my lap. Her heel came up and
scratched me right above my eyes, slicing the skin open and causing the
show to be put on pause so I could get bandaged.
I'm sure it's already out there on social media somewhere.
Despite the mishaps of the evening, it was still fun. Mostly because
watching Harper enjoy herself so much made me happy.
For the first time in a long time, I forgot all about my troubles
surrounding the game.
Harper stops in front of her door and all her giggles fade away. She
reaches up, running a finger over the cut on my head.
“You're going to get a lot of questions tomorrow, I'm sure.”
“Eh. Let 'em talk.”
She drops her hands, and I can see the second the reality of this moment
settles across her face.
“Well, this is me.”
I tuck my lips together, trying not to laugh at her. “Yes, I do recall that
from when I picked you up here a few hours ago.”
That uncomfortable silence I'm really beginning to hate settles between
us again. She peers up at me, practically wringing her hands in front of her
in anticipation of this moment.
She's waiting for me to kiss her.
She wants me to kiss her.
“Ah, screw it,” she mutters.
She shoves up onto her tiptoes, slips her hands into my hair, and pulls
me to her.
Our mouths collide and I'm stunned.
I don't think in my entire life has a woman ever taken the initiative to
kiss me first.
I wrench my mouth away from her, and she blinks up at me with wide
eyes.
“What the hell are you doing?”
Her mouth pops open, surprised. Embarrassed. “I… I… Oh god. I'm
sorry. I thought…I—”
I back her into the wall, cutting off her words. She lets out a shriek as I
haul her into my arms and her legs lock around my waist like they were
made to be there. I hold her up with one arm, the other sliding into her hair,
my thumb caressing her cheek. Her blue eyes are big and full of shock, and
when I press into her, letting her feel just what she does to me, they widen
even more.
“Did you just steal our first kiss from me?”
A grin curls into the corners of her lips. “I was tired of waiting.”
I shake my head, lowering my head back to hers until our lips are barely
brushing.
“This is how that was supposed to go.”
I slide my lips over hers, gently at first, tasting her slowly and softly.
Her hands slide up my chest, a low moan passing through her, and I
snap.
Gone is the slow and soft. I kiss her hard, my tongue pushing past her
lips, and I'm a fucking goner.
She tastes like the sweet wine she was sipping at dinner. It tastes good.
She tastes good.
I push my hips into her, and another soft moan fills the quiet hallway.
Her hips move, seeking the friction I'm providing. We're humping each
other like a pair of horny teens, and I don't think I ever want to stop.
I brush my fingers under her shirt, needing to feel if her skin is as soft as
it looks. Her hands crash into my hair, pulling me closer and somehow
tugging me away all at the same time.
“Collin…” she says against my lips.
I pull away with reluctance, my breaths coming in sharp and fast like I
just spent a shift out on the ice, and I'd be hard-fucking-pressed to ever
admit it out loud, but this? This is better than anything the ice can give me.
“Come inside.”
She doesn't have to ask me twice.
I slip out the keys I feel in her back pocket and push one into the door.
By some fucking miracle, it works.
I don't move to carry her inside just yet.
A crinkle forms between her brows as she peeks up at me.
“Are you sure?” I ask her. “Because if we walk into your apartment,
there's no turning back. I'm going to fuck you, Harper.”
She gasps at my words, eyes darkening with lust.
“First it'll be hard and fast,” I continue. “Then it'll be soft and slow.
And after that, I won't be done with you. I'll want more.”
She gulps, her fingers flexing in my hair.
“So, I'm asking you, are you sure?”
Her teeth bite into her bottom lip like she's thinking it over, and I want
to pull it free and suck it into my mouth to soothe away the sting.
But I wait.
She needs to make this decision herself.
Finally, it pops free, and the sweetest word ever leaves her lips.
“Yes.”

HARPER
Collin's mouth is on mine before I can even finish saying it.
He pushes open my front door, then slams it closed with his foot, never
once taking his lips off mine.
He pushes me against another wall, and all I can think of is how fucking
hot his muscles have to look under his shirt as he holds me here. I peel the
jacket from his body, needing to feel him.
His hands shove at the cardigan over my shoulders, pushing it away. It
barely hits the floor before his fingers are pushing my top up, sliding
against my overheated skin.
And then my shirt is gone too.
My legs are wrapped around his waist and all I'm wearing is a pair of
jeans and my bra.
Damn am I glad I put a cute one on this morning.
Collin stares down at me, his green eyes taking me in. I can feel every
inch they roam over, branding my skin with the fire inside of them.
“Bedroom,” he chokes out. “Where's your bedroom?”
With a shaky finger, I point at the hallway behind him.
He releases his hold on me, letting my legs drop to the floor.
I almost wish he hadn't because I can't stand right now, I'm trembling
with want so bad.
“Go.”
One word.
It's all he says.
So, I do. I go.
I stumble past him, rushing down the hall to my room.
He's right behind me, that warmth of his I'm really starting to like
enveloping me like a blanket.
When I reach my bedroom, he flicks the light on, and my heart starts to
race.
Lights on? What is he, some kind of maniac?
“I want to see you,” he explains, like he knows I'm internally freaking
out. His hands circle my waist, tugging me back against him.
I feel his erection digging into my back as he picks up my hair and
slides it out of his way. His lips dance across my exposed neck. I don't even
realize he's unhooked my bra until the material begins to slip down my
arms. I let it fall to the floor, acutely aware that I'm half naked and he's
fully dressed.
Normally, I'd be embarrassed to be so exposed in front of someone.
But not with Collin.
Never with Collin.
He cups my breasts, fingers plucking at my hardened nipples.
“I've been wanting to play with these since I saw your profile.”
“You have?” It comes out a pant as he nips at my neck, then drags his
tongue along it.
“Yes.” He leaves one hand on my chest, the other lighting a path down
my stomach and into the top of my jeans. His fingers play at the edge of my
panties. “In one of your photos, you're dressed up, wearing this hot navyblue dress, and your tits are pushed up high.” Another nip. “Too fucking
high. I bet everyone was staring at you that night.”
“Marine Corps Ball,” I tell him as he slips his hand into my underwear
and over my neatly trimmed mound. “Ryan's brother is a Marine.”
I don't know why I tell him that. It doesn't matter.
“Harper?”
“Hmm.”
It's not a question. It's a pure moan as the pad of his finger grazes my
clit.
“Don't talk about other men right now. Not when my hand is on your
pussy.”
I nod and swallow, trying to keep myself standing as he draws slow,
short circles over my swollen bundle of nerves.
I swear I could come right now just from this gentle touch.
The crazy part is I know it's all Collin and not because I haven't been
touched in a long time.
I have no idea how long we stand there, him with one hand on my tit
and one between my legs, but my bet is that it's not long. I'm on the edge of
coming, and I swear, if Collin just applied a bit more pressure and rubbed
just two more circles, I'd explode.
But he doesn't.
He pulls his hand away and I whimper.
He chuckles darkly. “Take your pants off and get on the bed.”
I don't waste a single second. I yank my pants down my legs—leaving
my underwear on—and crawl onto the bed, lying on my back.
Collin stands at the edge of the mattress, staring down at me with
obvious desire in his gaze. He strips his shirt over his head, and those abs
I've spent far too much time staring at are finally on display.
Fuck, he looks incredible. All defined muscle and sharp edges like he's
been chiseled out of stone.
I don't paint often—and certainly not people—but I have the craziest
desire to grab my easel and paintbrush and put this image on a canvas.
One knee lands on the bed, the mattress dipping under his weight.
Slowly, almost too slowly, he makes his way to me.
He fits himself between my legs like that's where he belongs, our bodies
molding together like they've been made to fit. His cock is straining against
his jeans. The material is rough against my skin but still feels so good as he
grinds himself against me.
His lips seal over mine in a searing kiss. I let my hands roam his
muscles, running them across his stomach and around to his back, feeling
the dips and curves and the delicious hardness of him.
Meanwhile his hands are exploring too. His fingers dancing over my
sides, tracing a path of their own. He kisses down my chin, down my neck,
and down to my breasts.
He keeps his eyes on mine as he closes his mouth around a puckered
nipple, sucking it into his mouth expertly. He grazes his teeth over the
sensitive spot, then soothes away the bite with a swirl of his tongue. He
gives the same treatment to the other one, back and forth and back again
until I'm rubbing my pussy against him, needing something to help relieve
the blinding ache between my legs. There's no way he doesn't feel the wet
spot I'm leaving behind.
Understanding what I need, he gives my nipples one last taste, then
drags his mouth down my body, not stopping until he's between my legs.
He nips at the sensitive parts of my thighs, and I can't help but think of
his promise earlier to do just this thing in places nobody would see.
“Do you like these?”
“What?”
“These underwear…” He grazes a knuckle over me and I groan. “Do
you like them?”
“I…yes?” I don't know. I can barely think. I can't even remember what
I'm wearing right now.
“Well, that's too bad, isn't it?”
I hear the material rip and a rush of cool air hits my exposed pussy.
Without warning, his tongue is there, pushing into my folds. He gives
me several long, playful licks, then sucks my clit into his mouth.
I swear I stop breathing.
My whole body quakes as I come harder and faster than I ever have
before.
He doesn't let go. Just keeps licking and sucking at me, draining me.
Bringing me right back to the edge like some magician.
Just when I'm about to come again, he pulls his mouth away.
“Oh my god. I hate you.”
He laughs, crawling back up my body. “Based on the way your cunt was
squeezing my tongue, I highly doubt that.”
Cunt.
It sounds so dirty, the way it rolls off his lips and against mine. It's…oh
god. It's kind of hot.
He presses his mouth to me and I taste myself on his lips…on his
tongue.
I want to cry when he pulls away, but when he pushes off the bed and
stands, then flicks open the button of his jeans, I decide it's okay.
He reaches into his back pocket and retrieves his wallet. He grabs a
condom from inside—I don't want to think about why he has it on the ready
—and tosses it at me.
His hands go to his jeans again and he lifts a brow, waiting.
If he thinks I'm about to stop this, he's wrong.
I want this too damn badly to stop. I want to feel him on top of me…
inside of me. I want to watch him fall over the edge just like I did.
When I don't say anything, he slowly pulls the zipper down, and I don't
take my eyes off him for a second. Not when he pushes his jeans and
underwear off. Not when he crawls back onto the bed, leaning over me on
his knees as he peels open the condom. Not when he rolls the rubber down
his length, stroking himself a few times as his eyes drift to the exposed
place between my legs. And not when he lowers himself on top of me,
wrapping a leg around his waist and lining his cock up with my entrance.
It's only when he slowly slips inside of me on a groan that I close my
eyes and relish the way he feels as he stretches me more than I've ever been
stretched before.
He's big and it hurts, yet it feels so good at the same time.
“Look at me,” he instructs.
I do.
“Fucking Christ,” he mutters, holding himself off me, not daring to
move as I adjust to his size. “You feel amazing. So fucking good. Better
than I imagined.”
“You imagined this?”
“Too many fucking times.”
He gulps once. Twice. And I don't miss the tiny beads of sweat
beginning to form at his temples.
“Collin?”
“Yeah?” It's strained sounding, but I hear him.
“I thought you said hard and fast.”
His eyes snap to mine at my words, and it's like something in him
breaks.
He lets go of all the restraint, going onto his knees, and plows into me
with expertise. I try not to think about how much practice he has compared
to me, how he's likely honed this skill of his as much as his skill on the ice.
He drops his forehead to mine, pushing into me again and again.
“Only you, Harper,” he whispers. “Only you.”
I don't know what he means, but I soak in his words all the same.
I run my hands over his back, pulling him closer as he continues to
pump into me. I love the way his muscles strain against my hands, the way
his body moves on top of mine.
He slides a hand between us, his finger finding my clit, stroking me in
those decadent circles again.
My second orgasm hits me out of nowhere and I fall apart around him.
“Fucking beautiful,” he says, stroking me once more.
Like he was waiting for me all along, he grabs my hips, pounding into
me harder and faster until finally, he stills. His mouth drops open, eyes
screwed shut tightly, head thrown back as he comes.
He collapses onto the bed beside me. My hands are shaking as I lie
there, completely spent.
The only sound in the apartment is our arduous breathing, and I bet if he
tried really hard, Collin could hear the sound of my heart trying to burst out
of my chest.
This is just casual, Harper. Nothing to get attached to.
I just have to keep reminding myself of that.
The morning light reaches across the bedroom and into my eyes, pulling me
from my dream I really don't want to wake up from.
I dreamt I was in bed with Collin. Dreamt he buried his face between
my legs until I came and came. Dreamt he fucked me hard, then slow, then
woke me up with his face between my legs again.
I stretch against my blankets, my body sore and tired.
And that's when it hits me.
Last night wasn't a dream.
All those things happened.
Collin.
I peel my eyes open, searching for him, but his side of the bed is cold,
like it's been empty for some time.
I sit up, looking around the room for any sign of him. His clothes that
were strewn across the floor are gone. The towel he used after a shower—
the one he threw on the floor by the dresser—is nowhere to be found.
He's gone.
I try not to let myself be disappointed by that, because of course he's
gone. I'm sure staying over after sex doesn't scream casual. Besides, it's not
like I expected him to be cooking me breakfast or anything.
He left because I essentially asked him to.
A goodbye would have at least been nice though.
I pull myself out of bed, willing my brain to ignore the aching, and
make my way to the bathroom.
I do my business and hop in the shower, trying to wash away how I'm
feeling right now.
When I finally make my way into the kitchen, I pause.
Sitting on the table is a bright, baby-blue box. There's a piece of paper
next to it.
I feel guilty being upset with him and assuming he left without so much
as an afterthought, but more so I'm mad at myself for even caring so much
because I know I shouldn't.
I reach for the paper, and a grin covers my face before I even read what
it says.
Mornin', gorgeous.
I hope these donuts make up for the fact that I had to bail early. They're
from a local food truck. It's one of my favorite places in the city. I'll take
you in person next time, if you'll let me. Man, do I hope you'll let me.
Col
P.S. Did you know that you sing in your sleep? Your parents were right to
pay you to not try out for American Idol.
I peel open the lid, and sitting inside are two donuts: one glazed and a
chocolate one that's drizzled with white icing.
I go for that one first.
I take a bite and nearly moan.
He remembered.
Hidden inside the cake donut is creme filling, and it reminds me exactly
of a Ding Dong, only more delicious.
I make a cup of coffee—a combination of salted caramel and mocha
syrup—and take the other donut to sit outside on my patio.
I realize then that I don't have Collin's number, so I pull up the
BeeMine app to message him.
HorrorHarper: First, thank you for the donuts. They're
amazing.
HorrorHarper: Second, the answer is yes. You can take me in
person next time.
HorrorHarper: Third, thank you for last night. It was…wow. I
don't even have the words.
HockeyGuy69: I'll gladly take wow.
HorrorHarper: Cocky much?
HockeyGuy69: Confident.
HockeyGuy69: I'm sorry I had to leave early. Morning skate.
It's usually optional on game days, but I kind of needed to be
here.
HorrorHarper: Totally understand. Though I was a bit worried
you had just bailed.
HockeyGuy69: I knew I should have put the donuts on the
pillow. But you're kind of a bed hog, and I didn't want you
rolling over on them.
HorrorHarper: I appreciate that. I mean, I'd have still eaten
them, but thank you.
HockeyGuy69: Someone's already asked about my cut.
HorrorHarper: LOL! What'd you tell them?
HockeyGuy69: The truth. A drag queen beat me up with her
shoe.
HockeyGuy69: They won't stop teasing me.
HorrorHarper: Is it wrong to say I hope it scars? Can you
imagine explaining how you got that scar to your future wife
and kids?
HockeyGuy69: With any luck, I won't have to.
HockeyGuy69: I already can't wait to see you again.
HockeyGuy69: Can I call you later?
HorrorHarper: I'd like that.
I send him my phone number, and my heart flutters when a text comes
through right away.
Collin: In case I didn't make myself clear, last night was WOW
for me too, Harper.
Collin: It's gonna be stuck on repeat in my head all day.
Me: For me too.
Collin: I gotta go. We have some meetings starting.
Collin: Watch my game tonight?
Me: I will.
Collin: See? I knew I'd get you to like hockey.
Me: And all it took was a ding dong…donut.
Collin: *narrows eyes*
Collin: Nothing to do with the orgasms…PLURAL…that I gave
you?
Me: I guess they were rather persuasive.
Collin: That's what I thought.
“Ha! I knew it! You're totally going to be a hockey whore now!”
I glare at Ryan from across the table. “Shh! Keep your voice down.”
I glance around the sports bar we're at, making sure nobody is paying
any attention to us.
When Collin asked me to watch his game and I said yes, I didn't think
about the logistics of it. I don't have cable and couldn't tell you what
channel to even look for a hockey game on, so I enlisted Ryan's help. She
suggested a sports bar.
I think really she just wanted to go out after her night at home nursing
her broken heart over Steven.
“I'm not a hockey whore. I don't even know what that is.”
“I don't either. I don't know if it's a thing. I just can't believe you of all
people are actively seeking out a sport to watch. He must have banged you
good last night.”
“Ryan!”
“What? He did! I saw the way you limped in here.”
I hide my face behind my hands, hoping and praying nobody else is
listening in on this embarrassing conversation.
But the truth is…he did bang me good.
So, so good.
Between sleeping in and getting started on my projects late and not
being able to think about anything other than Collin's hands on my body,
I've been a mess today.
I finally gave up around four and called it a day, soaking in the bath to
relieve the stiffness I've been feeling.
“You're awful,” I tell her as she peels my hands away.
“And you love it. Besides, if I don't tease you, who will?”
Collin.
“Oh god. You're thinking about him again, aren't you?”
“What? Am not.”
“Are too. You're doing that dopey grin thing you do when you think
about him.”
I give her another murderous glare, and she just laughs.
“So, other than the incredible sex, how was it really? Do you want to
see him again…like outside the bedroom?”
That's the thing.
The sex was great, but I think the reason it was so great was because of
how good it felt being around him, how easy it was.
I think any other guy I've ever dated would have run the moment they
found out they accidentally took their date to a drag show. And they
certainly wouldn't have been spending whatever little free time they had at
an animal shelter. They wouldn't have held the doors open for me and
helped me into their car. They wouldn't have made me laugh until I nearly
peed my pants.
With Collin, it feels different.
“It was really good,” I tell Ryan. “Almost too good.”
“Too good?”
“Yeah. Like you know when you go see a movie and everything about it
is perfect. The meet cute, the music, the background stories…you love it all.
But then you get home and you read the reviews and see all the little things
you missed and it totally ruins the movie for you? That's what it's like with
Collin. It's perfect and I'm just waiting for the reviews to roll in to find out
that he's not as great as he seems.”
“Okay, okay. I hear what you're saying…” She leans her elbows on the
table. “But what if it is? What if it is that good and that perfect?”
“That's not possible.”
She frowns. “Isn't it though? I mean, look at Goldie Hawn and Kurt
Russell. They're not even married and they're thriving.”
“They were the exception. And besides, you're just saying that because
you're a total hopeless romantic and you're hoping we're going to have
some epic love story.”
Her lips curve upward. “That's true. I am. But maybe I'm right this
time.”
“You're not. It's just casual.”
“He said that?”
“We both did.”
“Hmm. Interesting.”
“Why is it so interesting?”
“Nothing,” she says, then points to the TV. “Look, your man is back
on.”
I let her have her not-so-subtle attempt to distract me from our
conversation, mostly because I actually do find myself wanting to watch
Collin play.
But I don't forget her comment all night long.
Not when the Comets win and Collin calls me after the game, asking to
come over.
Not when he strips me out of my clothes and lays me down on the bed,
sliding into me slowly.
And not when I fall asleep thinking just maybe…we could be something
more.

COLLIN
It's still early in the season and I'm not trying to jinx anything, but we are
already on fire. We're on a six-game winning streak, and out of those six
games, I've put up a point in all but one.
Coach is happy with me. Shep is happy with me. And Colter is finally
off my fucking back.
I don't know if it's just the superstitious hockey player in me, but I can't
help but think it's all Harper that has this good mojo flowing.
I think she might be my good luck charm.
“Col, man. That goal was sick. You going out to celebrate?” Rhodes
asks, dropping onto the bench next to me. “Hear there are some sick drag
clubs here.”
We just wrapped up a win in Vegas and we don't leave until tomorrow
morning, so some of the guys are going out for a celebratory drink and
general debauchery.
I roll my eyes at him. “Nah. I'm good. I'm gonna—”
“Call your girl?”
“She's not my girl.”
“Dude, come on.” He gives me a look. “You call her every night we're
on the road, and every night we're not, you're over at her place. Face it—
she's your girl.”
“No.” I shake my head. “It's casual.”
That's what we agreed on. Keep it simple and easy. Since my focus
needs to be on keeping my numbers up and winning games, I'm perfectly
fine with that.
“Uh-huh. Whatever you say.”
His tone says he doesn't agree, but he pats me on the back and leaves
me to finish undressing anyway.
I hit the showers real quick and change back into my suit just in time to
catch the bus. It's a quick ride back to the hotel, and most of the guys drop
off their crap and head back out. I stay in, order some dinner, and flop back
onto my bed, phone to my ear as I dial Harper.
It's late there, but I know she'll be awake. No matter how many times I
tell her she doesn't need to stay up to see the games, especially the ones
across time zones, she just laughs.
I don't think she's ready to admit it, but she's totally addicted to hockey.
“Hello?”
“Hey,” I say through a grin when her soft, smooth voice hits me.
“Please tell me you saw that goal.”
“From Colter? Yeah, it was pretty sweet.”
A growl vibrates through my chest, and she laughs.
“Yes, Collin, I saw your goal. It was a beauty.”
“A beauty, huh? Someone has been brushing up on their hockey lingo, I
see.”
“I might have googled a few things the announcers said. It's like they're
speaking a foreign language sometimes.”
“You pick up on it fast.”
“I'm learning that. So, other than a beauty of a goal”—I swear I can
hear her smile—“how was your night?”
“Same shit, different city. Just ordered some room service, planning on
watching something on TV. But enough about me. How was your day?”
“Long.” She sighs, and I imagine she's sitting on her couch, a wineglass
in her hand. “But I got three new orders in today, so that makes me and my
bank account very happy.”
“Am I ever going to get to see your studio?”
“Nope.” She pops the P loudly.
Last time I was over there, I tried to go inside to see what it is she does,
but she locked the door on me. I don't know why she's so self-conscious
about it. Clearly she's talented if she's making a living doing it.
But I'll let her have it for now.
“So, whatcha wearing?”
She barks out a laugh at my sudden change in subject. “Wow. Very
subtle.”
“That doesn't answer my question.”
“No, I guess it doesn't.”
I hear water, and I sit up in bed. “Are you in the tub?”
“Maybe.” She drags the word out teasingly.
I groan. “You're evil, you know that?”
“You say that like you didn't just see me two nights ago.”
“It wasn't enough.”
“You just like getting laid regularly.”
“And spending time with you.”
A knock sounds at my door and I get up, letting the room service in. I
give the guy a tip and thank him for bringing it up so late.
When I've settled back onto the bed, I notice that Harper hasn't
responded yet.
“You still there?” I ask.
“Yeah.”
“You do know it's not just about the sex, right? You know I like
spending time with you, yeah? Because in case I haven't said it enough, I
like you, Harper.”
“I like you too, Collin.”
“Enough to show me your titties?”
She laughs. “You just said it wasn't all about the sex.”
“And I meant it. But right now, my dick is straining against my pants
thinking about you naked in the tub, and I'd really, really like to see your
tits.”
A beep sounds in my ear, and I pull the phone away.
I grin and hit accept on the incoming FaceTime call.
A bubble-covered Harper fills the screen, and it hits me just how much
the words I said before are true.
I like spending time with her, and seeing her now, I miss her.
Not just the sex but her.
I'm not used to missing people.
“Hi.”
Her cheeks turn pink at the simple word. She props the phone up on
something and settles back against the tub. “Hi.”
“Anyone ever tell you that you're kind of cute, Harper?”
She rolls her eyes. “Anyone ever tell you that you're kind of annoying?”
“I seem to recall being called that before.”
She shifts around in the tub, and the boob gods must be on my side
today, because I definitely see nipple.
“Did you just flash me on purpose?”
“Oh. Did I do that?” A wicked grin curves her lips. “My bad.”
“You're killing me.”
“Am I?”
“Yes. I wish I were there right now.”
“I do too.”
“How much?”
“So much.”
“Can…can we try something?”
She nods slowly.
I scoot back on my bed until my back rests against the headboard. I prop
the phone against the lamp and pull my shirt over my head, leaving me in
nothing but a pair of jeans.
I settle in on the mattress, picking up the phone and looking into the
camera just in time to see Harper's tongue roll over her bottom lip.
“Are you liking what you see?”
“Yes.” There's no hesitation in her answer. “Very much so.”
“What would you do if you were here now?”
“I'd probably run my tongue over your abs.” The pink on her cheeks
deepens. “I've been wanting to do that for a long time now.”
“Is that so?” She nods. “I'd let you, ya know. All you have to do is ask.”
“I know.” The words come out as a whisper.
“Can I see more of you?”
Her eyes darken and she pushes whatever the phone is resting against
back until more of her comes into view.
She drags a leg up, spreading her legs, but all of her good parts are still
hidden by the bubbles.
She looks gorgeous resting there. The hot water has her skin glistening
and her hair is twisted up in a bun, a few strands hanging down, framing her
face just right. Right now, she's the epitome of every teenage fantasy I ever
had about catching a hot chick in the tub.
“Fuck,” I mutter, and she grins. “You look incredible right now. A wet
dream come to life.”
She drags her fingertips over the tops of her breasts, teasing herself and
me.
“Are you wet right now?”
She giggles. “Depends on your definition of wet.”
“Your cunt, Harper.” She gasps, and just like that, her laughter is gone.
“Is your cunt wet for me?”
She swallows audibly and her hand slides over her tits beneath the
bubbles, right between her legs.
I know the moment she makes contact with her pussy, her eyelids
fluttering shut for only a moment.
“Yes,” she mutters.
“Good. Touch yourself. Tell me how you feel.”
“Wet.” Her teeth sink into her bottom lip as she moves her hand. “Soft.”
I slide the zipper of my jeans down, the sound almost deafening in the
quiet of the room.
She pauses but I nod at her, encouraging her to keep going as I free
myself from my pants.
My cock is throbbing and I want to jerk off so fucking badly, but I
refrain.
The water sloshes around her as she continues her ministrations.
“What else, Harper? What else does it feel like? What do your fingers
feel like on your pussy?”
“Good,” she says quietly. “But not as good as it feels when it's you.”
“It is me,” I tell her. “I'm there and I'm slipping a finger inside of you.”
Her mouth drops open as she does just that.
“I'm sliding it in and out…but slowly. Almost painfully slow, making
sure that the edge of my thumb is brushing against your clit with each
steady stroke.”
She plays with herself, her eyes trying to fall closed with each pass she
makes inside of what is quickly becoming my favorite spot.
“I add another finger, Harper, but I don't pick up my pace.”
She adds a second finger, that damned bottom lip of hers being
tormented by her teeth again as she stretches herself.
Holy hell, she looks gorgeous. Her head is thrown back as she fights to
keep her eyes open with her fingers buried inside herself.
I reach for my leaking cock, swiping my fingers through the pre-cum
and using it as lubrication as I begin to lazily jack myself.
I swear she adds another finger without my instruction, and when I ask
if she has, all she can do is moan.
Her eyes are closed now, breaths coming in sharp. She's close, and
surprisingly, so am I.
“Get there,” I tell her. “I'm right behind you.”
She slips her other hand into the water, and I know she's rubbing circles
on her clit.
I pick up my pace, and just as she begins to cry out, I follow her right
over the edge in a sticky mess.
I don't know how long our labored breathing fills the room, but it's long
enough that I worry she might have fallen asleep. Her eyes are closed, head
resting on the side of the tub.
“You awake still?”
A smile pulls at her lips. “Mmm.”
I chuckle. “Get out of the tub before you really fall asleep and drown
yourself. I'd rather not have your ghost haunting me forever because I
phone-sexed you to death.”
“What a way to go though.”
Can't argue with that.
“I'm gonna get in the shower,” I tell her. “I have…a situation on my
hands. Literally.”
She wrinkles her nose, still not opening her eyes. “Ew.”
“You're telling me. Text me when you get out so I know you didn't
drown, okay?”
“I promise.”
She looks so sweet lying there all sated and happy.
I wish I were there with her.
I miss you.
It's on the tip of my tongue, but I can't make myself say it because
something tells me Harper won't like it.
So instead, I hold it in.
“Good night, Harper.”
“Night, Wright.”
I hop into the shower, then scarf down my cold pasta from room
service.
Just as I'm pulling down the covers to slip into bed, my phone vibrates
against the bedside table.
Harper: Don't worry. I didn't drown. Looks like you won't be
haunted by the masturbation ghost…for now.
Harper: P.S. Thank you. I needed that.
Me: Just something to tide you over, you corn dog.
Harper: Did you just call me a corn dog?
Harper: Dammit. Now I want a corn dog.
Me: I meant HORN dog. It autocorrected.
Me: I promise to buy you a corn dog when I get back.
Me: Now go to bed. It's late there.
Harper: Yes, sir.
Harper: OH! *new kink unlocked*
Me: See? Total corn dog.
“I don't know whether to be completely annoyed or impressed.” Ryan's
eyes flit between us. “You two did plan this, right?”
“No,” we say in unison, which makes this whole situation even funnier.
“Right. Yeah. Totally buying that.” She points toward the bar Lowell
has set up. “I'll be over there if you two dweebs need me.”
Ryan struts over to the bar, sliding up next to Rhodes. He peers down at
her. She says something to him, and that frown that's always lining his
features deepens, then he stomps away.
Huh.
“You know,” Harper says, pulling my attention. “I think she's just mad
she understands our costumes.”
We weren't lying. We didn't plan it.
But when Harper opened her door dressed as Laurie Strode in a blonde
wig, a pair of flared jeans, and a blue button-up complete with a rip in the
sleeve, me standing there dressed as Michael Myers felt like fate.
“Probably.”
I grab her hand and pull her through the costume party Lowell has been
putting on for the team since he became captain. Kids are to be left at home,
and drunkenness is encouraged. We try to do it as close to Halloween as our
schedule allows, and it's always a blast—sometimes probably too much of
one even.
I expect tonight to be no different, especially since we won our seventh
game in a row last night.
When we reach a non-crowded spot in the house, I settle onto an empty
chair, pulling her into my lap.
“Got a question for you,” I say, peeling off my mask and running a hand
through my hair.
Harper pouts. “You looked cuter before.”
“I'm going to pretend you didn't say that.”
She rolls her eyes. “What's your question?”
“What did you do with the stick I gave you at the home opener?”
She sucks in air through her teeth, scrunching up her face. “Uh…I kind
of…gave it away?”
“You did or didn't? Because that sounded like a question.”
“I did.” Another wince. “I was mad at you and I didn't really know what
to do with it, so I just handed it to some kid.”
“Did you happen to look at the stick at all?”
“I mean, kind of? But not closely. Why?”
“I wrote my phone number on it.”
Her eyes widen and she covers her mouth with her hand. “No.”
“Yes. And guess who called me this morning? Jonathan Lucas Kyler,
age 8. He's in Miss McCarthy's class and he's going to be a defenseman in
the NHL one day.”
She laughs. “Stop it.”
“Oh, there's more. He prefers cats to dogs—we had a long chat about
why he was wrong on that one—and he loves jalapeños on his pizza. He
doesn't like ketchup—another blasphemous thing—and his favorite cartoon
is Adventure Time.”
“He sounds a little misguided, but adorable nonetheless.”
“We have a training session scheduled for next week. He's offered to
teach me a few things that I apparently need help on.”
Her shoulders shake. “Oh my gosh. I'm so sorry. I had no idea you
wrote your number on it.”
I shrug. “It's fine. The kid's a hoot. Maybe he can help teach me a few
things.”
“Please. You're an amazing player. You don't need any help.”
“You should have seen me at the start of the season. I was all out of
whack.”
“Really? What happened?”
I squeeze her hip. “You did. You're my good luck charm.”
“I am not.”
“Are too.”
She looks like she wants to argue but thinks better of it.
Instead, she looks out at the party, taking it all in.
“I can't believe the captain just opens his home up to everyone like
this.”
“Oh, he doesn't. This isn't his place. He's just renting it. Lowell is super
private. Most of the team doesn't even know where he lives.”
“Seriously?”
I nod. “Yeah. He had some…issues before. A relationship gone sour. He
really took a step back after everything went down.”
“Well, good for him for putting up boundaries. It sucks to be hurt by the
people you love.”
She sounds like she's speaking from experience and I want to press, but
we're interrupted.
“I don't think we've officially met yet,” Miller says to Harper. “I'm
Grady.”
Harper glances at me as if to check to see if he's cool. I nod.
“Nice to meet you, Grady.”
“I like your costume. Laurie Strode, right?”
“Yes. Are you a fan?”
“Oh hell yeah. Jamie Lee Curtis was looking hot back then. Hell, she's
hot now too. Like in those commercials for that yogurt that makes you
shit.”
“Helps you shit. Doesn't make you shit,” I tell him.
“Eh. Same thing.” He takes a sip of what I hope is water because he's
not exactly the best at holding his liquor. “Why are you two hiding out over
here? I think they're going to set up a game of poker in the basement.”
“Does Lowell know that?”
His silence tells me it's a no.
Whatever. I'll let him deal with it. He's the one in charge of all these
idiots, not me.
“So, uh, Harper…saw you brought a friend with you.”
She rolls her lips together. “I did.”
“Is, uh, she single?”
Harper shakes her hand. “Sorta.”
“Wanna help a guy out?”
I groan. “Jesus, Miller. You can't ask my date to be your wingman.”
“No, it's okay,” Harper says. “I'll help you out. If you can find her, tell
her you think Grease is better than Grease 2.”
“What's Grease?”
“A movie. Don't worry, she'll tell you all about it.”
“All right. Thank you.”
He takes off excitedly, a new pep in his step.
“You just sent him to the wolves, didn't you?”
“Oh, certainly. Ryan would eat him alive.”
“He's a good kid. Hell of a player too. Just a little…”
“Desperate?”
I laugh. “You said it, not me.”
“Speaking of desperate…” She leans into me. “I think someone owes
me a corn dog.”
“Did you just refer to my dick as a corn dog?”
“What? No!” She tosses her head back. “Oh god. That did sound like
that, didn't it? I literally meant a corn dog. I am starving and those
appetizers are just not doing it. I'm desperate for real food.”
I place my hand on her stomach. “I swear this thing is a bottomless pit.”
“It really is. And I'm sure all this food will catch up to me one day—
and hopefully go straight to my ass—but until then, I'm going to enjoy it
and eat until I burst.”
“First of all, I think your ass is just perfect.” I slip my hand over it,
giving it a squeeze. “Second, let's get out of here. There's a place I know
that serves fair food all year long.”
“Seriously? Like funnel cakes and root beer floats?”
I swipe at the corner of her lip. “You're drooling.”
“Shut up.” She swats at me. “And lead the way.”
She pushes off my lap and pulls at me to get up too. I grab her hand and
lead her back through the house the way we came.
There are even more people inside than before, but it's like this every
year. What starts as a party for the team and their spouses always turns into
a full-blown rager.
Harper tugs on my hand, and I look back at her.
“I need to tell Ryan I'm leaving,” she says into my ear so I can hear her
over the thumping music. She points toward the corner of the living room
where Ryan is sitting, talking animatedly. Miller's next to her, and he looks
like he's about to hurl. I'm not sure if it's the alcohol I'm almost positive he
was drinking or if it's from Ryan laying into him.
Harper makes her way through the throngs of people and I hang back,
crossing my arms over my chest, keeping an eye on her. She looks adorably
tiny weaving around the tall players, but what's funny is that I'm not sure
any of them would be able to actually handle her.
“Huh.”
I turn toward the voice coming from my left.
Lowell's standing there, a red Solo cup lifted to his lips.
“Huh what?” I ask.
“You're smitten.”
“Bullshit.”
“Oh, no, dude. You are definitely smitten,” Rhodes backs him up,
appearing on my right out of nowhere. “It's all over your face. You're
totally into her.”
“Of course I'm into her. I wouldn't be here with her if I wasn't.”
“Yeah, but you're really into her,” Lowell says.
“Maybe even in love,” Rhodes adds.
Me? In love with Harper?
No. Not a chance.
“It's casual,” I say for what feels like the millionth time.
“That's what they all say.” Lowell sighs. “Then one day they're madly
in love and shopping for a ring.”
“Then planning a wedding and picking out names for a baby.”
Harper and Ryan put their heads together, and Miller takes his chance to
slink away by literally sliding to the floor and crawling from their view.
Neither of the girls notice. They're too busy whispering about
something. Harper points my way and Ryan looks over. She grins, then
humps the air repeatedly and says something that makes her friend blush.
Harper looks exasperated and shakes her head, but even from here I can
see the hint of desire pulling at her features.
Whatever Ryan said, Harper doesn't think it's a bad idea.
And whatever it is, I don't think it is either.
I cannot wait to get her back to my place and show her just how much I
missed her over the last few days. I have half a mind to march over there,
toss her over my shoulder, and carry her out of the party right now.
“There's that face again,” Lowell comments.
I feel my face pull into a scowl. “I am not in love with her.”
“Methinks the dick doth protest too much,” Rhodes mocks.
“Yes, yes. There has been a disturbance in the Force for sure.”
“You two are fuckin' nerds.”
They don't disagree with me.
“It's not love,” I insist. “We're just fooling around. Nothing serious. It's
for the team.”
They both lean around me, looking at one another.
Lowell's hand lands on my shoulder. “Right.”
“Sure thing there, bud.” Rhodes pats my other side.
“I fucking hate you both,” I mutter, shaking them off.
The girls make their way back over to me, a soft grin playing at the
edges of Harper's lips as they approach.
“Heard you're taking my friend home,” Ryan says to me. “You gonna
bring her back walking crooked again?”
“Ryan!” Harper chides like I'm sure she's done a hundred times before.
“That's the plan.”
“Collin! Oh my god.” Harper hides her face in her hands.
“Good. That's what I like to hear.” Ryan turns her attention to Lowell.
“I heard there's a poker tournament in the basement. Wanna go hustle some
chumps with me?”
“Fucking hell. Are they gambling again?”
“Oh, yeah, forgot to tell you,” I say to him.
“Shit.” He runs a hand down his face. “Last time they did this, a brawl
broke out and we ended up with two players injured. I think somebody still
owes someone else money too. Coach was pissed.”
“So is that a yes on the hustling, then?”
“Eh.” Lowell shrugs. “Why not? If they're going to get me in trouble,
might as well take their money and make it worth it.”
He holds his arm out to her, and she hooks her hand around it.
“Text me all the dirty details,” she says to Harper.
Rhodes watches them leave, his perpetual sullen stare even more
pronounced as they disappear into the crowd.
“I'm heading out,” he announces. “Don't text me the dirty details.”
Then he rakes his eyes over Harper. “Or maybe do.”
I step toward him, snarling in warning.
He laughs, shaking his head as he backs away. “Told you so.”
“What'd he tell you?” Harper asks once he's gone.
“It's nothing.” I hold my hand out to her. “Come on. I'm suddenly
starving too.”
The way her eyes flare tells me she knows exactly what I mean.

HARPER
I was right about Collin's apartment being swanky.
We're still in the lobby, but just from the decor and marble flooring, I
can already tell whatever awaits us is going to blow my mind.
“Evening, Mr. Wright.”
“Hey, Beau. How goes it?”
“Doing well, sir. I see you have a guest this evening.” The old man
bounces his brows suggestively, and I have a hard time holding back my
laugh. “Quite a beauty, too.”
I'm suddenly glad we decided to change out of our costumes before
grabbing food. Since Halloween was several days ago, we decided not
scaring everyone would be best, especially with how recognizable Collin is.
“Are you hitting on my girl, Beau?”
He grabs his chest. “I wouldn't dare, sir.” He throws a wink my way.
“Besides, Meghan would likely hold a pillow over my head if I even
thought about stepping out.”
“Oh, she definitely would.” Collin waves a hand between me and the
old man. “Harper, meet Beau. He may look old, but he's a spry fella.”
Beau sticks his chest out proudly. “That's right I am.”
I grin, sticking my hand out. “Pleasure to meet you, Beau.”
He grabs my hand in his old, wrinkled one and brings it to his lips. “I
assure you, the pleasure is all mine.”
“I'm telling you, I got Meghan on speed dial.”
“Oh, all right.” Beau sighs, dropping my hand. “I get it, I get it.”
I smile at their banter, loving their playfulness.
Something I've noticed about Collin is that he takes the time to get to
know everyone he talks to. He learns their names and asks them questions.
He doesn't brush anyone off like they are beneath him just because he's a
famous hockey player.
It's…sweet.
“Here.” Collin hands him an Oatmeal Creme Pie he picked up at Fair
Foods. “Keep those paws off my gal and there will be more where those
came from.”
Beau looks at the pie, then at me. “I'm sorry, dear, but this is my first
love. My heart belongs to Miss Little Debbie. And Meghan!” he adds. “Her
too.”
I laugh. “That's all right. Collin here is about all I can handle anyway.”
Beau leans in close. “He's quite the shithead, huh?”
“Speed dial, Beau. Speed dial.”
The old man sends me a wink, then presses the button for our elevator.
We step in, and even this space is extravagant, smooth, relaxing jazz
playing over the speakers.
We don't speak on the ride to the twentieth floor—which is surprisingly
fast—and I think it's because we're both too keyed up over what's to come.
When Collin slides his keycard—because a regular key is just too plain
apparently—into the door, my knees begin to shake.
I have no idea why. It's not like we haven't done this before.
But there's something different about tonight.
Something that feels more…real.
I don't know if it's because we spent the evening with his team or what,
but there's definitely been some sort of shift between us since we left the
party.
It makes me uneasy in both a good and bad way.
Good because there's a small part of me that wouldn't mind more with
Collin.
Bad because…well, I'm terrified of giving him more. More will only
lead to heartbreak. I'm sure of it.
He pushes open the door and a light kicks on the moment Collin steps
into the darkened doorway.
“All the lights are automatic,” he explains.
I try to rein in my shock but apparently fail as he laughs.
“I came from a three-bedroom farmhouse that was built pre-plumbing.
Believe me, I was shocked too when the real estate agent showed me this
place.”
I step into the hallway, and the first thing I notice is there's nothing in it.
Not a shoe rack or a closet. There's nothing.
“Come on,” Collin encourages, motioning with his head.
I follow behind him as he leads me farther into the apartment.
When we reach the end of the hall, everything opens up. What few
walls there are have been painted a light gray, and the theme is minimalism.
The first thing I notice is the size. I swear you could fit two of my
apartments just inside this space.
The craziest part is there's a whole other level.
The second thing I notice? The windows. They're tall, taking up most of
the perimeter. I walk toward them, looking out. We're high up, and with the
clear sky tonight, it feels like we're floating.
“I'm still me,” he reminds me, coming up behind me.
“This view…it's breathtaking.”
“Yes, it is.”
But I can see in the reflection that he's not looking out at the night sky
at all.
He's looking at me.
His hands come to rest on my waist, and he tugs me back against him.
“It's too bad you took your costume off,” I say, leaning into him.
“Why's that?”
“Because I could have made an Is that a knife you're holding or are you
just happy to see me joke.”
He chuckles, grinding his erection against my ass, burying his face in
my hair. “Oh, I am very happy to see you. I can assure you of that.”
“So it seems.”
I try to turn in his arms, but he doesn't let me.
Instead, he crowds me against the cold window, runs his hands along
the length of my arms, and picks them up, resting my palms against the
glass.
“Keep them there.” He drags his fingertips back over my arms and
down my sides until he hits my waist again. Slowly, he inches the fabric up,
bunching it in his hands. “I'm so fucking glad you brought a dress.”
I packed it to wear tomorrow, but it ended up coming in handy tonight.
Right now, with Collin's hands sliding the fabric up my body, I'm not mad
about that at all.
Cool air rushes against me, my dress now completely gathered at my
hips.
His fingers hook into my panties.
“Don't you dare rip them.”
A low, rumbly laugh leaves him. “Yes, ma'am.” He dips his lips to my
ear. “Oh. New kink unlocked.”
A laugh bubbles out of me, but it quickly transforms into a moan when
he nips at that spot just below my ear.
“I love the way you taste.” Another bite. A lick. His fingers tighten on
my hips, digging into me, almost bruising.
He drops to his knees, dragging the lace panties down my legs until I
step out of them.
I have no idea what he does with them, and I don't care. Not when his
hands are on me, pulling me closer until my back is arched, my cheek still
pressed against the window.
He shoves my dress back around my waist, leaving me exposed to him
completely.
“Hold your dress up,” he instructs, and I listen, grasping the material in
one hand. His hands roam over my bottom, a single finger tracing down the
middle. “Beautiful.”
He places a gentle kiss against my lower back as he reaches around, his
finger finding my clit.
I suck in a sharp breath at the contact. I'm already teetering on the edge
of hanging on.
He kisses me again. Then another and another. Lower, more brazen as
he continues to rub circles against my very swollen nub.
Suddenly he stands, and the sounds of him undoing his pants fill the air.
He doesn't once take his finger off my clit, not even when he pushes the
blunt head of his cock against me. He's careful not to push into me because
we're both aware he's not wearing a condom, but suddenly I need to feel
him bare.
I push against him, an invitation.
“Please.”
I don't have to tell him twice.
He thrusts into me like we have all the time in the world—slowly and
softly, relishing the way it feels to have him be inside me with nothing
between us.
Once he's buried to the hilt, he begins to pump into me in short, slow
strokes.
The roughness of his jeans brushing against my legs feels like a whole
different sensation. It feels naughty to be fucking fully clothed.
“Too good.” He gathers my loose hair in his free hand, pulling it just
tight enough that it stings. “Just too fucking good.”
His lips find my neck and he trails kisses all over me, still sliding slowly
into me.
“I could get used to this,” he murmurs into my ear.
Me too.
So used to it that it scares me. Makes my heart ache with yearning.
But I don't tell him that.
I can't.
I squeeze my eyes shut tightly, blocking out the thoughts as he adds
another finger to my clit, his touch growing firmer, just like his strokes.
Our breaths are coming in sharp, the window fogging up with the heat
coming from our bodies.
We're both close.
When he abandons my hair in favor of pressing his thumb against my
asshole, everything that's been building inside of me breaks and I come
with a force I've never experienced before.
Collin pulls out, grabbing my hips and spilling himself across my lower
back, like he's claiming me.
He drops his forehead between my shoulder blades as we take in
labored breaths, his fingers flexing and relaxing on my hips over and over
again.
“You're a beautiful woman, Harper,” he says quietly. “But you're even
more stunning after I've marked you.”
He spins me in his arms and crashes his mouth to mine.
I don't know how long we stand there kissing, but at some point he
sweeps me into his arms, carrying me into the shower…where we do it all
over again.
After morning skate—because the Comets have a game tonight—Collin
lures me out of his bed with the promise of donuts.
When we arrive at the hidden gem—Scout's Sweets—my eyes nearly
pop out of my head at the line. It's at least ten deep. At noon.
The food truck is painted a bright blue, matching the box of donuts
Collin brought me. There are a few tables set up outside and a small
bookshelf to the left of the truck. It's cute and inviting.
“Holy crap,” I whisper. “This is insane.”
“It is, but it's so worth it.”
“We don't have to wait in this line,” I tell him. “We can just go to Dee
Dee's or something.”
He cuts a sharp look my way. “Bite your tongue, woman.”
I'm about to make a snarky, inappropriate comment when a young kid
comes strolling up to us.
“Hey, mister,” he says, pulling on Collin's jacket, tipping his little head
back to look at him. “You're that hockey guy ain'tcha?”
Collin grins. “Depends. Are you a Comets fan?”
The little kid puffs his chest out. “Sure am.”
“Oh my gosh,” says a woman a few people in front of us, turning to
look. When she spots the kid standing by Collin, she darts our way. Collin
holds his hand up to her, letting her know it's fine.
“Then, yeah, I'm that hockey guy.” He crouches down until he's eye
level with the little munchkin who can't be more than five. “Collin Wright
is the name. What's yours?”
“Jefferson.”
“Jefferson, huh?”
“Yup.” He bobs his head. “But all my friends call me Jeff. Since my
mama said you and I can't be friends, I guess you gotta call me Jefferson.”
“I can't be your friend? Why not?”
He hooks his thumbs into his belt loops and kicks at the rocks on the
ground. “She said you're too famous and you ain't got no time for bad kids
like me who don't clean their rooms.”
Collin looks up at the sky, trying not to laugh at the poor kid. “Well, I
tell you what, if you pinky-promise me that you'll clean your room today
when you get home, I'll be your friend. Heck, I'll be your best friend even.”
Jefferson's eyes light up. “Really? Oh, man. Petey is gonna be so
jealous you're my best friend and not him anymore. He's dumb anyway. He
stole my gum. Can you believe that?”
“Kids, man.”
“Yeah, kids, man,” Jefferson echoes, then he hooks pinkies with Collin.
A few other people in line take notice of their exchange, and it doesn't
take long for a line for him to form too.
He stays cool about it, signing whatever they put in front of him,
making polite conversation, answering their questions.
When we finally make it to the front of the line, I can tell he's tired and
in desperate need of his pre-game nap.
“Hey, Scout,” he says to the woman in the food truck with familiarity.
She gives him a shy smile. “Hey, Col. You want your usual?”
“Please, and whatever Harper here wants.”
The woman looks over at me and I expect to see jealousy in her eyes,
but there's nothing except warmth.
“Hi.” She waves. “I'm Scout. It's great to meet you.”
“Likewise. I've been dying to tell you that your donuts are amazing ever
since Collin brought them to my place.”
“He brought you my donuts?” Surprise laces her voice. I nod and her
eyes shift over to Collin, who gives her a bored expression that I'm not
buying.
“What?” He shrugs. “It's not a big deal.”
“Uh-huh.” She punches a few buttons on the screen, muttering
something I can't quite make out. “What can I get you?”
“I'll take two Ding-a-ling Dongs and a large iced coffee.”
“Sure. Do you want to add any syrups?”
“Do you have lavender?”
“Oh.” Scout clutches her chest. “A girl after my own heart.” She looks
pointedly at Collin. “I like her.”
“Yeah, join the club,” he says, and I don't miss the smile tugging at his
lips.
“If that's all, it'll be eight dollars and seventy-five cents. Want it on your
tab?”
Collin nods. “Please.”
“Sure thing. Give me a few minutes and I'll bring it out.”
We head over to one of the few empty tables, and Collin slides in next
to me instead of across from me.
“So you have a tab here, huh?”
“Don't tell my nutritionist, but yeah.”
“Your secret is safe with me.”
“Keep it that way, yeah? Because I don't want the other guys finding
out about this place and ruining it for me, you know?”
I zip my lips together and throw away the key.
He presses a kiss to my temple. “And that's why I like you.”
“Oh, is that why you like me?”
Heat flashes in his eyes. “Among other reasons.” He brushes his lips
against my ear. “Ones I'll tell you about in great detail later.”
I shiver at his promise, and he laughs.
Another group of young kids catch his attention and I wave him off,
letting him know I'll be fine on my own.
I watch him interact with each person like they're special and have all
of his undivided attention. It's remarkable, really. I have no idea how he's
doing it.
I'm tired for him.
“He's good with them, huh? He gets bombarded a lot when he comes,
and at first, I expected him to just stop showing up, but he never did,” Scout
says, setting our box of donuts and our coffees on the table. “I put some
creamer and sugar packets in the box too. I wasn't sure if you'd need them
or not.”
“Thank you. I appreciate it.”
“Of course.” She slides into the spot across from me. “So, how long
have you and Collin been seeing each other?”
“Uh…”
She waves her hands. “No, you know what—it's totally none of my
business. I'm just nosy and like to keep up with my regulars. None of the
other guys on the team have mentioned you, so I was just curious.”
“Other players come here?”
“Oh, yeah. Several of them do. And for some reason, they all seem to
think they're the only ones who know about this place. It's hilarious to
watch them try to tiptoe around one another.”
“Men are so clueless sometimes.”
She snorts like she knows what I'm talking about a little too well.
“Amen to that.”
“Your question wasn't invasive, by the way. I… Well, the timeline of
things is a little complicated.”
“How so?”
I give her a brief history of how we originally met, then found each
other on the app and once again at the hockey game. By the end of it, she's
shaking her head, pursing her lips in disbelief.
“I should withhold donuts from him. What a total moron.”
“Oh, completely. I was furious at first.” I glance over at him. He's
currently sitting on the ground, his legs stretched out in front of him,
showing the kids something. They're all doing exactly what he's doing.
“But…” I lift a shoulder. “Here I am.”
“I think it's sweet you two fell in love like that. I—oh!” She sits back.
“Wow. Your face just totally changed when I said that. I'm sorry. I
overstepped again.”
I give her a small smile. “It's fine.”
We haven't really talked more about what we're doing. There are
moments when it doesn't feel at all casual, like something else has
blossomed between us and we skipped right over that.
But any time those feelings begin to creep in, I remind myself that
we're just having fun.
Collin has a career to worry about, and I'm not looking for serious. It's
the perfect scenario, really.
She opens her mouth, then slams her lips back together, rolling them in.
“Eh. Who needs labels anyway? You two are adorable together no matter
what.”
“Thank you.”
“I should get back. I have a bunch of things to do before closing up for
the day.” She stands. “I hope you love the donuts. Feel free to tell all your
friends about them.”
“Oh, I definitely will.”
She goes to walk away, then spins toward me again. “Can I say
something else that might be a wee bit over the line?”
“Sure.”
“Collin doesn't bring anyone else here. Like, literally nobody else.
When his family was in town last time, he didn't even bring them. So, take
that however you want.”
That…surprises me.
And I'm also not sure what that means.
Out of all people, why me?
Scout gives me a soft smile. “Hopefully I'll see you around, Harper.”
“You will,” I promise.
She heads back inside her truck and I graze on my breakfast, watching
Collin continue to talk to person after person. I swear, they have to be
calling their friends in at this point, but he's taking it all in stride with the
patience of a saint.
Like he can feel my eyes on him, he peeks over at me and winks.
That same longing feeling from last night returns.
I could get used to this, he said.
And the scariest part of all?
I could get used to it too.

COLLIN
A puck goes soaring down the ice, just out of reach of Rhodes' blade, and
Colorado has iced it. They've been playing this game with us for the last
five minutes, flipping it down the ice any time it comes near them over and
over again, running out the clock.
We're behind by a point, but there's still enough time on the clock to
score again. We know it, and so does Colorado.
Eye contact is made between the players on the ice, and the message is
clear: Don't try anything fancy. Don't try to be the hero. Throw everything
we got at the net.
And that's what we do.
Except an errant pass skips over a blade and then Colorado has
possession and they're flying down the ice…right toward our empty net.
And just like that, our winning streak comes to an end.
With our heads hung low, we skate off the ice, heading to the dressing
room coated in the stench of sweat and defeat.
We were only one win away from beating a franchise record, so this one
stings harder than usual.
So, so close.
“We went out there and gave them hell. Be proud of that.”
Coach's eyes scan the room, landing on each of us for a solid moment
before moving on to the next.
“It's behind us. There's nothing we can change now. We're moving on.”
He claps his hands together. “Let's get on the bus. Get home and get rested.
Got it?”
We all give some form of verbal affirmation and get our asses into gear.
“Hey, man,” Rhodes says from beside me, stripping off his pads. “That
was a sick pass to Miller.”
“Yeah, too bad Colorado picked it off and scored on it.”
“That's on the kid, not you. He should have been there.”
I shrug.
He can say that all he wants, but we both know it's not true.
It was a dangerous pass, a total risk. And the reward was just not there.
It's the middle of November and we're doing fine in the standings,
holding third place with no problem. But I know if we don't keep our
momentum up, we'll slide right to the bottom in no time.
I don't want to be at the bottom. I want to help carry my team to the top,
all the way to the Finals. And this time? I want to fucking win.
“We're just tired, man. Been on the road too long. We have a solid
stretch of home games, and we always play better on our ice.”
“Yeah, sure.”
He's right about part of that. We are tired. We've been on the road for
almost ten days now, one of our longest stretches of the season. The hotel
life isn't the worst thing ever, but it does get old after a while. Wears you
down.
I am more than ready to be back in my own bed again…and have a
certain someone in there with me.
The dressing room is quiet as we shower, gather our gear, and throw our
suits back on for the bus ride to the airport. Sometimes we wait until the
next morning to fly back home, but tonight, after being away for so long,
we're all eager to get back, so we board our flight immediately after the
game.
It's late—or early, depending on how you look at it—when we land
back on the East Coast.
I'm fucking beat. Bone-ass tired. I don't hang around to chat and hop
right in my car, taking off for home so I can get some sleep.
Except I pull into Harper's apartment complex, and it's only then that I
realize what I've done.
I meant to drive home, and I drove to her.
For a long time, I sit in my car trying to figure out just what the hell that
means.
It's not casual, that's for damn sure.
And it's not love because there is no way Lowell and Rhodes are right.
I'm not in love with her.
I can't be. For so many reasons.
This thing we're doing is just supposed to be something to keep my
mind off the game. It's supposed to be fun and easy, no strings. Just
relieving tension. It's for the team.
Besides, if this did mean something—which it doesn't—I can't invest in
someone else right now, not when I don't know if I'll be here next season or
not.
But…I meant to drive home, and I drove to her.
I swallow down that hard truth, and when the clock hits 3 AM, I have a
sinking feeling in my gut that maybe…just maybe…Lowell and Rhodes
were right.
I think I'm in love with Harper.
I'm dressed in a suit every playing day of my life, so I never feel like
they're special attire anymore.
But standing in front of Harper, her jaw dropped and pure, unfiltered
lust in her eyes? Yeah, I'm feeling really damn good right about now.
I smirk down at her. “I told you.”
“Huh?” She slowly—and I mean slowly—drags her eyes up my body
and back to mine.
“That I look good in a suit. I told you so.”
Her tongue slides across her bottom lip as she lets her eyes roam once
again. “Yes, you did.”
“Why do I feel like you're about two seconds away from hauling me
into your apartment and having your way with me?”
She quirks a brow. “Would you complain if I did?”
“Hell no.” She lunges for me, and I sidestep her libido-driven reach.
“But Ryan might.”
“Who?” she feigns.
“Best friend. About yay big.” I hold my hand up about where Ryan
comes to on me. “Fiery and slightly terrifying. AKA, the woman I am
definitely not going to double-cross.”
Harper tosses her head back, whining. “Do we have to go? I hate
peopling.”
“Yes. We have to go.”
“But…sex.” She pouts.
“I thought it wasn't all about sex.”
“You said that, not me. I'm just here for the sex.”
I brush off the sting of her words.
“Come on. Let's go support your friend.”
I pull her out the door, waiting while she locks it, then guide her to the
elevator. When we step in, she peeks up at me.
“You know I was just teasing about the sex thing, right?”
I'm not so sure. “I know.”
“Good. Because I do like you, Collin. I like what we have. It's fun and
there are no expectations. Things are good like this.”
They could be better.
We could be better.
I'm in love with you.
But I don't say any of that.
Instead, I tug her close to me and cover her mouth with my own, hoping
my kiss does the talking for me.
“Okay, so explain it to me again.”
We're standing in front of Ryan's interactive project.
There's a fancy camera set up in front of a plain white background.
Ryan is currently behind the camera, shooting the couple standing before
her.
Harper leans over, pointing a finger at the pair currently in front of the
camera. “See the headphones? You record something in that booth over
there, a message to one another. Something funny, something sweet,
whatever you want. Then, you stand in front of the camera and listen to
them. Ryan will give them a signal of when she's going to turn it on, and
then she just lets the camera capture their reaction. I think her final plan is
to take stills from the footage and print them.”
“Huh,” I say. “So it's just capturing your reaction to hearing
something?”
She nods. “Yes, your initial one. It can say so much about a person, you
know. I bet the photos are going to be stunning.”
“You artsy people are weird.”
She glowers up at me playfully.
“You know we have to do it, right?”
“Really? You want to be part of this human experiment?”
“Sure.” I shrug. “Why the hell not? Besides, I'd love nothing more than
a photograph of your face when I've said something dirty. I'd hang that
right in my living room.”
“You don't have any photos in your living room.”
“Not yet.” I wink.
“Do you really want to do it?”
“Yes, I really want to.”
“All right. I'll tell Ryan.”
The long, deep green dress she's wearing that clings to her curves until
about her knees and then flares out swishes against my leg as she walks
away.
She says something to Ryan, who claps her hands excitedly, then waves
me over.
“Oh my gosh,” she squeals when I approach. “I am so excited you guys
are doing this! I mean, I was going to force you to do it anyway, but I am
thrilled you're volunteering.” She shimmies her shoulders. “All right. So
what you need to do is just go into the booths and record a message. It can
be as short or as long as you'd like. When you're done, just flip the light
switch, and I'll come get you when I'm ready. You'll just stand here and
listen and I'll capture it all. Then you'll go back into the booth while the
other one goes. Sound good?”
“Easy enough.”
Ryan leads us over to the booths. We each take a room, and when the
door clicks shut behind me, there's silence.
It's totally soundproof in here. I can't hear a thing from the showing
outside.
Sitting in the middle of the room is a stool and a tape recorder. There's a
notecard with basic instructions, and that's it.
Nothing else.
I pick up the recorder and sit, waiting for something to hit me.
A few things run through my mind, especially dirty ones because I
wasn't joking about wanting photographic proof of the way her eyes light
up when I say something inappropriate.
But nothing sounds good enough. Nothing sounds right.
So I close my eyes, relax my shoulders, and clear my mind. It's the
same thing I do before every game. I take a moment to breathe, to center
myself.
It takes several seconds to get my head right, and when I do, I lift the
recorder to my mouth and speak from the heart.
“Okay, are you ready?” Ryan asks, her voice muffled but audible through
the noise-canceling headphones.
I give her a thumbs-up.
“All right.” She holds up three fingers. “Three…two…one.”
She hits the play button, and for a long time, nothing happens.
It's silence.
But if I hold my breath and listen closely, I can faintly hear the soft
rustling of Harper's dress as she settles onto the stool.
She must have hit record as she picked it up.
“What the hell am I going to say?”
Her voice comes over the headphones in a whisper, and it's clear she
has no clue she's recording.
“Ugh, I can only imagine what he said. It's probably cunt. Oh, man. I
kind of hope he says cunt. That word really does something to me.”
I chuckle.
“But no,” she continues. “He's probably saying something great.
Something epic. Because that's just who he is. He's perfect.”
She groans, her voice growing louder. I think she's dropped her head
into her hand, her mouth closer to the microphone now.
“Ugh. Why does he have to be so perfect? Why? All the perfect ones
end up being the biggest heartbreakers. I should know. My father was
perfect too. The best dad, the best husband. But none of that mattered
because in the end, he was nothing but a lying, cheating jerk who broke my
mother's heart in the worst kind of way. I mean, what asshole goes out for a
piece of ass in the middle of a snowstorm and gets himself dead? My father,
that's who.”
There's a crackling as she readjusts herself.
“But god…the way he looks at me sometimes. It's like he's peeking into
my soul. Like he sees me in all my awkward glory and actually likes it.
Likes me. It…it feels so good to be wanted like that.”
She sighs heavily.
“I think I upset him earlier when I told him it was just sex for me. It was
a lie. It's not just sex, and it scares me so much. It scares me because I think
maybe he might be falling for me and I…I can't. I can't fall for him. I can't
put myself out there like that. I can't let him be the second man to break my
heart. He's… It's not worth it.”
She exhales sharply.
“Okay, Harper. You can do this. Just say something fun. Tell him he has
a cute ass or something. Yeah, that's what I'll go with.”
Not realizing she was already recording, the air goes dead when she
clicks the button.
I don't move.
I can't.
I thought the worst moment of my life was when the lamp lit up in
overtime in Game Six.
But no.
This is it.
Because the girl I'm in love with? The one I just confessed my feelings
to on that recording she's just minutes away from hearing?
She just told me I'm not worth it.

HARPER
The tension in the car is thick. Like suffocatingly so.
When I listened to Collin's message, I wanted nothing more than for a
Hellmouth to open up beneath me and swallow me whole. There would be
no badass Slayer coming in and saving the day either.
I'd deserve all the pain and the punishment.
Because I told him his ass was nice.
I fucking told him his ass was nice!
And what did he say to me?
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter because all I could think to say was
something stupid, and every word he uttered in that deep, seductive voice of
his was the opposite of that.
It was perfect.
It made my heart race. Made my fingertips tingle.
It made me feel alive.
And I screwed it all up.
“Col—”
“I think we should stop seeing each other.”
Those eight words feel like a thousand tiny razorblades slicing into my
skin all at once.
But…I think he's right. I think we should stop seeing each other too.
Because clearly we're not on the same page.
I think he has a nice ass, and him? He…
I can't say it. I can't even think it.
It hurts too much.
“Okay.”
“Okay,” he echoes, pulling into my apartment complex.
He pushes the gearshift into park and shuts off the car. He opens his
door and rounds the front of the vehicle to mine.
Of course he's going to walk me.
Of course he's going to be a damn gentleman.
He pops open my door and holds his hand out for me.
Reflexively, I slide my palm against his, letting him help me out. I don't
bother acknowledging the tingles making their way through my body.
He clicks the key fob to lock his car, then rests his hand on my lower
back, guiding me into the building.
We don't speak as we step into the old, cramped elevator.
When we get to my door and I push the key into the hole, we're quiet.
Even when Collin follows me inside and down the hallway to my
bedroom, it's silence.
When he peels my dress from my body and buries himself inside of
me…nothing.
This is our goodbye.
He knows it and so do I.
We don't try to ruin it with words.
In the morning when I wake up to a cold, empty bed, that's when tears
come.
I held him at arm's length. Refused to let him in for fear of getting my
heart broken.
I was a fool to think he wouldn't break it anyway.
21
COLLIN
“I fucking swear, Colter, if you get in my lane one more time, I'm flattening
your ass.”
“Oh, fuck off, Wright.” He skates right up to my face. “You've been
screwing up all morning. This isn't me.” He shoves at me. “It's you.”
I shove him back. “Bullshit it is. You can't keep your shit straight,
shooting pucks all over the ice like some rookie.”
“Hey!” Miller protests.
We ignore him.
“Some of us are over here trying to fix shit.”
“I bet it's your fault,” Colter sneers, “this losing streak we're on. You
fucked it up, didn't you?” He presses his nose to mine. “What happened?
Your little piece of tail run off on you? No more good luck charm for you.
You didn't fuck her good enough, did you?” He laughs. “You should have
sent her my way. I'd have taken care of her.”
For the second time this season, I attack my own teammate.
Only this time, he doesn't get a lick in at all.
I rain blow after blow down on him, hitting him for all the times he's
pissed me off in the past. My knuckles are starting to hurt, and I don't even
care. The bite feels good because anything is better than the way I'm feeling
right now.
An arm wraps around my waist and hauls me off of my downed
teammate. He's bloody and swollen and I don't even give a shit.
“Don't fucking talk about her! Don't go near her!” I yell as Lowell
drags me off the ice. “You fucking hear me, Colter?”
“That's enough,” Lowell says lowly into my ear. “You're done.”
He doesn't let me go until we're off the ice and down the tunnel.
“Fucking shit,” he says to my back as he follows me into the dressing
room.
I crash onto the bench, putting my head in my hands, trying to hide how
much they're shaking.
“What the hell was that, Col? You were relentless.”
“Yeah, well, the dude has been on my ass all season.” I sit back, sucking
in a breath, trying to calm my racing heart rate. “I'm tired of it.”
“No. You instigated it this time. There's more to it than that.” Lowell
stands over me with his hands on his hips. “What's going on, dude?”
What's going on?
What's going on is that I'm fucking miserable.
I haven't seen or talked to Harper in a week. I can barely sleep, my
stomach is all tied up in knots, and any time I do anything to try to get my
mind off shit, it's pointless because it always somehow comes back to her.
I feel like I'm back where I was at the beginning of the season, the
weight of everything crushing me, pulling the air from my lungs and
suffocating me.
The worst part is that it's my own stupid fault again.
But I don't tell him all that.
In fact, I don't say anything at all.
He takes a seat next to me, sighing. “Is what Colter said true? Did you
and Harper break up?”
“We were never together.”
He lifts a brow. “Certainly seemed that way to me.”
Yeah, me too.
“Nope.”
He just nods. “All right. I'll let you sell that story if you want.” He
scrubs a hand over his face. “Fuck, man. You really laid into him.”
“He had it coming.”
Lowell's lips twitch. “Maybe.”
The dressing room door slams open and I inwardly groan as Coach
comes barreling in.
“You.” He points at me, his finger shaking, probably from anger. It's
radiating off him like he's fucking Godzilla all charged up and ready to
blast. “You're benched.”
“What?!”
“Boy!” He stalks across the floor, getting right into my face. “That
circus out there was bullshit, and I will not tolerate it from anyone. I don't
give a shit how many points you're putting up. I don't care how much you
don't like your teammates. I don't give a rat's ass about what's going on in
your personal life. When you're on my ice, you check your shit at the door.
I gave you a pass the first time but I will not let you disrespect my game
again. Do I make myself clear, son?”
I grind my teeth and give him a curt nod because deep down, I know
he's right.
“Clear, Coach.”
“Good. Now get the hell out of my sight.” He looks at Lowell. “Get
back out there.”
Then he's gone, the door slamming shut behind him just like it did when
he walked in.
“Fuck!” I shout, ripping my sweater over my head, throwing it across
the room. “Son of a bitch!”
Lowell shakes his head, a disappointed frown marring his face. “I'll
make sure Colter doesn't get off easy either.”
“No,” I tell him as I begin stripping my gear off. “You said it yourself, I
instigated it.”
He snorts, pushing off the bench. “Yeah, but the shit he said didn't make
matters better.”
He heads for the door, then hesitates.
“Hey, man, listen. If you need anyone to talk to…”
“You're there. Yeah, I know.”
“Oh, you think I want to talk to you? No way. I was gonna put that shit
on Rhodes. He's such a good listener and all.”
For the first time in what feels like days, a smile tugs at my lips.
“And for what it's worth, I'm sorry it didn't work out with Harper. I
really liked her.”
Me too.
Instead, I swallow the lump in my throat and say, “Thanks, Lowell.”
“Of course.”
He disappears back down the tunnel, and I'm left in the dressing room
feeling as defeated and broken as I did just six months ago.
The only thing worse than being on the ice losing is watching your team
lose from the sidelines knowing you could be down there helping them.
“Fuck. This blows so much.”
“Feel like an ass for letting your team down yet?”
I glare at Shep, who is sitting in the private team box beside me.
When I told him I wouldn't be playing tonight, he insisted on coming to
keep me company. I think he just wanted to make sure I wasn't going to
jump from the box or something.
“I really hate you sometimes,” I tell him.
He just laughs, not giving a shit at all.
The second period winds down, and I cringe when I look at the
scoreboard. It's 3-0, and with the way they're playing, I can't see how it's
going to get any better.
As Lowell promised, Colter's out tonight too. I think it might have more
to do with how swollen his eyes are, but still.
“So,” Shep says, “you ever going to tell me what happened?”
“I told you. Got into it with Colter. Coach wasn't happy. The end.”
“Right. Sure. And the reason you got into it with him was…”
I shrug. “You've met the guy. You tell me.”
Shep laughs. “Fair enough.”
He folds his hand over his stomach, stretching his legs out in front of
him. He purses his lips, looking around the swanky box, whistling a soft
tune that's getting on my nerves more and more by the second.
I ignore it.
He gets louder.
“Fuck, man.” I throw my hands in the air. “Enough, okay? I'll tell you.”
He grins victoriously and waits for me to spill all the sordid details.
“There's not much to tell. I was seeing a girl and—”
“The one who had you all smiley and shit?”
“Yeah.” I clear my throat, trying to keep all emotion out of my voice. “It
didn't work out. We…uh…wanted different things.”
I scratch at the beard I've been growing out the last week. And by
growing it out, I mean I've been too fucking lazy to shave. What's the
point? It's not like I'll be burying my face between thighs anytime soon.
“And?” Shep presses when I don't say anything else.
“And what?”
“That's it? That's the reason you're sitting up here tonight? Because
some chick you were banging decided to move on?”
My eyes narrow at his choice of words, and slowly, Shep's brows rise
higher and higher.
“Oh.” He nods once. “You're in love with her.”
I shift in my seat at his statement.
He sits up. “You're like really in love with her. And she doesn't love
you back.”
I toss my head back. “Yes, because that's just what I needed to hear
right now.”
“What happened?”
“What do you mean?”
“I mean, what happened? Why is she not reciprocating your feelings? Is
it because your dick is small?”
“Fuck you,” I mutter, and he chuckles. “No. It's actually because I'm
too perfect.”
His face screws up. “Say what?”
I explain to him what happened at the art show and everything she said
on the recording she doesn't know I heard.
When I'm finished, he doesn't say anything for a long time.
Then finally, he says, “This might not be what you want to hear, but I
get where she's coming from.”
“You do?”
“Yeah. I mean, she spent her whole life thinking her parents had this
perfect marriage, and that was shattered in a big way. She's scared.
Sometimes fear makes you do some really stupid shit.”
“Why does it sound like you're talking from experience?”
He laughs somberly. “Because I am. Because I've been Harper before.
I've pushed the people I love away because of fear, and I regret those years
I missed every single day.” He pats me on the back. “She'll come around.”
“And if she doesn't?”
“Then you can either stay angry at the world and let it ruin everything
you've worked hard for, or you can channel it into something big that
weighs, oh, say, around thirty-five pounds.” He lifts a brow. “You know
what I'm saying?”
“I hear you.”
Focus on the season. Don't let this get in my way.
“Good. But, Collin?”
I glance over at him and he's looking down at the ice, watching the
Zamboni driver clean up.
“Real love doesn't come around often. Hell, sometimes it never comes
around at all. But when it does…it's worth waiting for. Trust me.”
For Harper?
I'd wait forever.

HARPER
“All right. I'm giving you until the count of ten to put away all of your
creepy things, because I'm coming in.”
I wish I were surprised that Ryan's standing at my studio door
threatening to barge her way in, but since I haven't seen her in over a week
now, I knew this day was coming.
“One!”
Crap. I really should take my spare key back.
“Two!”
I don't scramble to clean anything up, because for the first time in a
long time, I have no desire to work on anything.
My work—my passion—is bringing me zero joy right now.
Nothing is, actually. Not my tried-and-true horror movies or my coffee
bar or even a soak in the tub. Nothing feels good anymore, and I can
pinpoint the exact moment when it began.
“Three!”
I rise from my stool and pull the door open.
“Ten,” I say flatly.
“No, four. Did Count von Count teach you nothing?” she says, breezing
into my studio.
I drop back onto my stool and pick up my paintbrush.
Not that I'm painting anything right now. I've been staring at this blank
canvas since I got up this morning. And by got up, I mean since I peeled
myself out of bed after a fitful three hours of slumber.
“Wow,” Ryan says, coming to stand behind me. “It's beautiful. Really
captures the emotion.”
I don't know why, but something in her words triggers the floodgates,
and tears begin to well up in my eyes.
“Oh, shit.” She gathers me in her arms, hugging me closely. “I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to make you cry.”
She didn't mean to, but she lets me do it anyway.
I don't know how long we stand there with me sobbing into her
shoulder, but it's long enough that eventually, the tears aren't coming
anymore. All I'm doing is shaking.
Ryan directs me to the stool, then disappears for less than thirty
seconds. When she comes back, she drapes a blanket over my shoulders and
pulls it tight around me.
The minute I recognize it's the blanket I bought from the gas station
during my mini road trip with Collin, I'm crying all over again.
When I finally get the tears to stop for a second time, I swipe angrily at
my face.
“I don't even know why I'm crying. I'm the one who pushed him away.
I'm the one who wanted this.”
“That doesn't mean it's not going to hurt. Especially since you're in
love with him.”
I glower at her. “I am not.”
She doesn't even try to hide her exasperation with me. “Yes, you are.”
“I'm not, Ryan. I don't do love.”
“You are, and I can prove it to you.”
She disappears again, and this time I follow her. I curl onto the couch as
she rummages through her bag, pulling out her laptop.
She clicks a bunch of buttons, and then a still-frame shot of me fills the
screen.
It's from the art show.
“I just want you to know that the absolute only reason I listened to this
is because you're my best friend and I needed to know how much I should
brush up on my karate so I could kick Collin's ass for hurting you.” A
perfectly shaped brow quirks up. “But it turns out, it's your ass that needs
kicked.”
She hits play, and for several long seconds nothing happens.
Then there's a slight rustling, and I know it's Collin moving around with
the recorder in his hand. He clears his throat.
“So.”
It's one word—one silly, simple word—and already tears are
threatening to spill over again.
“I guess we're supposed to send a message to the person on the other
end of this thing, huh? Ryan said it could be silly or serious or something in
between. I bet you're hoping I say the word cunt, aren't you?”
He chuckles, and the sound slides over me like a warm coat on a cold
winter day.
“But I'm not going to. Well, shit. I guess I technically did, huh?”
Another low laugh.
“I have a confession to make. Last week when I got back from the game
in Colorado, all I wanted to do was go home and sleep. So the second our
plane landed, I was out and in my car with no time to spare. I got behind the
wheel and I drove home. Only I didn't drive to my apartment. I drove to
yours.”
Just like it did the first time I heard it, his confession squeezes at my
heart.
“At first I didn't understand it, so I just sat there in my car in your
parking lot for a long time. Like way-past-the-level-of-appropriate kind of
long. I kept trying to figure out why. Why? Why, when I was dead on my
feet, when all I wanted was to go home, did I drive to you?” He sighs. “And
then it hit me. It's because whenever I think of home now, I think of you. I
think of you in bed, waiting for me to come crawling into the sheets after a
game. I think of you lazing around in those ridiculous pajamas with the
sexy Michael Myers on them. I mean, come on, what the hell even are
those?”
“Rude,” I mutter.
“That's not all I think about either, but I'm not going to say the rest on
tape because I'm not so sure I trust Ryan won't ever listen to this.”
“Smart man,” the woman in question says.
“I think…I think what I'm trying to say is that maybe Lowell and
Rhodes were right. Maybe the dick does protest too much and maybe there
was a disturbance in the Force. And maybe…maybe I'm in love with you.”
He laughs dryly. “Oh, hell. Who am I kidding? There's no maybe. I am. I
know it's not what we said we're doing and I understand if you're not here
yet, but I couldn't come into this box knowing your reaction was going to
be caught on camera and not tell you.
“So, Ryan, if you're listening…get ready to take the shot.” A brief
pause. “I love you, Harper. And I'll wait for you as long as you need.”
The volume cuts out and the screen fades to black.
“Did you see it?” Ryan asks.
“See what?”
“Your face—did you see it?”
I shake my head. I wasn't paying attention.
Ryan hits rewind, then presses play.
“I love you, Harper,” Collin says again.
“Did you see? Watch your eyes. Watch what happens when he says it.”
She goes back again, hits play.
This time, I do what she says.
And this time, I see it.
“The way your eyes completely change…the light that blinks into them
and slowly transforms your face…that's what the project is about, capturing
that raw emotion.” She points at the screen. “That proves to me that you're
in love with him too.”
I'd be an idiot to try to sit here and lie to her, to tell her I'm not in love
with Collin. But…
“I don't know if I can do it,” I tell her.
“Why not? Because of your dad?”
“Yes. You know that.”
“I do know that. Just like I know it's a bullshit reason.”
“He cheated on my mother! He died—died—because he was cheating
on her! She gave everything to him and he left her broken and he left me.
He left me broken.”
“I know he hurt you. I understand that. But you can't hide from
everything just because you're afraid of getting hurt again.”
“I can too.”
“Fine. You can. But you're going to live a shitty life and you're going to
miss out on a lot. Don't you find it ironic that you love horror movies but
you're too scared to fall in love?”
“Horror movies are predictable. Love isn't.”
“That's half the fun in it! Taking risks, putting yourself out there. That's
the whole point.”
“But if it fails?”
“Then it fails. And it hurts and it sucks. But you dust yourself off and
you move on. Honestly, if someone told me falling in love was going to be
a breeze and there would never be any kind of trouble or problems, I
probably wouldn't want to fall in love.”
“You wouldn't?”
“No. I mean, come on. Even romantic comedies have some sort of
drama to them. It'd be boring if they just fell in love and that was it. There
would be no…pizzazz, you know?”
I guess I can see where she's coming from, but…
“I'm scared.”
“I know you are. But he's not like your dad.”
“I know that.”
“Do you?”
“Yes! But it doesn't make me any less scared to love him. What if I lose
him too?”
“Haven't you already though? Wouldn't you rather love him fiercely
while you can than not at all?”
I don't have to think about the answer to that question because it's a
resounding yes.
I'd rather have some time with him than none at all, and I thought that
was what I was doing by keeping it casual. We were together, but there was
no risk involved.
I was a fool to think there was no way I'd fall for him.
How could I not?
“What am I supposed to do now?”
“Oh.” She taps her fingers together excitedly. “I am so glad you asked. I
have an idea…”

CAROLINA VS NASHVILLE
“Well, J.P., I am telling you, there's just something different in the air
tonight. Maybe it's having Collin Wright back out on the ice after being a
healthy scratch last game, or maybe it's something else entirely. Either way,
I've got a feeling this is going to be a good one.”
“No doubt about it, Hank,” J.P. agrees. “We have a packed house
tonight too. The fans are excited and buzzing. I see a bunch of signs out
there this evening.”
“So many signs. There's even one with a special message for our
returning defenseman it looks like. What's that say, J.P.?”
“Hey, #96! You could say I'm a fan.”
“Well, simple and to the point. We're all fans of #96. Here's hoping he
can get back on that point streak tonight.”
24
CAROLINA AT TORONTO
“Say, did you catch the Carolina game the other night, Mikey?”
“I did. And if you're getting at what I think you are, that girl held that
sign up all night long, Jonesy.”
“Interviewers asked Collin Wright after the game what he thought and
he opted to not answer, which led many to speculate about whether he knew
the woman or not.”
“Hmm, interesting. Oh, wait, hang on here. I think we have another
Sign Girl tonight. No, wait. There are two! Hey, Jobe, can you get that
camera over in Section 217?”
“Well, I'll be. We do! We have one tonight, Mikey! Looks like Collin
Wright might have his very own fan club following him around.”
“What's it say tonight, Jonesy?”
“Hey, #96! You know what they say about tall hockey players, right?
And the other one reads, Big sticks!”
“Oh, thank god. Thought we were about to be in trouble on network
television for a moment there, Jonesy.”
25
CAROLINA AT CHICAGO
“We are back tonight with another Carolina Comets game, and I gotta say,
this #SignGirlGate has taken the internet by storm, Mikey.”
“I'm kind of hoping we have one here tonight. I'm invested.”
“When Collin was asked about the latest sign last night, he laughed but
didn't provide any more insight.”
“I get the feeling he knows more than he's letting on, Jonesy. Maybe it's
all to drum up publicity for something?”
“I don't know, Mikey. Collin Wright is a notoriously private man. I
can't imagine he'd be participating in this for attention.”
“Well, looks like our wishes are being granted! I just got word there is
yet another Sign Girl in the building tonight. Camera, can we get an eye on
her?”
“Ah! There she is! What's it say tonight?”
“Hey, #96! And then there's just a picture of a corn dog.”
“A corn dog? Why a corn dog?”
“I do not know, but I'm sure the internet is going to be buzzing trying to
figure out who this girl is.”
26
CAROLINA AT ARIZONA
“We asked Collin Wright last night what he thought about the corn dog, and
he said he took it as a compliment.”
“Did he elaborate on what it means?”
“No, but it seems like a good thing. Most of Twitter is claiming it
alludes to something sexual. Speaking of…the sign tonight might be a little
racy for television, Mikey.”
“I'm not even sure we can show it. Oh, we can?”
“Oh, man. I'm blushing just reading it.”
“What's it say, Jonesy?”
“Hey, #96! Want to have Creme Pies and Ding Dongs together? They
taped a Little Debbie Oatmeal Creme Pie and a Hostess Ding Dong onto the
sign.”
“Looks like our Sign Girl is growing bolder.”
“And bigger. She was trending on Twitter last night and this morning. If
only we could get Collin Wright's insight into all of this. He's been
tightlipped on the whole thing.”
“At what point do we question if it's affecting his playing, Jonesy?”
“Affecting his playing? I think it's helping! He's put up a point per
game, and the Comets are on a hot streak right now. Whoever this Sign Girl
is, if she's a fan of the Comets, she better keep them coming!”
27
HARPER
“No way, you're totally Sign Girl, aren't you?” I turn to find the woman
from the first game I attended sitting a few seats down again. “Like the
original one, yeah?”
I hold my finger to my lips, and she laughs.
“Oh, man. We've been following you since the beginning. I have no
idea how you're getting these signs all over these last two weeks, but it's
been entertaining, that's for sure.”
“Well, I'm glad. Delia, right?”
“Yes, you remembered!”
“Kind of easy for me. I'm a big Beetlejuice fan.”
“That's fair.” She turns toward me, leaning across the seat next to her.
“So what's the story—you two dating or something?”
“Or something,” I answer.
“Playing your cards close. I can respect that.”
“It's a little complicated. I sort of screwed things up, and I'm trying to
make up for it.”
“Oh, trust me—I totally understand that. I almost lost the best thing that
happened to me too. But after a very well-thought-out goat heist, it all
worked out in the end.” She waves her hand like she didn't just drop a
really juicy tidbit. “Anyway, what's the sign say tonight? Is this the one
where you win him back?”
“I hope so.”
“I hope so too. My brother-in-law is actually Collin's agent. He's a
really great guy. We're big fans of his.”
“Is he really?”
“Yep. Shep's a total shithead, but he's really great at what he does. Not
that I'd ever tell him that.”
“You know that girl I was here with last time?”
“Gorgeous blonde?”
“Yeah. She sold some photographs to Shep's wife.”
“No.” Delia's eyes widen. “You have no idea how obsessed I am with
her work. I keep trying to steal Denver's pictures. What a small world!”
“It really is.”
“All right. I have nachos, popcorn, a large fry—extra ranch, of course—
and a large Coke to split,” Delia's husband says, plopping down into the
seat next to her.
“Oh thank god. Sustenance.” She reaches for the food, shoving a
handful of fries into her mouth all at once.
“Hey! I got those for my ranch.”
I think he means he got ranch for his fries, but I'm not going to question
it.
Delia holds out a bucket of popcorn to me. “Want some?”
“No, but thank you.”
“If you change your mind, just let us know. Zach tends to go overboard
on the snacks.”
“Because you tend to hog them all,” he grumbles.
I'm too nervous to eat right now. Hell, I've barely been able to stomach
anything for the last few weeks. Ryan played my message to Collin back to
me, and I'd had no idea he heard everything I said. It makes me sick that he
might think he's not worth it for me.
The team is about to take the ice for warmups any minute now, and
from where I'm sitting, there's a clear view to the bench across the way.
There's no way Collin will be able to miss me.
“Hey, what'd I miss?” Ryan drops into the seat next to me.
“Just me trying to hold my vomit down.”
“Stop it. It'll be fine. He's going to love it.”
“Are we sure? I've seen all of his post-game interviews. Every time
they ask him about the signs, he changes the subject.”
“No. Every time they ask him, his lips twitch and then he changes the
subject. He likes it. Trust me.”
The few people in their seats already start buzzing around us, and I pull
my attention to the ice.
A player from the Comets smacks a bunch of pucks off the wall and
then the skates hit the ice.
I know the minute Collin steps out.
Ugh. Even from the other side of the ice, he looks incredible.
It's been nearly three weeks since I've seen him. That's three weeks of
pure agony. Three weeks of having to live with the fact that I'm a moron for
ever letting myself think he wasn't worth it.
Because he is.
He's worth it all and more.
He stops in the middle of the ice, his head bent low, talking to Rhodes
about something.
“Go!” Ryan hisses beside me. “Do it!”
On unsteady legs, I rise from my seat and head for the stairs.
I walk down the few steps until I've reached the glass. Then, with a
steadying breath, I push my sign up against it.
I have no idea how long I hold it there. Seconds, maybe minutes. I don't
keep track because all I can focus on is remembering to breathe.
There's a tap on the glass, and I stumble backward, dropping the sign.
Collin.
He's staring down at me with those green eyes I love so much.
He's not smiling…but he's not frowning either. He's just watching.
Unsure of what to do, I lift my hand and wave.
“Harper!” Ryan hisses from somewhere behind me.
And just like in his interview, Collin's lips twitch.
“I love you!” I shout, unable to hold it in any longer.
His eyes widen and he takes a surprised step back.
At least I hope it's a surprised step.
I hope that in the last few weeks, he hasn't changed his mind.
Someone calls his name, and he looks torn between wanting to stay and
needing to go.
“Go,” I tell him. “I'll wait for you as long as you need.”
“Oh, god. My arms are getting so tired.”
“Then drop the sign. Collin's already seen it.”
“No! It's my thing—my brand. You should know that, Miss Social
Media Guru.”
“Ugh. Whatever. Some days I really just want to erase my Instagram.
I—”
A collective gasp moves through the arena and people shoot to their
feet, trying to see what's going on.
There's a player down, and without even seeing who it is, I know it's
Collin.
“What happened?” I ask the person on the other side of me.
They shrug. “I don't know. I missed it. Looks hurt though.”
I want to yell Yeah, no shit he's hurt, but I refrain.
I watch as team medics run onto the ice to check on him. He's still
down, and I really don't like that he's still down.
Finally, after what feels like hours, with just over half of the third period
left to play, Collin is helped off the ice. He gives the crowd a thumbs-up as
he's assisted down the tunnel.
I suck in a large gulp of air, realizing I was holding my breath.
“Hey, it's okay,” Ryan reassures me, pulling me back down into my
seat. “I'm sure he's fine. It's probably just precautionary. He walked off on
his own and gave a thumbs-up. That's a really good sign.”
I exhale sharply, then suck in another breath of air, trying to calm
myself. My stomach is rolling and I think I may barf. I'd give anything
right now to know he's okay.
The game resumes, and the minutes tick by so damn slowly.
“Excuse me? Miss Kelly?” There's a man with a very official-looking
badge hanging around his neck leaning over me. “Could you come with me,
please?”
I look at Ryan, and she just shrugs.
“I'll be right back,” I tell her, handing her my sign. “What's this about?”
I ask the gentleman as I follow him up the stairs.
“Mr. Wright wanted to see you. We don't usually do this, but since
we're all such big Sign Girl fans…”
He doesn't say anything else as he leads me through a series of tunnels
and doors until finally he pushes one open and there sits a battered-looking
Collin.
He gives me a small grin when he sees me, and my feet carry me across
the room on instinct.
I don't stop until I'm standing at his knees.
There's a large gash above his left brow, and it's obvious he's favoring
the right side of his body.
“I look worse than I feel, I promise.”
They're the first words he's said to me in weeks, and suddenly they're
my favorite words in the world.
“What happened?”
He shrugs, then winces at the movement. “Took a funny hit and my
helmet came loose. My head bounced off the ice when I went down.”
“Are you going to be okay?”
“Yeah. I'm done for the night, but I'm okay. Nothing serious. Just sore.”
“See, I told you all the ramming was an awful idea.”
“I didn't hear you complaining.”
I blush at his words.
A silence falls between us. I have so many words I want to fill it with,
but I don't know where to start.
“Harper, I—”
“No,” I interrupt. “I want to go first, okay?”
“Okay. But can you at least come here?”
He reaches out for me, and I step between his legs. He drops his
forehead to mine, one hand on my waist, the other cradling my face.
He sighs the moment we make contact, and I feel the exact same way.
“You wanted to go first?” he asks.
I nod, then swallow. “I…I'm sorry. I messed up. I…I pushed you away.
I got scared and I freaked. I didn't know how to handle the fact that
whatever we had wasn't casual. Hell, I don't think it's ever been casual,
really. I didn't know what to do with the fact that you loved me, didn't
know how to accept that, how to allow it…” I lick my suddenly dry lips.
“I…I lost my father when I was sixteen. We didn't find out until after he
passed that he was unfaithful to my mother for years. We had no clue, and it
hurt us deeply. It hurt me deeply. He was my best friend. We did everything
together. He was the one who turned me on to horror. He was the one who
encouraged me to pursue art. He was the one who believed in me. And he
lied. Over and over again. Straight to my face. It hurt so much to know that.
I've been torn between loving him and being angry at him for the last eight
years.”
I sigh, pulling back, looking up into his eyes. “But I'm tired of being
mad. I'm tired of being scared. I'm tired of always waiting for the other
shoe to drop because I can't trust anyone. I want to be happy. Bold. Brave.
And I want to fall in love and live in the moment of it, not worry about how
or when it'll fail. Being without you these last few weeks… It hurt so bad
and I don't want to feel like that again.”
I reach out, brushing a tentative finger over his fresh cut.
“I love you, Collin, and I think—” I shake my head. “No, I know you're
worth it. Worth taking that risk for…if you'll let me.”
He doesn't say anything for a long moment, and I worry that maybe I'm
too late.
But then he finally speaks.
“You know, I think a part of me started falling for you the first time we
met.”
“Really? Was it my driving skills?”
He chuckles, then winces. “Yes. It was definitely that. And also the fact
that you were just so…cute.” I glare at him. “You were funny and different
and I just really liked being around you.” He shakes his head. “I should
have known. Should have known it when you calmed the storm inside me
then.”
“You're welcome.”
He grins, pulling me closer. “Can I say something without you freaking
out on me?”
“Yes.”
“I love you.”
I sigh. “Say it again.”
“I love you.” He brushes his lips against mine. “I didn't mean to fall.
You were just supposed to be a distraction, something to keep my mind off
the game. And it worked, maybe a little too well. I just…I love you. So
much.”
“I love you too.”
He kisses me slowly and softly and for so long I'm sure the game is
long over by now.
When we finally pull apart, there's a permanent smile etched on my
face.
“One more question,” he says.
“What's that?”
“The signs all over the country…how'd you do it?”
“It was Ryan's idea. She used her social media following to find hockey
fans, and it just worked.”
“It really did. I think tonight's sign was my favorite though.”
“Yeah?”
“Definitely.” He nods. “Because I love you too.”
EPILOGUE
COLLIN
I glance up at the jumbotron as I fly down the ice, the puck at the end of my
stick.
We're tied in Game Seven with a minute and a half to go.
Just one goal. That's all we need.
We can do it. I know we can. I feel it in the air. In my bones. It's
palpable. So damn close I can almost fucking taste it.
I pass to Rhodes and he plays with it a bit, watching the other skaters
before zipping it back my way.
Twenty.
I line up my shot, watching the Vegas guys in my periphery.
Fifteen.
I wait for the screen.
Ten seconds.
I pull my arm back.
Eight.
And swing.
The puck hits the back of the net, and the buzzer sounds with just
seconds to spare.
We won.
We fucking won.
Gloves and sticks and helmets fly into the air as body after body slams
into the glass with me trapped in the middle.
I've never been so thrilled to have the wind knocked out of me before.
“Holy shit!” Rhodes yells, grabbing me in a hug when he finally pushes
through the crowd. I've never seen him smile so damn big before. “We
fucking did it! We did it!”
He gives me a shake, then skates off, hugging everyone he can get his
hands on.
“Come here, you beautiful bastard!” Miller grabs me next, kissing the
side of my head. “Fucking killed it!”
And finally, when my captain skates up to me, I'm choking back the
tears. I stick my hand out to shake his, and he shoves it away and hauls me
into him. He hugs me tight, patting me on the back.
“Proud of you,” he says into my ear.
“You too.”
Everyone skates around, hugging one another about four or five times
each. The air is pure electricity at this point.
We gather together for photos, and the Cup is presented.
It's all so surreal, and I'll remember the moment for the rest of my life.
My parents each give me a hug, then my brother and his boyfriend.
When we're all hugged out, that's when I hear it.
“Hey, Hockey Guy!”
I spin toward my favorite sound in the world.
Harper's standing a few feet away, one of those silly signs she's so
popular for hanging between her fingertips, a smile plastered across her
face.
I don't waste a moment, skating toward her and scooping her into my
arms.
I slant my mouth over hers, kissing her until we're both breathless.
“Hi,” I whisper against her lips, setting her back down on the ice.
“Hi,” she says on a smile, then gives me another peck. “I'm so proud of
you.”
“I couldn't have done it without you.”
“I doubt that.”
“It's true. You're my good luck charm.”
“You don't really believe in all that mumbo jumbo.”
I didn't, not really. Not before her.
“So, what's your sign say tonight?”
She pulls it out from behind her back and holds it up for me to read.
Hey, #96! I asked Lord Stanley if he wants to have a threesome tonight.
He said yes.
“Hmm. Very fitting.”
“How so?”
“Just something I've been thinking about lately is all.”
Her eyes light up in surprise. “Oh, really?”
“Yep. Does that scare you?”
“Yes. Horribly so.”
“My little Horror Harper. She'll fight off a killer or slay a demon, but
when it comes to the man who loves her asking for her hand in marriage,
she'll say—”
“Yes.” Harper grabs my sweater, pulling me down to her. “She'll say
yes.”
“Really?”
She nods with a grin. “Really.”
“Hmm. I'll have to keep that in mind.” I kiss her again. “What if we had
lost?”
“You wouldn't have.”
“But you had a sign made anyway, didn't you?”
She nods, then pulls away and shows me other side of the sign.
A laugh bursts out of me as I read it.
Oops?
Shaking my head, I pull her back to me. “I love you, Harper.”
She sighs against me. “And I love you, Hockey Guy.”
Turns out getting the game-winning goal in Game Seven of the Stanley Cup
Finals is a pretty damn good reason for your team to re-sign you for six
more years.
I'm staying in North Carolina.
And that's why we're here in Vegas to celebrate. Well, that and the Cup.
“To Hot Hockey Guy!” an inebriated Ryan yells. “And Hot Hitchhiker!”
She holds up what I think is her sixth shot…of the hour. That doesn't
include the frozen drink she sucked down and the three shots she did before
we even left the hotel. “He got the Cup, he got the girl, and he got the
contract, baby!”
She downs the shot, not bothering to wait for anyone else.
I pull Harper into me, dropping my lips to her ear. “Your friend is
completely hammered.”
“Oh, I know.”
“Think we should call it a night?”
“For all of us?”
She looks up at me with hope in her eyes, and I laugh. “Not so fast. I
still have plans to dance with you tonight. I meant for the drunk one.”
“Oh. Then my answer is still yes.” She glances over at Rhodes, who
looks like he's having the worst time ever. “I have no idea where Miller and
Lowell ran off to, but think Rhodes can take her back to her room?”
Do I think so? Yeah. I trust Rhodes with my life. He'd never let
anything happen to Ryan.
I kick his foot with mine. He directs his furrowed brows my way, and I
slide my eyes up to Ryan.
Being Rhodes, he understands what I'm asking.
Take care of her.
He rises from the plush lounge chair and reaches up, grabbing Ryan
down from the top of the booth where she's currently yelling and dancing.
“No, thank you!” she says to him, booping him on the nose.
His scowl deepens, and I can't help but laugh.
Annoyed, he slings her over his shoulder.
“Hey! You cranky hot giant! Put me down!”
He ignores her.
“Harper! Help!”
Harper just shakes her head. “No! Go lie down—you're drunk!”
Ryan gasps. “I am not!”
“Are too!”
“You traitor!” she yells to her friend, banging on Rhodes' back. “I
thought you loved me!”
“I do!” Harper tells her. “It's for your own good.”
“He's going to kidnap me and hold me hostage in his castle!”
I swear I hear Rhodes mutter, “You wish.”
Ryan swats at him again, then shakes her tiny fist at us, and we laugh.
When they're out of eyesight, I grab Harper's drink from her hand, then
stand. She looks up at me with confusion.
“Dance with me.”
“No way.”
“Harper Dolores Kelly…dance with me, dammit.”
She laughs at the use of her full name and pushes to her feet. I let my
eyes trail over her body in a very appreciative manner. She's wearing a
black dress that's full of sparkles, and it's hugging every damn curve she
has. I already can't wait to see how it looks on our hotel room floor.
I pull her through the club and onto the dance floor. I don't go too far
into the crowd, wanting to make sure she has a clear exit in case she wants
to leave, but just enough that it feels like we're in a sea of bodies.
I tug her close to me, pressing my body against hers. I place a hand on
the small of her back and bring the other up to my chest.
“Are you slow dancing with me in the middle of a club?” She grins up
at me.
“Yes.”
“Why?”
“I'm practicing,” I tell her.
“For what?”
I pull her closer, dropping my lips to her ear. “Our wedding.”
When I pull back, her jaw is dropped, and she's watching me with a
surprised grin.
“What?” I ask, spinning us, not caring at all that we look like fools right
now. “I'm being serious.”
“I know you are.” She shakes her head. “You're awfully full of yourself,
Hockey Guy.”
“Nah. I'm just sure I'm going to love you forever.”
Her breath hitches and I watch her closely, waiting for her to freak out
or say something.
She doesn't do either.
Instead, she presses her mouth to mine and tells me she feels the same
with her kiss.

RYAN
“To Hot Hockey Guy! And Hot Hitchhiker! He got the Cup, he got the girl,
and he got the contract, baby!”
I toss back the shot of tequila like I'm a pro.
At this point, I just might be.
I've had quite a few drinks within the last hour, but it's fine. I'm fine. I
have a good buzz going and I'm feeling amazing. Much better than I have
in a long time.
I'm not thinking about my ex who is expecting a baby with someone
else. And I certainly am not thinking about how the cost of my
grandmother's assisted living facility went up and I have no idea how I'm
going to pay for it now. How the salon I worked at let me go last week
because they had to downsize. How I haven't told my best friend I'm really
only one bad day away from being totally broke and sleeping on her couch.
Nope. Not thinking about any of that.
I'm just having fun in Vegas on a trip I'm not paying for and not
worrying about any of it.
I glance over at my best friend, Harper, and her ridiculously hot NHL
player boyfriend, Collin, and frown.
I'm happy for Harper. Totally one hundred percent happy. Not at all
jealous of the way her boyfriend looks at her. Just because I'm the one who
is the hopeless romantic and believes in soulmates and Harper never has
doesn't mean I should have been the one to find true love first.
Nope. Not jealous.
Their heads are bent close together and they're whispering. I just know
it's about me.
Poor, poor, single-as-a-Pringle Ryan.
All lonely and drunk in Vegas.
So sad.
I'm certain that's what they're saying because I can read their lips and
that's exactly what it looks like.
Somebody tugs on my hand, and I look over.
It's Rhodes.
Ugh, Rhodes. Mr. Grumpbutt.
He's always frowning and never having a good time. Not even now
when we're in Vegas celebrating all kinds of exciting things like how his
best friend won a Stanley freakin' Cup. Okay, fine—I guess he won it too
because they both play for the Carolina Comets, but who cares! We're
celebrating Collin, not Mr. Grumpbutt.
Rhodes tugs my hand again, and I look down at him.
He motions for me to get off the table I'm currently standing on. I shake
my head because he's not the boss of me. If possible, his always frowning
mouth pulls down even farther. He grabs my hand again.
I bend down so I'm at eye level and poke him right in the nose.
“No, thank you!”
Collin laughs, pulling my attention, and says something else to Harper.
Their mouths move again, and I squint, trying to see what they're
saying now, but I can't because I'm upside down.
I'm upside down because I've been captured by a beast who won't let
anyone else have a good time.
“Hey! You cranky hot giant! Put me down!”
He ignores me.
“Harper! Help!” I yell to my best friend.
Harper just shakes her head. “No! Go lie down—you're drunk!”
I gasp. “I am not!”
I'm not drunk, just buzzed. How dare she!
“Are too!”
“You traitor!” And she is. She's the biggest traitor ever. Who lets their
friend get stolen away like this? I swat at the giant carrying me out of the
club and away from my new best friend, alcohol.
“I thought you loved me!” I yell to my old best friend.
“I do!” the traitor yells back. “It's for your own good.”
My own good? Is she nuts?! She's sending me off with a beast!
“He's going to kidnap me and hold me hostage in his castle!”
I swear I hear Rhodes mutter, “You wish.”
I swat at him again for that comment, and he ignores my fighting once
more.
When it's clear there's no use fighting him and Harper is not going to
rescue me, I shake my fist at her and give in to my kidnapper as he carries
me toward the door.
He doesn't stop moving until we're outside on the strip. He pulls me
down his shoulder and sets my feet on the ground.
“Watch it, Mr. Handsy!” I say when his hands slide over my hips.
He rolls his eyes, grabs my hand again, and begins dragging me down
the sidewalk.
I try to tug out of his grasp, but it's no use. He's too strong. Too strong
and too muscly and oh wow…his back looks really hot in that shirt. It's all
tight and maybe a size too small with the way it's stretching across him.
Rhodes keeps towing me along, and I keep letting him. But only
because my feet are tired. Why did I wear stilettos again?
I crash into him when the big lug makes a sudden stop.
“Hey!” I brush my hair out of my face just in time to see him steer us
into an old, fifties-style diner. “What are we—oh! French fries!” I reach for
one and Rhodes smacks my hand away. “Ow!”
“Sorry,” I hear him say.
“You most certainly are not forgiven.”
“I wasn't apologizing to you. I was apologizing to the guy you just tried
to steal food from. Come on.”
More tugging and pulling.
Then pushing as he slides me into a booth. He leaves me sitting and
walks up to the counter. He leans in close, talking to a server. I should make
a run for it. He'd never catch me. There's no way.
But I'm too tired to move.
I slump onto the table, resting my chin in my palm, closing my eyes for
just a moment.
I startle when Rhodes slides his big body into the booth across from me.
He's staring right at me, and I hate it because I like it.
I don't want to like it.
I look around, anywhere but at him.
“Ew. This place is hideous,” I say. It's true. It's so ugly. Pastel blues and
pinks cover the walls, and the décor is dated, and I hate it all. “Why are we
here?”
“You need food.”
Now it's my turn to frown. “I'm not hungry.”
I'm not. I just want to go back to the club and dance and have fun and
forget all about how sad and lonely I am.
Rhodes either didn't hear me, or he doesn't care. I wave my hand in his
face, trying to get his attention.
“Hello, Mr. Grumpbutt, did you hear me? I. Am. Not. Hungry.” I
enunciate every syllable extra clearly just in case.
“You're eating. You need to soak up some of the alcohol before I take
you back to your room.”
I rear my head back. “Um, I am not taking you back to my hotel room.
We aren't having the sex.”
“I didn't suggest having the sex,” he mocks, lips twitching, “but it's nice
to see where your mind goes. I said I'm taking you back to your room. For
sleeping.”
A pretty waitress sets down a plate of French fries and a giant, juicy
burger.
“Eat,” Rhodes instructs. “The last thing I need you to do is choke on
your own puke.”
I wrinkle my nose at his words but do as he says because the food does
look really good.
I bite into a fry and moan. “Oh god. This is soooo good.”
That stupid wrinkle that's always between his eyebrows deepens. “It's a
fry. Stop moaning like you're having an orgasm.”
“How do you know that's my orgasm sound?”
He ignores me and steals a fry from the basket. I let him, but only
because I'm too busy shoving another one in my own mouth.
Before I know it, I've eaten half the basket and gulped a whole glass of
water, which is saying something because I hate water.
I'm starting to feel much better, and the ugly diner isn't spinning nearly
as much.
My phone buzzes in my purse and I pull it out.
It's my ex-best friend.
Harper: Don't be mad at me for sending you off with Rhodes.
Me: I'm mad. So, so mad.
Harper: Liar. Are you okay? Send me a pic so I know you're
alive.
I snap a selfie and send it as proof of life. She sends me one back of her and
Collin, and it makes me sad all over again.
“You okay?” Rhodes asks when he notices I'm frowning.
“No.”
“No? Are you going to puke?” He looks alarmed.
I throw a fry at him. “No. I can hold my liquor just fine, thank you.”
“Then what's wrong?”
I shrug. “I don't know. I'm… Have you ever been in love?”
He's taken aback by my question. “What?”
“Have you ever been in love?”
He scoffs and shrugs. “I guess you can call it that.”
“Aww. You sound sad. Is that why you're grumpy all the time? Because
you're sad because you got your heart broken?”
A scowl. “Sure.”
“But she did break your heart, right?”
“She…dumped me, yes.”
“Dumped you? But you're you. Hotshot NHL superstar. You're…” I
gasp. “Oh no. You're bad in the sack, aren't you?”
His eyes narrow. “Shut up and eat your food, Ryan.”
“I'm full.”
“Too bad. Eat more.”
I pick up a fry and nibble at it just to satisfy him. “What's her name?”
“Who?”
“The girl you couldn't make come.”
“That's not…” He sighs, shaking his head as he settles back into the
booth. “Brittney.”
“Spears?”
I don't know why I said that. Of course it's not her.
“Kline.”
I grab my phone, tap on Instagram, and type in her name. A few profiles
pop up, but I know who it is the minute I see her.
I shove my phone in his face anyway just to be sure. “This is her?”
He glances at the screen for just a second and then away again like it's
painful to look at her. He nods once.
She's gorgeous. Like supermodel gorgeous.
“She's really pretty. How long were you together?”
“A few years off and on. We've been more off recently though. But
we'll be fine. We always are.”
I listen to him as I keep scrolling through her photos. She posts a lot.
Like three times a day.
But it's the post from two nights ago that really captures my attention.
“Is that why you've been so sad this weekend? Because she's engaged
to someone else?”
His head whips my way. “What?”
He looks…sad. And mad.
He looks smad.
“Engaged.”
“No.”
“Yes. See.”
I show him my phone and he snatches it out of my hand, looking at the
image more closely. I might still be buzzed, but the emotions that run over
his face are clear as day.
Anger.
Hurt.
Sadness.
Heartbreak.
“You didn't know?” I ask quietly.
He shakes his head, not taking his eyes off the photo. “No. I… Like I
said…I thought we'd be fine. We're always…fine.” He stares and stares,
almost like he's willing whatever it is he's seeing to be something else.
But it doesn't change. She's engaged to someone else, and he's hurting.
And now I feel bad because he feels bad.
“Rhodes, are you—”
“This is my teammate.”
“What?”
“The guy. In the photo—he's my teammate. Well, he was my teammate.
I…I won a fucking Cup with this dude.”
“Oh.”
I don't know what to say. I don't know how to comfort him. I don't
even know if he needs comforting because I don't really know him.
“Drink.”
“What?”
He shoves my phone back to me. “Drink. I need a drink. A distraction.
Dancing. Fun. Anything.”
His words surprise me. I haven't seen him drink more than one beer
since we've been in Vegas, and he certainly hasn't been dancing. But right
now, he looks like he could use more than one beer and the distraction.
“Please.”
He's looking at me with a desperation I'm not sure I can ignore.
I shouldn't. I know I shouldn't. I've just started to sober up and there is
nothing good that comes from drinking to forget.
But that hopeless, heartbroken look in his eyes reminds me of the same
hopeless, heartbroken look in my eyes.
We're kindred spirits. We need this. We need to let loose and forget our
troubles. Forget the people who make us feel this way.
We deserve it.
“Okay,” I say quietly. “Okay.”
Rhodes rises from the booth and holds his hand out to me.
I slide my palm against his, letting him pull me up.
“Lead the way,” I tell him.
And he does.

RHODES
What's that saying? Go big or go home?
I went too fucking big.
I'm not a big party guy. I don't do loud and crazy. My idea of a wild
night is drinking coffee and starting a Lord of the Rings marathon at 9 PM.
I'm boring and known for being a bit humdrum. I rarely let loose or get
rowdy anywhere other than on the ice. I'm notorious for not being involved
in many extracurriculars, and I don't do anything to draw any extra
attention to myself.
Of course the one time I actually do, I fuck it all up majorly.
Me, my best friend and teammate Collin, and two other guys on the
team I'm closest with—Miller and Lowell—had a weekend planned in
Vegas. It was supposed to be a getaway just for us to celebrate winning the
Stanley Cup. We were going to eat good food, drink a little booze, and bet
way too much money on black.
Then Collin had to go and fall in love and bring his girlfriend along.
Naturally, she brought her best friend along because she was sad.
Something about her being dumped and needing time away.
Collin made me promise I'd be “extra nice.”
I highly doubt this is the kind of extra nice he meant.
I can feel the weight of it pressing down on me.
Or more specifically, I can feel the weight of it pressing down on my
finger.
I peel open one eye and peek down at the gold band that feels like it
weighs a thousand pounds. I press my palms into my eyes like I'm trying to
rub away the memories of last night.
And really, I am trying to rub them away, because what the hell were we
thinking? Why did we believe this was an okay idea? In what universe is
getting married in Vegas a good idea?
It's not. It's an awful idea.
I should have taken Ryan back to her hotel room safe and sound just
like I promised Harper I would.
But no. I had to drink away my sorrows and do something
monumentally stupid.
I hate drunk me.
My head pounds—probably from the dehydration—but I don't dare get
up for water.
Ryan's sleeping right next to me, and I'm not sure I'm ready to deal
with her right now.
My wife.
My stomach turns at the thought.
We can get it annulled; I know that. And if I really want to cause a
scene, I'm sure I can get a lawyer involved because of us being so
intoxicated. There's no way that was legal, no matter how much money (it
was a lot) I threw at them.
I know deep down none of that matters though.
I can hear my phone buzzing on the bedside table, which can only mean
one thing: I did not imagine us videoing the wedding and posting it online.
The nail is already in the proverbial coffin. There's no way I can walk
this back now without looking like a complete fool. I can't just pretend it
didn't happen and forget it.
I wish I could though. I wish I could forget it all.
Except for the part where she kissed me. The way her soft lips felt under
mine. The way she melted into my touch. Those little noises she made as
our tongues collided.
That I do not want to forget.
Or the part where we couldn't keep our hands off each other after that
and spent the Uber ride back to the hotel with our mouths pressed together.
The moment I pushed open the hotel door, she stripped down to her
underwear. Somewhere in my drunken brain, warning bells started to ring,
and I had to put a stop to what we were about to do.
The look in her eyes when I turned her down about killed even drunk
me.
But I'm glad I did it. I don't think I could manage the aftermath of that
on top of everything else.
My phone buzzes again and Ryan groans. I should silence it before she
wakes up.
As slowly as I can, I roll over and grab the phone from the table.
The first thing I catch sight of is a message from my mother.
Mom: ADRIAN TYLER RHODES! THIS HAD BETTER BE A
JOKE!!
Shit. Middle name and double exclamations. That's how I really know I'm
in trouble.
My eyes wander to the text from the general manager of the Carolina
Comets.
David: I expect a phone call with an explanation.
I wince.
Fuck.
Usually, the organization is cool and doesn't give too much thought to
what you're doing as long as you're not breaking any laws.
But when you start making headlines…they start caring. And I know
this has already made headlines.
I click on the NHL app, and there it is, the first article of the day.
ADRIAN “THE BEAST” RHODES MARRIES BEAUTY
INFLUENCER RYAN BELL
I cringe at the nickname the media won't drop. It was something I got back
in my early days of hockey, and I haven't been able to live it down. I guess
that's what happens when you take a skate blade to the face and get cut just
an inch under your eye, through your lip, and down your chin.
The aftermath of that? Two surgeries, over a hundred stitches, and a big,
ugly scar that's changed everything for me.
So, yeah, I guess I do look like a beast.
I'm sure tacking on about thirty pounds and six inches and constantly
holding records for most hits in a season doesn't help.
I click away from the article just as a slew of texts come through, my
phone buzzing like crazy in my hand. They're coming in so fast I can
hardly keep up.
Britt: UR MARRIED
Britt: Is this sum joke????
Britt: Dammit! ANSWER ME! I've been calling you for 30
mins!!!!!
Britt: Srsly! Ur jealous I'm engaged to sum1 else, so u get
married in Vegas to sum slut??? GROW UP!
Britt: So glad I don't have to waste NE more time on u
Britt: Hope she's worth it bc WE R DONE
I want to text her back and remind her that we were done when she let
another man—especially my teammate—put a ring on her finger, but it's
pointless.
More texts appear, some I really shouldn't be ignoring, but I do anyway,
silencing my phone and setting it facedown so I can't see whatever else is
coming through.
I should get up. I should deal with this whole mess.
Instead, I close my eyes and force myself to lie back down, hoping this
is just one really bad nightmare.

RYAN
I am a self-proclaimed hopeless romantic. I love everything about love. The
meet-cutes, the soft touches, the shy smiles and subtle glances across the
room as you begin to fall in love. The slow, sweet build into something
epic. I'm even a fan of the ugly parts because, hey, that's what makes it so
special, right?
I love watching romantic comedies and those damn tearjerker sappy
love stories and reading romance novels. Valentine's Day is my favorite
holiday, and I truly believe everyone has a soulmate out there waiting on
them.
I naively thought I'd found mine with my ex-boyfriend, Steven, thought
all the troubles we were going through were just ugly parts that were
leading up to the big, beautiful ones.
But, man, I was way off.
Just hours before I hopped on a plane to Vegas with my best friend,
Harper, and her NHL superstar boyfriend and some teammates of his,
Steven texted me to tell me he was going to be a dad.
The only problem? I'm not pregnant.
It's safe to say our already troubled relationship was over after that.
I wish I could say I was responsible and did the mature thing, like send
him a congratulations text or something like that.
But no.
I did what most heartbroken women would do during a night out in
Vegas—I downed too much booze and danced with way too many men. I
drank and drank and…well, I still felt like complete shit.
The biggest gut punch was having to watch my best friend and her
boyfriend be happily in love all night. Don't get me wrong, I am thrilled
Harper found love. I've known her since our first year of college, and I
can't remember a time when she was this happy. She deserves it. Lord
knows she's pushed it away long enough.
But seeing her and Collin together…I broke. It made everything feel ten
times worse because I want what they have. I want that connection with
someone else. I want that closeness. I want that commitment.
I just didn't expect it to come like this…
On cue, the massive arm around my waist tightens and the body it
belongs to rolls, dragging me along for the ride. I push myself up, ready to
climb off him, but freeze when his breathing changes.
I wait, holding my own breath, but he doesn't open his eyes or move.
He's still sleeping.
I peer down, studying the man I'm currently straddling. When he's
awake, he's always sporting a scowl, and apparently, it's no different when
he's sleeping.
But glowering or not, there's no denying one thing—he's beautiful.
I thought it the very moment I laid eyes on him. It took me so long to
drag my eyes away that it made even me uncomfortable, which is a difficult
feat. That's how striking he is.
His long, dark lashes brush against his cheeks. His ochre hair, which is
in desperate need of a cut, is a complete mess, and there's a smidge of dried
drool at the corner of his full lips.
“I can feel you and your tits staring at me.”
I should be ashamed that I'm straddling him topless and staring at him,
but I can't seem to find any fucks to give about the situation.
I used up a lifetime's worth of embarrassment last night.
“Your wonky one is looking right at me.”
Even though he still has his eyes closed, I glare at him. “It is not wonky.
It's just…bigger. And only slightly.”
He peels his eyes open and glances down at my boobs, and I try not to
squirm as he blatantly stares at me…especially not with his dick beginning
to stir to life against my ass.
When he finally drags his eyes back to mine, he lifts a brow. “Why are
you straddling me topless again? Was last night not enough for you?”
A frown pulls at my lips. As embarrassing as it sounds, I can't clearly
remember what we did—or didn't—do last night.
His hazel eyes that are way too captivating fall to slits. “What? Upset
you slept with the ugly guy on the team?”
Well, I guess that answers that question.
I try not to roll my eyes at his words.
He's always doing that, always calls himself ugly.
Any ugliness about him has nothing to do with how he looks. It's all in
the way he acts.
Like a dick.
I try to push off him, annoyed. With him. With myself.
But he doesn't let me go.
I glare down at him. “What.”
Not a question. More of a Say something else asinine, I dare you.
He doesn't take the dare.
Instead, he loosens his grip and lets me go. I roll off him and settle on
the edge of the bed, facing away from him. I glance around, trying to find
any clues as to what the hell happened last night after we got back to his
room and I cracked open nearly all the bottles in the minibar and downed
them. It's all coming up dark though.
The parts before that? Those are a little less fuzzy, though I wish they
weren't.
I squeeze my eyes tight against the memories assaulting me and push
them aside.
Clothes, Ryan. Put your damn clothes on and get out of here before you
start freaking out.
I snap my eyes back open and continue my search. My bra is lying on
the coffee table. My short black leather skirt is on the dresser, my burgundy
velvet camisole is draped over the lamp, and there's one black stiletto on
the chair. I have no clue where the other one is.
I didn't pay much attention last night—or at least I don't think I did—
but this is easily the most extravagant hotel suite I've ever been inside. I
guess it's a perk of my best friend dating an NHL player, I suppose. You
start hanging out with them and getting to experience the finer things in life.
I do wonder how that lamp got broken though…
I push up off the bed and gather my things, including my phone that's
sitting on the dresser too. I make the mistake of tapping the screen. It's
filled with notifications. Like more than I've ever had before. Including one
from my brother, which means the news must really be out because he's a
world away and usually never all up in my business.
I power the device down, put off dealing with it, and begin to pull my
skirt up my legs.
From behind me, I can hear him moving around and sighing. I wonder if
he's checking his phone too.
“We didn't.”
His voice is soft, a little scratchy from sleep and probably the lack of
hydration considering how much we drank last night.
I snap my gaze to him. A big mistake because the sheet is now around
his waist as he sits on the edge of the bed, all those hard muscles he works
overtime for on display.
I swallow the lump forming in my throat. “What?”
“Last night…we didn't sleep together.”
He stands up, and I really wish he hadn't.
I wish he hadn't because now Adrian Rhodes, the top defenseman for
the Stanley Cup-winning Carolina Comets, is standing in front of me naked.
Naked naked. Like he has no care in the world that his cock is staring
directly at me.
And unfortunately for me, it's gorgeous.
Which is extra annoying because it's a dick. They can be pretty in
passing, sure, but they aren't supposed to make my mouth water. Not like
this.
He takes a step, and it bounces, knocking me over.
No, seriously—I'm now on my ass.
I am on my ass because I was so busy staring at his dick while I was
trying to put on a freakin' leather skirt—why did I think this was a good
idea?—and not paying attention to anything except the thing I want to lick.
Oh shit, am I still drunk?
Not lick—punch.
I want to punch him because Rhodes is a jerk. A complete ass. I mean,
he just called my tit wonky. That's asshole behavior if I ever saw it.
He doesn't rush over to help me. He just stands there naked as the day
he was born, watching me roll around on the floor like an idiot.
This is going swimmingly so far.
After taking entirely too long to do so, he finally asks, “Are you okay?”
I ignore him and continue trying to get my skirt pulled up. How I've
managed to get myself all tangled and am still on the floor, I don't know,
but I'm blaming Rhodes and his stupid, beautiful dick for this.
He lets out a hefty sigh as he pads across the room, his footfalls heavy
on the carpet my cheek is currently attached to—and not in a fun way.
His hands curl around my waist and he plucks me off the floor with zero
effort on his end.
He doesn't let me go. He holds me there, my skirt half around my
thighs, my back to his still obviously naked front.
We don't move for a long time, and the reality of…well, everything,
settles over us.
We didn't sleep together, but that doesn't erase everything else that
happened. Hell, I would have preferred if we had slept together. That would
have been better than what we actually did. Sleeping together is something I
can forget and move on from. Not like it would be my first one-night stand.
But this?
I squeeze my eyes shut. Maybe we didn't do it. Maybe it was all just a
really, really stupid dream. Maybe I'll wake up at any moment and all of
this will have been in my head. I'll be alone in my bed and I'll laugh and
laugh because there is no way I could possibly be this dumb.
His grip tightens, and I look down at his fingers curled around me.
There it is. The evidence.
It wasn't a dream.
We're married.
I pinch my eyes shut in an attempt to hold back the tears that have
started to sting my eyes.
We stand here for several moments, me trying not to cry, Rhodes
holding me against him. I still don't have a bra on, and the longer we stand
here, the more I'm unable to ignore his hardening cock that's brushing
against the small of my back.
I want to crack a joke about his boner just to lighten the mood, but I
doubt it would go over too well.
“Let go,” I say softly instead.
He doesn't. He tugs me closer and rests his head against mine, breathing
me in.
I let him.
I let him because deep down, I need this, and he knows I need this.
I hate that he knows.
“Please, Rhodes,” I beg, unable to take it anymore.
With another sigh, he releases me, and I finish pulling up my skirt.
I grab my bra from the coffee table and slide it on, followed by my shirt,
all while ignoring him as he (finally) pulls on a pair of underwear.
I find my missing shoe—it was in the bathroom—and slip that on too.
Rhodes doesn't speak to me until my hand is on the door handle.
“Are you okay?”
I pause, my back to him, and let out a sigh.
It's the same thing he asked me before.
“I'm not sure,” I tell him, because I'm not sure if I'm okay. I'm still
trying to wrap my head around…well, everything that's happened over the
last twenty-four hours. “We really…”
I don't finish the sentence. I can't.
He understands anyway. “Yeah.”
“And it's…” I say, turning to him. He nods, confirming my worst fear,
and I blow out a breath. “Okay.”
“Okay?”
I laugh quietly. “I don't really know what else to say, Rhodes.”
Another fucking nod. I'm starting to hate his nods. “Where are you
going?”
“My room. To change. We have lunch with Harper and Collin and the
guys before our flight tonight.”
He looks upset by my words like he was expecting something else. Like
he was expecting me to stay.
And really, I should. We have a lot to discuss. But if I don't get out of
this room right now, I might break.
I can't break.
“Right. Lunch. With everyone.”
His phone buzzes against the bedside table.
“Are they blowing your phone up too?” I ask.
“Of course. I have texts from Collin and your best friend.”
I squeeze my eyes shut. “What…what are we going to tell them?”
“You mean how the fuck are we going to explain that we're married
now?” He lets out a sardonic laugh. “I have no damn clue, but we should
talk.”
“I know. I just… Please, Rhodes. I…I need some space. Need to think.”
He doesn't say anything else, and he doesn't try to stop me either.
I pull open the door and walk away from my husband.

RHODES
It wasn't a dream at all.
The door clicks shut behind Ryan and I grab the thing nearest to me,
chucking it across the room.
“Fuck!”
The scream echoes off the walls as I shove my hands through my hair.
“Fuck, fuck, fuck!”
I pull at the strands over and over again like I'm trying to pull out some
magical fix for this fucked situation. But it doesn't work.
I need a shower. I need to think, need to clear my head. There has to be
some work-around for this.
I head into the bathroom, and just as I flip on the water, there's a
pounding on the door.
I sigh, already knowing who it is.
I ignore him too.
“Dammit, Rhodes, I know you're in there! Open the fucking door!”
He pounds on it, sounding like the police trying to break it down.
I switch off the water, not ready to face the music but needing to
anyway. The last thing I want to deal with on top of everything else is
security coming up here and busting my ass with a noise complaint.
I don't bother putting clothes on before pulling open the door to find a
scowling Collin on the other side, hand raised, ready to pound again.
He narrows his eyes. “Tell me it's a joke.”
Ignoring him, I turn on my heel, leaving him standing in the doorway
staring after me.
He sighs, then follows me into the room. I bet if he could, he'd slam the
door. He just stands there, hands on his hips like a grumpy old dad
disappointed in his son, and that's so much worse than the door slamming.
I'm disappointed in myself too.
I grab a bottle of water from the fridge and twist open the cap, bringing
it to my lips and chugging half of it in one go.
He continues to stand there staring at me, brows drawn tightly together.
I hold eye contact as I finish off the rest of the bottle, then crumple it up
and toss it to the side.
“What?” I finally ask.
He shakes his head, scoffing. “I can't believe you. I cannot fucking
believe you.”
I can't believe me either. It wasn't exactly my finest moment.
“Why? How?”
I lift my shoulders. “It sounded like a good idea at the time.”
“It sounded like a good idea at the time? That's the best you have?”
“Yes.”
“Whose idea was it?”
“Both.”
“Both of you? How? You were sober when you left with her and there is
no way a sober you would have made that decision. I know you.”
He's right. I wouldn't have.
“I was drunk.”
“Is that even legal?”
“Highly doubt it, but…”
He cringes, and I know he's already seen the video too.
He nods a few times, understanding just how fucked up this whole
situation is. He scrubs a hand over his face.
“I assume you saw the photo and that's what sparked this.” It's not a
question, more of a statement.
“Unfortunately.”
When I saw the photo of Brittney and her engagement ring, I was hurt.
But I was even more shocked when I realized it was my own former
teammate in the photo with her.
I had no idea they even knew each other, though I guess I shouldn't be
too surprised. Colter isn't the greatest guy out there. He has two baby
mamas he hardly ever talks to, and last year he did nothing but pick fights
with just about everyone on the team. I think nearly everyone breathed a
sigh of relief when the Comets traded him earlier this summer.
“Colter is such a fucking piece of shit, and Brittney is…well, she's
Brittney. Of course she'd do this to you.”
Collin hated Brittney from the moment he met her, and I think it's safe
to say he was right in his initial displeasure. He tried to warn me away
several times, claimed she was never in it like I was and just wanted my
money and the clout of dating a “celebrity.” I dismissed him every time
because I thought for sure one day we'd get over the back-and-forth of our
off-and-on relationship and settle down.
Maybe if I had listened to him, I wouldn't be in this mess.
He doesn't understand though. It's easy for him to put himself out there.
Sure, we both play pro hockey, so we have that going for us, but for me, it's
more complicated than walking up to a hot chick and going, “Wanna see my
hockey stick?”
Before my injury, I used to be confident, even a little cocky. Now? This
scar is the first thing everyone sees when they look at me, and the first thing
I see is the sympathy in their eyes.
You always think having a scar from doing something badass would be
fun, but I promise you it gets old quickly. The story gets old. The pitying
looks get old. The recommendations of scar creams get old.
Collin…he doesn't know what that's like. He doesn't understand how
hard it is to get somebody to look at me like I'm more than my scar. To find
someone who isn't bothered by it and isn't embarrassed to be seen with me
in public or pictures.
Brittney never cared about it. Or at least I didn't think she cared.
But going by the dude she had her arm wrapped around in the photo,
she wasn't looking to settle down with an ugly guy like me.
Ryan, though, I know she doesn't care.
“I like your scar,” she says, the smell of tequila hitting my nose. “It
makes you look distinguished.”
“I think you mean disfigured!” I shout over the loud music of the club.
We've each had about four shots in the last hour, and I feel looser than I
have in a long damn time.
She grabs my chin and pulls my face to hers, her green eyes that I'm
really starting to like boring into me. “You're beautiful, Rhodes. Not despite
your scar, but because of it.”
It was the first time someone had ever called me beautiful.
I'm sure she didn't mean it. I mean, hell, she was three sheets to the
wind.
But still…it meant something.
“What are you going to do?”
“What can I do? It's already out there. You know better than anyone
how the internet is.”
The year before last, we blew our chances at the Cup in the finals.
Collin really blamed himself for what happened. After a night out at the bar
turned into a brawl, it was Collin who paid the price. He was arrested for
assault, and his name and mugshot were plastered all over the media. They
dug deep into his past and found out he'd been arrested as a teenager too. It
was a shitshow. The charges were eventually dropped, but the damage to his
reputation was done. He spent the entirety of this past season rebuilding
everything he had worked so hard for.
There's no way I can start this season with a similar cloud of chaos
hanging over my head, and announcing an annulment after a crazy weekend
in Vegas is exactly what that would be.
It isn't just about me. It would look bad on the organization and people
would assume they can't keep their players in check. I don't want to be that
guy who brings negative attention to the team.
“Think Coach is going to be pissed at me?”
“Coach? Think the entire fucking organization. Dealing with him was a
cakewalk compared to that mess.”
It's true. I remember hell raining down on Collin.
If you ask me, the media really screwed him over. His first arrest as a
teen was for protecting his younger brother after some idiots were bullying
him for being gay. His second arrest was for standing up to a drunken idiot
putting his hands on a woman. He should have been hailed a hero, not a
villain.
Needing more water, I reach back into the mini fridge, pop open yet
another bottle of overpriced water, and guzzle it down.
I drag the back of my hand over my mouth.
“Getting drunk married, man? Really?”
Fuck me if that bile doesn't sting the back of my throat again.
I force it down once more and reach for my third bottle of water. I'm
thirsty as fuck and need something to do with my hands before I punch a
hole in the wall and have to pay for that too.
I can feel Collin's gaze on me the entire time.
“You can't annul it. It'll look bad on you both.”
“I know.”
I crumple the empty water bottle and toss it toward the others and then
start hunting for my clothes.
This place is a wreck, and there's no doubt I'll be paying for the broken
lamp—courtesy of Ryan's stilettos that she slung off without a care in her
haste to undress—in the corner.
I doubt she remembers that either.
“You can't say it was just a joke because those records are going to be
out there, and they will find them.”
“I know.”
“You can't—”
“For fuck's sake, I know! Do you think I haven't run everything through
my head over and over again? I hardly slept last night because I was up
worried and trying to figure out how in the hell I'm going to fix this. So
save whatever bullshit you're about to spew for later.”
He doesn't back away. Doesn't drop my heated stare.
All he does is stand there.
“Collin…” I pinch the bridge of my nose between my thumb and
forefinger. “I fucking swear, I am about five seconds away from hitting
you.”
He sighs, then rubs his hand across the back of his neck, no doubt
kneading away the tension bunching there. “I'm sorry, I just… She's
Harper's best friend, you know? I feel protective of her.”
I nod because I get where he's coming from. I've been feeling the same
thing since the reality of this whole thing hit me. Ridiculous because we've
only been married since last night.
“Are you going to stay married to her?”
I gulp back the lump that's formed in my throat because I don't have an
answer to his question that's a good one.
There's a part of me that wants to stay married for the ease of it. I won't
have to deal with the organization breathing down my neck or my parents'
disappointment.
And in the very back of my mind, there's a small part of me that's
scared this will be my only shot at marriage.
I know I'm not a catch. Sure, I have the pro-hockey-player thing, but
that's it. I don't have looks. I don't have charisma. Most times, I'm an
outright dick.
So, this? It could be my only chance.
I run a hand through my hair.
Fuck. I sound so soft right now. And crazy. Completely certifiable.
We can't stay married. There's no way…right?
“Rhodes?” he prompts again.
I blow out a long breath. “I don't know, man. I don't fucking know.
Guess it's time I talk to my wife.”

RYAN
“Let's look on the bright side—at least the man I married is hot.”
“Ryan Felicity Bell!” Harper admonishes. “How can you joke at a time
like this?”
I lift my shoulders. “What am I supposed to do? Cry about it?”
“Anything would be better than just sitting here stoically like you have
been for the past twenty minutes only to have the first thing you say be a
damn joke.”
Harper isn't usually the type to get upset so easily, but I can tell right
now that she's mad.
What I can't tell is if she's mad at me or if she's mad at the situation for
me.
When I left Rhodes in his hotel room, I headed straight for my own. I
wasn't the least bit surprised to find Harper waiting outside when I arrived.
Collin took one look at me and shook his head. He muttered something
about Rhodes being an idiot and took off toward his floor.
He's been up there at least twenty minutes now, and I have no idea how
that's going for them.
“Can you maybe not yell at me? I've kind of had a long night.”
She winces. “I'm sorry, it's just…I'm worried.”
“You think I'm not? It's already online. I'm sure everyone and their
grandma knows about it by now.”
Except for maybe my grandmother, but that's only because she doesn't
know a tweet from a Facebook post.
Oh god—how am I going to break this news to her? I got married and
she wasn't even there!
The reason I love love so much is because of her and my grandfather.
They got married straight out of high school and were together for sixty
years. I spent more time at their house than my own growing up, and
watching them together was my favorite thing. Even after so long together,
they were still in love like they were on their honeymoon. My grandfather
brought home flowers every day and they danced in the kitchen after dinner
every night.
They made me a believer in all things good.
When my grandfather passed away two years ago, it broke my
grandmother. It was only a month later that she suffered a bad fall, broke
her hip, and had a concussion. She wasn't comfortable living on her own
after that and wanted to be around others her age.
She's been at an assisted living facility since, but she hates it. The
nurses are awful and her roommate is intolerable on a good day, but it's all I
can afford.
I don't want to add to her disappointment when she's already struggling
so much.
“Have you talked to him?” Harper asks, pulling me from my thoughts.
“Not yet.”
“You should.”
“I know. I just…I needed some space. Clear my head, you know?”
“I get that.”
Her phone buzzes in her hand and she looks down. I already know
whatever she's looking at, it has to do with me. She doesn't frown like that
for just anything.
“What is it?” I ask.
She tips the phone away from me. “Just more tweets.”
“Ughhhh.” I rub at my temples, my head pounding from the alcohol and
probably a little from the stress of everything too. “All I wanted was one
night of fun to forget about all the—”
I clam up, not finishing that sentence.
But Harper isn't letting me off that easy. “Forget about all the what?”
Sharp as ever, her eyes narrow. “What don't I know, Ryan?”
I scrub a hand over my face, realizing I now have to confess my
troubles. “Look, I was going to tell you after the trip, but…” I exhale. “I'm
fucked.”
She screws her lips up, confused. “O…kay?”
“I was let go at the salon last week.”
“What?!” she explodes, pacing back and forth in front of me. “Why?
What the hell happened?”
I shrug. “I guess the owner of the building came by to negotiate rent and
it did not work out well for the salon. Macy needed to make some cuts, and
since I'm the only one without any dependents, I was let go.”
“But…but you're the best one there!”
“I know, but since I'm kind of a one-trick pony with my makeup skills
and the other girls can do it all, it just made the most sense.”
She shakes her head. “That's such bullshit.”
“I get where she's coming from. Besides, she knows I have my income
from my videos and whatever photography I'm able to sell.”
“Still. It sucks.”
“It does, but that's not even the worst of it. Rent hikes are a big thing
this year because the cost of my grandmother's assisted living is going up
too.”
Her face falls. “No.”
“Unfortunately, yes.”
She comes to sit next to me, wrapping an arm around my shoulders.
“Oh god, Ryan. I am so sorry. I… What are you going to do?”
“I'm not sure. I guess since I'm not at the salon anymore, I can make
more videos.”
“That's what you wanted to do all along anyway, so maybe this is a
good thing?”
“True, but I wanted to get some savings built up a bit first, make a solid
plan. You know better than anyone how much a small business can ebb and
flow.”
“So true.”
Harper has a very…niche set of skills. She loves anything and
everything horror related and decided to turn that into a very profitable
business selling handmade items online. She makes home décor, trinkets,
and even some props for movie sets that she ships all over the world. The
things she makes are super creepy, but she loves it.
I always found it funny that we ended up becoming such great friends
since we're total opposites. She's obsessed with the horror genre, and I
jump at my shadow sometimes.
“Is that why you were drinking so much? Because you were upset?”
I nod. “Yes. It's dumb, but…between losing my steady income at the
salon and the price of my grandmother's care going up, and then add in the
whole Steven thing…well…” I shrug.
“You needed an escape. I get it. But can I just say maybe you went a bit
too far?”
I laugh. “I think that's a fair assessment.”
“What exactly happened? One minute he was tossing you over his
shoulder to take you back to your room, and the next thing I know, you're
married. How'd you go from that to the altar?”
“He started to take me back to the hotel but said he didn't want me to
choke on my own puke, so he wanted to sober me up some first. Which I
guess is sort of sweet in a Rhodes kind of way.”
She laughs because she knows I'm right. Rhodes and sweet do not go
together.
“I kind of broke the news to him about that girl he's been seeing getting
engaged.” I cringe thinking about it. Nobody should find out that kind of
thing via social media. “He said he wanted to get a drink and dance and
have fun. After that, it's mostly blurry.”
“Okay, for one thing, I cannot imagine Rhodes dancing. Like at all.”
When he first suggested it, I couldn't imagine it either. He's a big,
scary-looking guy. No way could I picture him on the dance floor.
But I remember the feel of his hands on my hips as we danced together
in the club. The way he held me to him like he never wanted to let me go.
He runs his nose along the exposed column of my neck.
“Are you sniffing me?” I shout.
“Yes. You smell incredible.”
“I do not! I smell like sweat!”
He spins me around, my body crashing into his. He keeps his hands on
my waist, pushing his knee in between my legs. My leather skirt rides up my
hips and I'm practically exposed.
But I don't care.
Not when he keeps grinding against me and my clit grazes against his
leg.
He drags his nose along my jawline, all the way up to my ear.
“You argue too much, Ryan. Someone ought to spank you for it.”
“Are you offering?”
“Yes.”
Images of Rhodes standing over me and my ass stinging red from his
palm flash through my mind. A small noise escapes me, and I pray he didn't
hear it.
I pull back, grinning up at him, trying to mask the fact that he's making
me think some very naughty thoughts right now.
“Don't tease, Rhodes.”
“Who said I was teasing?”
“You got this faraway look on your face. Were you thinking about
Steven again?” Harper asks.
“Don't pretend you care about Steven.”
“Oh, I don't. I hate that guy.”
I laugh. I can't really say I blame her. He wasn't a great boyfriend. He
never called when he said he would, he was always ditching me for his
friends, and he always talked to me like he was better than me because he
was a published photographer. No matter how hard I tried, I was never
enough for him. I guess that's what I get for dating a self-centered artsy
asshole.
“But I care about you, and I am sorry you're hurting because of him.
I'm more than happy to help you bury his body though.” I smile. “Did you
ever find out how long they've been together?”
“I might have done a little social media stalking and saw on her
Instagram that they met at his gallery opening a while back and hit it off.”
Harper's brows crush together. “His gallery opening? You mean the one
last year at the beginning of the season?”
I can't help but smile. “Look at you, talking all hockey seasons and
stuff.”
She blushes. “Stop it. You better not tell anyone I can talk sports now.”
We can laugh about it now, but when Harper and Collin met on a dating
app, Collin dropped so many hints about him being a hockey player. Harper
being Harper, not knowing a damn thing about sports, didn't pick up on a
single one.
Now I bet she can recite Collin's stats better than he can.
“Is that the same gallery opening though?” she presses.
I nod. “The same one.”
“But that means…” Her eyes widen. “Does that mean he's been seeing
her this whole time?”
I don't know, and I'm honestly not sure I want to know.
My gut is telling me yes though.
Based on the way Harper is looking at me, hers is saying the same
thing.
She squeezes my hand again. “At least tell me he had a small dick.”
My mind goes straight to the dick I saw this morning, which was
definitely not small.
I push the thought away, hoping Harper doesn't see the blush that is no
doubt stealing up my cheeks.
“Average, and there was a weird mole on the inside of his thigh that had
more hair than my legs in the winter.”
She wrinkles her nose, and I laugh.
Then somewhere along the way, my laughter turns to tears, and before I
know it, I'm full-blown snot crying into Harper's shoulder.
I have no idea how long it takes for me to gather myself, but when I
finally pull away, there is a definitive wet spot on her shirt.
“I snotted on you. I'm sorry.” I wipe at it with a soft laugh, and my eyes
instantly drop to the ring sitting snugly on my finger.
Harper notices and drags my hand into her lap, examining the ring
Rhodes slipped on last night with a promise to love me forever. It's a simple
slim gold band with a small heart engraved in the middle of it. Nothing
fancy and nothing like how I imagined my wedding ring would look.
“It was something they had at the chapel,” I tell her with a shrug. “He
got one too.”
“At least you didn't get it tattooed on,” Harper comments with a laugh.
“Or sleep with him.”
Just the mere mention of a naked Rhodes has my mind drifting back to
seeing him naked.
On one hand, I'm glad I didn't sleep with him last night. On the other…
damn, what a missed opportunity.
Harper waves her hand around. “Okay, I know your horny face when I
see it. What aren't you telling me?”
Busted.
I wring my hands. “I, uh, might have seen him naked.”
“What! When? I thought you didn't sleep together.”
“We didn't, but when I woke up this morning, all I had on were my
panties and Rhodes was naked as the day he was born.”
She lifts her brows but doesn't say anything. Probably because once
upon a time—before I knew what a grumpy asshole he is—I thought he was
hot.
Then he spoke, and all that flew right out the window.
There's a knock at my hotel door and I freeze, worried I conjured him
up by thinking about his cock. I have this weird wave of wanting it to be
Rhodes and simultaneously wanting it to be literally anybody else.
“It's just me,” Collin says.
I exhale a relieved breath, and Harper gets up to let him in.
They stand in the door whispering for a few moments, glancing over at
me from time to time. Subtlety is not their specialty.
Harper nods, then turns back to me. “We're supposed to meet Lowell
and Miller for lunch, but I'm going to stay here with you.”
“No!” I say, almost too quickly. “I mean, no. Go on ahead. I'll meet you
down there.”
Harper's brows pinch together. “Are you sure? I don't want to leave you
alone.”
“It's fine. I'm going to take a shower and map out the next big mistake I
can make with my life.”
Her face falls, and I laugh.
I laugh because if I don't laugh about it, I'm going to start crying again,
and I don't want to cry in front of Collin.
Especially not when he's looking at me like he is. Like I'm some
wounded animal.
I'm not wounded. Just stupid.
Really, really stupid.
“I swear, you're out to give me a heart attack this weekend,” Harper
mumbles as she crosses the room. She wraps me in her arms, and I hug her
back. “We'll figure this out,” she promises. “You're Ryan the Lion. You've
got this.”
I smile at the nickname she gave me in college. She was always the shy,
awkward, quiet one, and I was always the exact opposite of that. She
always said I was bold and brave like a lion, and the name kind of stuck.
“I'll be fine. I'll meet you down there in thirty,” I tell her, hoping my
words sound convincing enough.
She gives me one last long, sad look, then shuffles out the door with
Collin. Like the amazing boyfriend he is, he looks equally concerned about
my well-being.
The moment the door clicks shut, I fall back on the bed, exhausted from
last night and all the emotions of the day so far. I glance over at the clock
and note that it's only eleven. How can it only be eleven?
Twelve hours.
That's how long I've been married. Twelve hours. And I remember this
because we made sure to say our vows at 11:11 PM.
I thought it was romantic. Something out of a fairy tale.
I believe in love, and I believe in fairy tales, but this?
This is no fairy tale.
It can't be. Not when it makes me feel this way, sick to my stomach
with dread.
Maybe that's just the alcohol though. I should probably eat something,
but just the thought of food makes me want to hurl.
A bath—that's what I need. If I'm quick, I can take about a fifteenminute soak to let all the tension out of my body.
I'm just about to push up from the bed when the sound of a key sliding
into the electronic lock stops me in my tracks.
I'm sure it's just Harper checking in on me. We always make sure to
exchange room keys just in case, but this is the first time I'm regretting that
choice.
I just want to be left alone. I want to sit in a tub of hot water and think
about how the hell I'm going to get out of this mess I'm in. Hell, maybe I'll
order room service and charge it to my husband's room. I can do that, right?
What's his is mine and all that.
The door opens, and I sigh. “I told you, Harper, I'm fine.”
“Yeah, well, I'm not. We need to talk.”
It's not Harper. It's Rhodes.
And he doesn't look happy.
“Got a moment to chat, wife?”
6
RHODES
“I don't know where she is. She said she'd meet us here, but she's not
answering her phone.”
I know because I tried it too.
Is she trying to bail on me?
“Give her some space, man. Maybe she just needs time to process.”
Collin places a hand on my shoulder, and I shake it off.
I also needed time to process, but Collin had no issue with dragging my
ass down here for lunch with Lowell and Miller. If I have to be here and
face everyone right now, she damn sure has to be here too.
We both fucked up last night. I'm not going to let her hide just because
she's too embarrassed to own up to her mistakes.
Without another word, I spin on my heel and head for the elevators.
Harper calls out after me, but I don't bother stopping. I'm a man on a
mission, and it's time I had a chat with my wife.
I take the elevator up to the thirty-fifth floor and let myself in with the
key card I have.
I hear her sigh as I push open the door.
“I told you, Harper, I'm fine.”
“Yeah, well, I'm not. We need to talk. Got a moment to chat, wife?”
I say it just to test her, and to her credit, she doesn't flinch.
Nor does she look all that surprised to see me.
“How did you get in here?”
I hold up the card. “You dropped this in my room.”
That's a lie. The first thing I did when Collin finally left my room was
go to the front desk and get a replacement. They really have some shitty
service in this hotel. I barely had to talk my way into getting it.
“How convenient.”
“Sure was.” I shut the door behind me. “We need to talk.”
“You already said that.” She pushes off the bed with a sigh, heading into
the bathroom.
She gathers her long, honey blonde locks and twists them up into a
messy bun and then bends over the garden tub. She hits a few contraptions
and switches on the water. She reaches for a bottle of bath salts sitting in the
corner and dumps the entire thing into the bottom of the tub. Another bottle
of the stuff is emptied, and before I know it, she's hooking her thumbs into
the waistband of her skirt and tugging it down her legs.
Her shirt is lying on the floor next to it before I can even grasp what I'm
seeing.
“What are you doing?” I finally manage to ask.
“What does it look like? I'm taking a bath.”
She says it so calmly, like she's not just undressing in front of me and
slowly killing me.
“Nothing you haven't seen before.”
“I told you we didn't sleep together.”
Quite frankly, it's pissing me off that she thinks I would take advantage
of her when she was drunk. I might have been shit-faced too, but that's not
the kind of man I am.
“We might not have slept together, but I clearly undressed in front of
you at some point last night, so unless you're unable to handle seeing some
boobs…”
Some boobs? She says it like she doesn't have an incredible rack.
I try my damnedest to look away when she reaches behind her back and
unsnaps her bra, but like a flustered eighth-grader who is seeing tits for the
first time, I look at the mirror, as if that's going to magically change
anything.
She doesn't back down, doesn't call me out on it.
Our eyes collide in our reflections as she drags her bra down her arms
and drops it to the floor. She's back to the same state she was in when she
was straddling my waist this morning.
And just like then, my cock springs to life.
Her perky tits are hanging free, her nipples hard and in perfect
proportion to the rest of her boob. Fuck, I want to taste them. So damn
badly. I had to fight so hard not to reach up this morning and pull her breast
into my mouth.
Just like I have to fight the urge right now.
She's beautiful. There's no denying that. I thought it the first moment I
saw her.
But it's more than just her looks that make her beautiful. It's the
unabashed confidence she has in herself. The way she presses her shoulders
back and meets my stare head-on, almost daring me to touch her.
I admire that about her.
Her watchful gaze skates across our reflections and lands on the one
thing I hate the most—my scar.
It's only then that I finally turn away from her and not-so-subtly adjust
my hard dick.
She turns off the water, and I hear her step into the tub.
“You wanted to talk, so let's talk.”
I face her again just as she sinks under the bubbles, covering everything
I so desperately wish I could see again.
Leaning against the bathroom counter, I cross my arms over my chest,
watching her. Her eyes are closed, and to most, she might look at ease. But I
can see the way her jaw is tensed and how her lips are tugged down in the
corner just the slightest bit.
“Last night was—”
“A huge mistake? Like monumentally huge? The biggest regret of my
life?”
Even though I'm harboring those exact feelings, there's something
about the way Ryan says it that cuts just a little bit.
Could it be because she's embarrassed by me? That out of all the people
she could have done this with, I had to be the guy?
“Yeah, that.”
She lets out a humorless laugh and sinks lower into the tub, keeping her
eyes closed. “We're trending on Twitter, you know.”
Fuck. Of course we are.
Which means it's as bad as I thought.
“What are we going to do?” She whispers the words, but I hear them
just fine across the bathroom.
“I think we should stay married.”
Just as fast as the statement leaves my mouth, she's scrambling around
the tub, completely shocked by it.
I'm shocked by it too.
“Are you insane? We cannot stay married.”
The way she says it makes it sound like she's disgusted by the idea,
which just pisses me off.
“We barely know each other, Rhodes!”
“I guess you should have thought about that last night before you said I
do.”
“I was drunk.”
“So was I, but you don't see me running from my mistakes.” Probably
because I'm an idiot, but…
She shakes her head. “You're nuts. We can't stay married.”
“Why not?”
“Why not? More like why should we?”
Marriage has always been something important to me. It's not like I've
ever been in any rush to get down the aisle, but it's never been a thing I've
not taken seriously either—at least not until last night.
I've seen other guys in the league not take it seriously too many times to
count. They screw women all over the country and show off that Instagramworthy life at home, pretending they aren't sticking their dicks in anything
that walks the moment they are away. It's a joke to them.
But not for me. It means something, a lifetime of sticking by someone
who complements you in all the best ways. It's a true, honest commitment.
It definitely does not mean a quickie in Vegas with an Elvis impersonator at
the ready to help you exchange your vows. We didn't go that route, thank
fuck. Apparently even drunk we have some class when it comes to a Vegas
elopement.
I'm already that guy with the ugly scar. I can't also be that guy who got
married in Vegas.
And more than that, I don't want to be that guy.
“Because you need me, and I need you.”
“I don't need you.”
I laugh darkly. “Oh, but you do need my help. I might have been drunk
last night, but I distinctly remember you telling me about losing your job
and your troubles about your grandmother's assisted living situation.”
Her mouth drops open. “I told you about that?”
“Yes. How you're barely hanging on paying for it and you want nothing
more than a Prince Charming to come and save you. Ring any bells?”
It's clear that it doesn't.
But I remember it very well.
She cried for a good twenty minutes about it. I remember because if
there's anything in this world that I hate, it's lady tears. Well, I also hate
having to block shots going a hundred miles an hour on the ice, but I
fucking hate lady tears too.
I've only seen my mother cry in a handful of instances, and it has about
killed me every one of those times.
“Is that…is that why we got married?”
“I…”
Fuck. Collin asked me the same thing.
Why'd we do it?
As sad as it sounds, I don't know.
I know I was upset about Brittney. I know I wanted to forget her
engagement to Colter and maybe even show her I was over her. But I don't
think that's the reason we did it. It doesn't feel like the reason we did it.
But I was drunk, so what do I know.
I just know that try as I might, I can't remember, and I'm not sure
whether that's a good or bad thing.
“I, uh… Well, I don't actually know the exact reason we got married.” I
rub at the knot forming at the back of my neck. This shit is stressing me out.
“I don't remember much leading up to it.”
She seems sad yet relieved to hear that. “Well, at least we're on an even
playing field there.” She shakes her head. “I can't believe I told you about
my grandmother. Not even Harper knows the full extent of it.”
“Well, believe it. You did. And I can help you with it if you help me
with my problem.”
“What problem?”
I wave my hand between us. “This. There's an expansion team coming
in out west, and I don't want to be on the chopping block for it. If I'm doing
stupid shit like this during the offseason, it's not going to look good. I'll be
a liability and they won't keep me, and I'd really like to stay.”
It's not a lie at all. Everyone knows they're on thin ice this upcoming
season.
“Not to mention it's already out there in social media land and everyone
knows the internet is forever,” I continue. “I'm sure the entire Comets
organization knows about it already, so I'd have to deal with that shitstorm
too. And then there's the whole letting-my-parents-down thing that I'd
really like to not do.”
“You can't be serious about this.”
I don't say anything because as much as I don't want to be, I am
serious.
Her face falls, and it finally dawns on her that I'm not kidding at all.
“Rhodes…”
She clamps her mouth shut, rolling her lips tightly together as she
studies me, mulling it all over in her head.
I wait. I wait for her to tell me to go fuck myself. I wait for her to leave
me high and dry to deal with this myself.
I wait for her to tell me she can't possibly imagine being married to a
man like me.
Her lips pop free and I brace myself, ready for it.
“Okay.”
I balk at her response. “Okay?”
She nods. “I'll do it. But we need to make a plan.”
“A plan?”
“Yeah, like how long are we going to stay married? How long are we
going to keep this charade going?”
I run my hand over my jawline, scrubbing at the stubble that's formed in
the last twenty-four hours. I don't typically keep any facial hair because it
draws too much attention to my scar, but I couldn't be assed to shave this
morning. Now I'm glad for the distraction.
I really haven't thought this far ahead. I just figured we'd ride out the
social media storm for a few months and then figure things out from there,
but dealing with everything during hockey season…well, I can't do that.
“The season maybe? I have to focus on hockey, and I can't deal with a
divorce and other drama in the middle of that.”
She scoffs. “You say that like I'm going to drag you through the mud
and take you for all you have like some kind of gold-digging monster.”
I don't refute her claim because I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little
worried about that. I know Ryan, but I don't know Ryan. I have no idea
what she's capable of, and people do some sketchy shit when they are
desperate. Since I don't have a way out of this situation other than seeing it
through, I'm going to protect myself as much as I possibly can, which
means focusing solely on my divorce when it comes time for that.
Divorce. The word tastes awful in my mouth.
It's crazy to think we just got married last night and we're already
talking about it like we're discussing what groceries we need to buy.
But that's what we have to do, isn't it? We have to keep this
professional and businesslike. The last thing we need to do is bring any sort
of emotions into this mess.
“And if you make it to the playoffs? That'll be like a year…”
Doesn't she know she's going to jinx it by implying we won't make it?
“When,” I correct her. “If you're going to be married to a hockey player,
you should know we're a bit superstitious. So, when we make the playoffs,
we'll reevaluate things.”
She laughs humorlessly. “Reevaluate things. I can't believe that's how
I'm talking about my marriage.”
I can't either.
“What are we going to do about our families?” she asks.
I groan just thinking of how my mother is going to go full-blown
batshit. “Make them believe it, I guess. What about your parents? Will they
care?”
“They aren't…part of my life. It's just me, my older brother who is off
doing Marine things in Okinawa, and Grams.”
The nonchalant way she says it makes me feel uneasy and a little sad for
her. My family isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but I couldn't
fathom not having them in my life.
My mom is loud and a little overbearing at times, and my dad can kind
of get on my ass about my hockey stats, but they love me and support me. I
don't know where I'd be without them.
“All right,” I say. “We lie, then.”
“We lie,” she agrees. “Other than Harper and Collin, nobody can know
this is fake. We have to play it up if we want to make it believable. Your
family, teammates, your coaches—nobody can know the truth. Can you
handle that?”
Handle that? Please. I'm the king of faking it until I make it.
“The GM might kill me, but it shouldn't be a problem.”
“Maybe you should get my name added to your life insurance policy
before we go back, just in case.”
Oh look, she's got jokes.
“Do Lowell and Miller suspect anything?” she asks.
“I don't know. I haven't talked to them. Lowell certainly isn't stupid, so
I'm sure he knows something is up. Miller, on the other hand…well, he's
Miller.”
I love the rookie. He has some seriously sick hands out on the ice and is
a big reason our team won the Cup, but he can be a bit dense sometimes.
Ryan laughs, understanding what I'm getting at, and it's the first real
laugh I've heard from her since we got into this mess. I don't hate the sound
of it.
“If we're going to pull this off, I think it goes without saying we won't
be seeing other people during this whole sham of a marriage.”
She eyes me, waiting on my answer anxiously. I want to be annoyed
that she would even suggest I'd step out on her, but to be fair, with the way
we got married, it's clear I'm not the best at making decisions.
“Of course not.”
“Good, good.” Her shoulders sink with relief, and she clears her throat.
“And our living situation? What about that?”
“We'll live at my house, of course.”
The look she gives me says she wouldn't share a room with me even if
she had to.
I don't know why I say that last part. It just comes out, but I realize I
mean it.
“You have a house?” she asks, and I drag my eyes away from her body.
If she noticed me staring, she doesn't call me out on it.
“Yeah, where did you think I live? In a box somewhere?”
“Or hell.” I ignore her jab and her proud smile. “Possibly even in an
apartment. Some bachelor pad for sure.”
“No apartment. No bachelor pad. I just bought a three-bedroom house
over in Grandview Hills.”
She lifts her brows at the name of the neighborhood, which is known for
being a bit ritzy. I didn't choose the place because of that; I just liked the
privacy that came with it.
I'm not the type to have my business and my name splashed across the
headlines. For someone who plays a professional sport, I live a low-key life.
With this scar marring my face, I already give people enough reason to pay
attention to me. I don't need to add to that, which of course makes this
whole situation even worse. I have a feeling I don't even want to know
what they're saying about us online right now.
“What do you need three bedrooms for? It's just you, isn't it?”
I lift my shoulders. “I like having the space, especially when my family
comes to visit.”
Which they do often, and that's going to suck.
“Are you close with them? Your family, I mean.”
“Yes. They gave up everything for me. I owe my entire career to them,
and I make sure they know it, flying them out for games as often as
possible.”
She nods once, her eyes full of something I can't quite place my finger
on. “Your place it is, then.”
“All right. Any other stipulations?”
“Yes. I want my own bedroom, there will be no PDA, and I'm not
taking your last name.”
“Even if this were a real marriage, I wouldn't expect you to. It's your
name—you do what you want with it.” Her eyes widen at my response,
surprised by it. “Did I say something wrong?”
“No.” She shakes her head. “I just thought you might argue. That seems
to be your thing with me. I say something, you say something snarky back,
then walk away all hot and grumpy.”
I lift a brow at her choice of words. “Hot and grumpy?”
She rolls her eyes and sinks lower into the tub. The bubbles are nearly
completely gone, and if I were standing any closer, I could see everything.
I really want to see everything.
“If there's nothing else, you can leave now. I'd like to finish my bath in
peace.”
“Actually, there is one other thing I'd like to discuss.”
“Of course there is,” she grumbles, closing her eyes and relaxing into
the water that I'm sure is cold by now.
I stalk across the bathroom, not stopping until I'm hovering above her. I
was right; I can see everything. Every dip and every curve.
My fingers itch to reach out and touch her because I can clearly
remember how every inch of her feels under my fingertips. How my rough
palms dug into her soft flesh when I wrapped my hands around her waist
and held her against me.
She's fucking stunning.
From the way her breathing picks up, I know she can feel my eyes on
her body. And with the way her nipples pebble just under the surface of the
water, I know she likes it.
“Sex.”
Her eyes fly open. “Excuse me?”
“Sex. We'll be together for a year. You're going to want it.”
She snorts, turning her nose up at me. “With you? Not likely.”
Her words sting, but I'll never tell her that.
I lean down, resting a hand against the side of the tub. “Trust me, you
will.”
I place a few fingers on her knee that's poking out of the water. She
gasps just from the miniscule touch. I laugh darkly as I walk my fingertips
down her thigh and underneath the bath water, not stopping until I'm
dangerously close to her pussy. So close I can feel the heat coming off her.
Her legs part, begging me to touch her, and I'm not even sure she
notices it.
“But, Ryan?”
She makes a noncommittal noise, her eyes drifting shut as I inch closer
and closer.
“It's not going to happen.”
Without warning, I yank my hand from the water and flip the button on
the drain.
I shake my wet hand over the tub and grab the nearest towel, tossing it
at her.
“We have lunch plans. Get dressed, wife.”

RYAN
Are you allowed to hate your husband when you've been married for less
than twenty-four hours?
If so, I'm pretty sure I hate Rhodes.
I hate the way he stood over me, staring down at me with those hungry
hazel eyes of his. The way he drank in my body that I know he could see
through the cloudy water.
But what I hate most of all is the way my body reacted to his gaze.
Maybe I was wrong. Maybe it's not a good thing that my husband is
hot.
He's right—a year is a long time to be celibate. It's going to be hard, but
after that little stunt he just pulled, I'm determined to prove him wrong.
I won't want him. I can't want him.
Ugh, I can't believe I've agreed to this. I have to be crazy, don't I?
It was hard to tell him no when he was looking at me like he was. I
know he's worked hard for this career. Hell, he took a damn skate blade to
his face and still kept pushing to make his dreams happen. I don't want
some drunken mistake—especially since it's me—to put all that at risk for
him.
He's not the only person I'm doing this for, though.
My grandmother took me in and raised me when she didn't have to. She
gave up so much in her life for me. The least I can do is give up a year of
mine to repay her and make sure she's comfortable living out the rest of her
life.
One year, and he'll be gone most of it because of hockey season. I got
this.
I can see him from where I'm at. He's currently sitting on the end of my
bed, scrolling through his phone while waiting for me to finish getting
ready for lunch.
I get where he's coming from when he says we need to go, need to show
a united front. But I don't want to go. I don't want to face my mistakes from
last night. I suppose since we're going to be running this farce for an entire
year, we might as well start now.
“That video is…wow.”
I poke my head around the bathroom door. “You're looking at my
Instagram account?”
“Figured I should learn a few things about my wife. Your account is
popular.”
I hate the way he says wife—like it's a curse word.
“It's nothing. I'm small potatoes compared to some creators.”
“I'm pretty sure you have more followers than our team's account.”
It almost sounds like there's a little bit of pride in his voice, and I don't
know how to feel about it.
Unless it's coming from my grandmother, pride isn't something I'm
used to.
“It's nothing,” I say again. “I have more followers on YouTube
anyway.”
“Do you make money doing this?”
My hackles rise at the judgment in his tone.
I get it. Social media is the worst sometimes, and content creators get a
bad rap. It's not like I set out to have this as my career though.
In college, Harper and I took a special effects makeup class because we
thought it would be fun. I fell in love instantly and became obsessed with
watching makeup videos on YouTube. Before I knew it, I was making my
own. Ugh, those earlier videos are awful. Poor lighting, poor editing, and
even poor makeup. But with practice, I got better, as did the quality of my
videos, and eventually, I garnered some attention for turning myself into
different celebrities, creatures, and a few different Disney characters.
Things took on a life of their own after that.
I was able to monetize my channel and started to bring in an extra
hundred dollars a month. Now, it's in the thousands. It's nothing compared
to what some beauty gurus make, but it's generally enough to cover my
grandmother's care, which is not cheap. My parents aren't going to help
with the cost anytime soon and my older brother lives a whole world away
in Japan and is busy being a Staff Sergeant in the Marine Corps, so if this is
what I have to do in the meantime to pay for it, I'll do it—Rhodes'
judgment be damned.
“Not that it's any of your business, but yes, I do.”
He lifts a challenging brow. “Actually, it is my business, wife.”
I glare at him. “Well, in that case, since you're so worried about my
finances, I'll make sure to bring my bank statements to lunch for you to
look over. We can cry about my student loan debt together.”
He narrows his eyes, not appreciating my sarcasm.
“You still have student loans?”
“Yes.”
“I can pay those too.”
My stomach drops at his suggestion. “Is this some kind of Pretty
Woman situation to you? You're not paying my student loans.”
“But you're fine with me paying for your grandmother?”
I'm not fine with it. Not at all. I wish I could be the one to take care of
her, but I'm also not stupid. I'm not going to let an opportunity like this
pass me by.
I've already been running the numbers in my head. If I work my ass off
to post more content over the next year and save my money wisely, I should
be able to pay off the remainder of my student loans, and that'll take away a
big burden.
“You're not paying my student loans,” I say again.
He grits his teeth at my response, not looking the least bit satisfied.
“Fine.”
“Fine. Anything else, husband, or can I finish getting ready?” I toss the
word back at him with just as much disdain as he's been serving me.
“I don't want our life together on social media.”
His answer is quick and cagey, his whole demeanor changing. It's clear
he's uncomfortable with the idea.
My eyes drift toward his scar. I suspect that's his reasoning for not
wanting to be in the spotlight.
When he realizes what I'm looking at, he abruptly rises to stand, his
giant six-foot-four frame towering over me as he looks down his nose at
me.
“We're late.”
It's all he says, dropping the conversation before I have a chance to
answer him.
Okay, then.
I step back into the bathroom, apply one last swipe of mascara, and give
my hair a fluff, then turn off the bathroom light.
“Let's go,” I say, meeting his challenging stare head-on.
I do my best to ignore the way his eyes trail over my body. Just like I do
my best to ignore the way my nipples pebble under his gaze.
I grab my purse off the dresser and slide the strap over my shoulder,
following him out the door.
The ride in the elevator seems unusually long, and that same tension
that was in the room follows us through every floor. He stands opposite me,
hands shoved in his pockets, eyes never leaving mine.
It's like we've entered a staring contest, and at this point, I have no idea
who is winning.
When we arrive at the main floor, he blinks, looking away first. I don't
bother trying to hide my victorious smirk.
His fingertips graze the small of my back as we shuffle out of the
elevator. Just as quickly as they make contact, they're gone, and it's strange
because I miss them instantly.
Just as we're about to cross into the restaurant, his lips brush my ear,
sending a shiver down my back.
“Last chance,” he whispers, and I hear the challenge in his voice.
He thinks I can't do this. Thinks I can't handle this.
He has no idea just how strong-willed I am.
It's only a year, I remind myself. One year. That's it. You can do this.
Besides, it's not like my heart is on the line or anything. Piece of cake.
“I'm not backing out.”
His lips twitch, almost like he wants to smile. But he doesn't. Of course
he doesn't.
He just nods once and then straightens to his full height. “Let's do this,
then.”
Rhodes steers us through the restaurant toward the back where we are
greeted with a loud, obnoxious, attention-drawing cheer from none other
than Miller.
“Woo! Yeah! Congrats to the newlyweds!” He sticks his fingers in his
mouth, letting out a whistle. It's obnoxious and does nothing to help the
hangover headache I have.
Everyone's eyes are on us, and it's not like the restaurant is empty. A
few people whisper behind their menus, no doubt recognizing Rhodes.
I could maim Miller for his antics, and by the look on Rhodes' face, he
feels the same.
Lowell grabs his shoulder, pulling him back down to his chair. “Shut up,
you idiot.”
“What? I'm just happy for the newlyweds.” Miller shakes off Lowell's
attempt to rein him in and rounds the table, wrapping his arms around
Rhodes, patting him on the back. “So happy for you, bud.”
Rhodes gives him an Oscar-worthy performance and hugs him back,
even going as far as to pat him on the back.
“Thanks, man. Appreciate it.”
Miller lets him go, and then it's my turn for a hug. He wraps me in his
arms, his big body engulfing my small frame.
I meet Rhodes' gaze over Miller's shoulder, and he looks…angry?
That's not at all what I was expecting.
“I was hoping I'd have a shot with you,” Miller says as he lets me go.
He claps Rhodes on the shoulder. “But I guess that's out of the question
now.”
The sound that leaves Rhodes is nothing short of a growl.
An actual fucking growl.
I don't know how to feel about that.
Miller just laughs and heads back to his seat. Lowell rises from the table
and heads our way.
He gives Rhodes an almost imperceptible headshake but hugs him for
show. I can't read his lips, but I know whatever he whispers to Rhodes, he
does not like.
Lowell frowns down at me, and I somehow feel like I've disappointed
my dad. Ridiculous because he's only a couple of years older than me, but
it's the way he carries himself that makes me feel so small. No wonder he's
the team captain. He's scary as hell.
He gives me a quick hug, and we all take our seats. Rhodes and I are
directly across from Harper and Collin.
Harper gives me a sad smile and mouths, You okay?
I shrug because…am I okay? I don't know.
Unable to stand the way she's looking at me—like I'm a skittish kitten
about to run away—I turn my attention to the menu in front of me.
Miller turns to Rhodes. “Dude, I know I haven't seen you in a couple of
weeks, but I had no idea you two were dating, and I sure as shit had no idea
it was this serious.” He gasps. “Oh, fuck. Did you get her pregnant?”
The way he whispers pregnant makes me laugh, causing Rhodes to look
over at me. I ignore him.
“Shut the fuck up, Miller,” Lowell chides.
“What? It's a genuine question. How else do you explain a shotgun
wedding?”
Alcohol. Lots and lots of alcohol.
“Besides, it's not my fault I have pregnancy brain. My sister is knocked
up, and babies are all I can think about.”
“That's terrifying on many levels,” Rhodes comments, and I have to
agree.
“That's not how pregnancy brain works, you moron.” Lowell shakes his
head. “And you don't just ask women if they're pregnant. That's like rule
number one in life.”
Miller's cheeks turn a deep shade of red as he peeks over at me.
“Sorry.”
I jump a little when a hand wraps around mine. Rhodes laces our fingers
together, rubbing at the ring sitting on my finger. The same one he placed
there last night. “Not pregnant. We've kept it quiet, but we just couldn't
hold it in any longer.” He says it with such sincerity that even I almost
believe it. He grins over at me. “When you know, you know, right, babe?”
Ugh—babe. Gag me with a spoon.
Steven used to call me that, and I hated it then too.
“That's right, honey.” My words drip with just as much sarcasm as his.
His eyes flare at the pet name.
Good. Looks like he hates them too.
“Aww,” Miller says, “this is some shit right out of a romantic comedy.”
Rhodes and I exchange a glance because he has no idea just how close
to the truth he is.
Our server comes by and grabs our orders, saving us from answering
more questions about whether I'm knocked up or not. The conversation
around us flows easily, Miller moving on from grilling us about our
newfound love.
It's not until our food arrives that I realize I'm still holding Rhodes'
hand.
I think out of all the crazy things to happen so far this weekend, the
level of comfort I find in his touch might just be the hardest pill to swallow.

RHODES
After lunch, we all went our separate ways. I didn't even argue with Ryan
when she said she was heading to her own room. We should probably spend
some time getting to know one another, but I needed a break.
I needed a break because sometime during lunch I realized it felt a little
too comfortable to be sitting next to Ryan. That realization came when I
noticed I held her hand far longer than I needed to.
It felt…good. Easy.
Almost…right.
And that made me want to hurl my lunch back up, so I hid in my room
like a total wuss.
I sacked up and finally gave my general manager and coach a call to set
up plans for a meeting first thing tomorrow morning so we can go over a
press release. To say they were surprised by my sudden nuptials would be
an understatement.
That's one of the not-so-fun things about being a professional hockey
player. Everybody is all up in your business all the time, and there's a press
release for everything.
Some days I really question my decision to shoot for pro hockey, but
then I step out on the ice, and all the other bullshit I have to deal with fades
away.
Hockey is my life. I live it, love it, and breathe it. All this other bullshit
is worth it for those twenty minutes of ice time eighty-two nights a year.
Now I'm smashed between Lowell and Miller in the back seat of an
Uber. Ryan and Harper are sitting in the seat in front of us, and Collin is in
front, talking with the driver.
Lowell taps his legs against mine. He moves his eyes between Ryan and
me.
“You good?”
I shrug. Am I good? I don't know.
“Of course he's good!” Miller says. “Dude just got hitched. Please tell
me you're going to have a party to celebrate since it was so last minute and
none of us were invited. Not that I'm going to hold that against you or
anything.”
A party? My first reaction is a big Fuck no.
But…a party might not actually be a bad idea. It would give Ryan and
me a chance to introduce ourselves to everybody as a couple. Maybe it
could help break the ice a little bit too.
“Actually,” I say loud enough for Ryan to hear me, “I think a party
would be a good idea. Don't you think so, darling?”
I swear I hear Ryan roll her eyes at the pet name. I picked up pretty
quick that she is not a fan, and if she thinks I'm not going to keep using
them just to fuck with her, she's wrong.
When she turns around, she has a big, fake-as-hell smile pasted on her
face. “A party is a great idea, honey.”
My lips twitch at the pet name she tosses back.
“Fuck yes!” Miller shouts. “Party time!”
How he's excited to party after a weekend in Vegas, I have no idea. I am
all partied out. In fact, I could never party again and it would be too soon.
My phone vibrates in my pocket. I should probably ignore it, especially
since I'm sure it's just my mom calling again, but I decide to check it
anyway because I need the distraction. I can feel Lowell's gaze burning a
hole in the side of my head. I know he wants to talk about everything, but
I'm just not up for it right now.
Unknown: A party? Really??
It takes me a minute to catch on to who this could possibly be. Then the sad
reality of it hits me—it's Ryan.
I don't even have my own wife's number saved on my phone.
I add it in and text her back.
Me: Trust me, I don't want to do this either, but I think it could
help us. Get used to being seen together.
Me: It'll be good practice.
Ryan: Please tell me I'm not the only one who finds it
incredibly sad that we have to practice being a couple.
It is sad. So very fucking sad.
Me: It's not just you.
Ryan: When are we having this party?
Me: I guess after you move in. Maybe an end-of-summer
party?
Me: But I'm sure as soon as the press release goes out,
everyone's going to be on our asses about it.
Ryan: PRESS RELEASE?! What for?
Ryan: Oh. Never mind. I forgot for a moment that you're
famous.
Me: I'm not famous.
Ryan: Says the guy who randomly gets married in Vegas,
then trends on Twitter about it.
Me: You're not exactly unknown yourself, Ms. 500k Followers.
Ryan: Why do I feel like you're making fun of me for having a
social media presence?
Me: I'm not.
I'm really not making fun of her.
Do I understand it? No. But to be fair, all I do is play a game for a living
and get beat up by other grown-ass men.
We both have weird careers when you think about it.
Me: I think what you do is kind of cool.
Me: But your photography is more my style.
Ryan: You've seen it?
Me: At Collin's place. It's nice.
She's only sitting a row in front of me, so I see the surprise cross her face.
I'm not really sure how I feel about her being shocked that I complimented
her.
I meant what I said. Her photography is nice. Actually, it's more than
nice. It's pretty fucking incredible. The first time I went over to Collin's
place and saw the three-piece set of the bridge we cross every day to go to
the rink he has hanging over his fireplace, it took my breath away. Then he
told me Ryan did it, and that shocked me even more. From all the shit
Collin and Harper went through before, I knew she dabbled, but I didn't
realize how talented she truly is.
I really want to ask her why she doesn't take it more seriously, but I
don't feel like it's any of my business. Besides, I'm sure she has her
reasons, and she doesn't owe me any sort of explanation.
Ryan: Thank you.
Me: You're welcome.
Ryan: Okay, stop being nice. It's weird.
Me: I take great offense to that.
Me: I'm plenty nice.
She actually laughs out loud at my response, and it pisses me off.
Me: Did you just laugh because I said I'm nice?
Ryan: You're not nice. You're grumpy.
Me: I thought I was hot and grumpy.
Ryan: Oh my god, you're not going to let me live that down,
are you?
Me: Not a chance in hell.
Ryan: That's not very nice, husband.
Me: I thought you said I couldn't be nice, wife.
Ryan: You can be nice. Just not too nice. It's weird.
Me: Be nice but not too nice. Got it.
Ryan: You can add “Don't be annoying” to that list too.
Me: Now where's the fun in that?
Ryan: Are you finished being obnoxious?
Me: Nope, I'm just getting started.
Ryan: Wonderful.
Me: Just trying to keep your expectations of our marriage
realistic, dear.
Ryan: You are just too good to me, sweetums.
That one makes me laugh out loud.
“Oh, gross. Are you two sexting right now?”
Lowell groans next to me, tossing his head back with exasperation.
“Fuck's sake, Miller, shut up.”
Then he mutters something about why the hell we invited the rookie to
our weekend away.
He knows why. We wouldn't be on this celebration trip without him.
Annoying as he is, we need Miller.
Luckily, the driver pulls up to the airport before we have to hear any
more of Miller's bullshit.
Getting on our flight is quick and relatively painless. We only get
stopped for autographs twice when a few people recognize us as we make
our way to our gate.
I've grown so accustomed to flying on chartered jets that sometimes I
forget what it's like to walk through an actual airport and be recognized. I
don't typically do much traveling in the offseason. I tend to stay home and
hibernate. If I do leave North Carolina, the only place I ever go is back
home to upstate New York. Everyone there has known me since I was a
little kid, so none of them are impressed by my career.
When I climb on board, I see Miller casually stowing his luggage in the
bin directly above Ryan as if he's about to sit next to her. And because the
kid apparently has balls the size of Texas, he does. He plops down like it's
no big deal.
My brows slam together when he begins shuffling through his carry-on,
talking a mile a minute because that's what Miller does. He doesn't notice
that Ryan's not paying a lick of attention to anything he says.
She's too busy staring at me, the corners of her mouth tilted up into a
smile.
She thinks this is funny.
But I doubt she'll find it funny when her new husband gets escorted off
the plane for killing his teammate.
I step up in the aisle next to Miller and wait for him to realize I'm
towering over him. It takes him far longer than I expect. When he does
finally look up, his eyes are wide, and he realizes his mistake. It takes him
.2 seconds to unclip his seat belt and shove to his feet.
“Uh, shit, my bad, Rhodes. I forgot you two were married for a second.”
His cheeks are flaming red as he scuttles across the aisle to sit next to
Lowell, who just shakes his head at him.
I settle into my seat and then turn to Ryan, sending her a big toothy grin.
Now she's the one scowling as she turns away and focuses her attention out
the window like she's loving the view even though we're still sitting on the
tarmac.
The rest of the passengers file onto the plane, and after what feels like
forever, we're finally on the move. The flight attendants begin going
through their regular routine. I tune it out, having heard it a million times
before.
“Before we take off today, we would like to welcome two very special
guests to our flight,” the perky voice says over the intercom.
Now that draws my attention, and warning bells start going off in my
head. I glance over at Ryan, and she's sitting there with wide eyes too.
Oh fuck.
“Please join us in extending a huge congratulations to Ryan Bell and
Stanley Cup champion Adrian Rhodes on their marriage. Let's give them a
big round of applause.”
Everyone starts clapping, and I want to die.
I want to just sink into my seat and pull my cap lower over my face
when people start turning around to look at us.
Ryan's hand finds my thigh, and she digs her nails in deep. I look over
to find her with another fake smile plastered across her face as she waves at
everyone staring at us.
She's so good at faking that smile it makes me wonder how often she
practices.
“Smile,” she mutters out of the corner of her mouth, not once dropping
her grin.
“Huh?”
She digs her nails in deeper. “Smile, you idiot. Look happy.”
Happy? The only thing that would make me happy right now is a stiff
drink and for the earth to swallow me whole.
But we can't always get what we want.
So instead, I smile and wave, pretending to be blissfully in love right
along with her.
“Why aren't they turning around?” she asks out of the corner of her
mouth.
“No fucking clue, but I hate every second of this,” I say back, my
cheeks starting to hurt from smiling so much.
“Dude, kiss her! That's what they're waiting for!” Miller says, shoving
at my shoulder from across the aisle.
A few loud whoops go around, and I realize that is what they're waiting
for.
Because I don't think I can possibly take another second of everyone
staring at me, I slide my palm up Ryan's face and drag her closer to me.
There's no mistaking the angry fire blazing in her eyes.
“Rhodes…” she warns quietly just before our lips touch.
I ignore the warning and press my lips to hers.
She inhales sharply when our mouths connect.
But, to my surprise, she doesn't pull away.
She kisses me back.
As drunk as I was, I remember our kiss at the altar. How soft and pliable
her lips were. How sweet she tasted, even though the woman is full of fire.
But that drunken kiss? That drunken kiss was nothing compared to this.
Her lips are just as soft, and the taste of her is still sweet. But this time
something feels different.
We feel different.
Her fingernails dig into my thigh again, but this time for an entirely
different reason as she hums with pleasure. I slide my hand into her hair,
pulling her closer, slanting my mouth over hers just so.
Just as I'm about to deepen the kiss, she pulls away without warning,
stealing my breath as she goes.
She sucks in sharp breaths, eyes wide as she stares at me with surprise.
She doesn't have to tell me she felt it too. It's clear by the look on her
face that she did. The plane erupts around us again, everyone enjoying the
show.
Like the good actress that she is, she smiles and tucks a lock of hair
behind her ear, blushing and hiding her face from the attention.
Finally, everyone goes back to minding their own business, turning
around in their seats and ignoring us as they should have from the get-go.
But there's one stare I can't ignore.
I glance up and meet Collin's eyes. The look he's giving me…I don't
know what it means, but I do know I don't like it.
Ignoring him, I turn my attention back forward, grabbing the magazine
out of the back pocket of the seat in front of me and flipping mindlessly
through the pages.
I have no idea how many minutes pass until Ryan speaks.
“What the hell was that?” she hisses quietly.
I turn to find her staring daggers at me.
“A kiss.”
“I thought we said no kissing.”
“No. We said no PDA and no sex. I know I'm a good kisser, but I didn't
realize I was so good you mistook a kiss for sex.”
If possible, her eyes narrow even more. “From here on out, no kissing.”
“Afraid you might like it and want more?”
“No, I'm afraid I might vomit on you, and that won't look very good for
us, now will it?”
I lean into her until my lips graze the shell of her ear. “Based on the way
your nipples are poking through your shirt right now, I highly doubt that's
something I need to be concerned with.”
To her credit, she doesn't flinch or try to cover up when I call her out on
it.
She gives me a saccharine smile. “Kiss me again and I'll knee you in
the nuts.”
I won't lie, said nuts retract into my body just a little bit at the threat of
harm.
“We're going to be together for a year, Ryan. We can't just not kiss.
We're married. Married people kiss.”
She squeezes her eyes shut. “I really wish you'd quit reminding me of
that.” She lets out a resigned sigh. “You're allowed a max of one kiss a
week, but only if we're in a situation where it's warranted.”
I lift a brow. “Just one? Please. I give it a week and you'll be begging
me for more than that.”
“In your dreams, Rhodes.”
She pulls the hood of her jacket up over her head and leans against the
window, burrowing into her seat as far away from me as possible and
closing her eyes.
Of course she's a plane sleeper. I'm the exact opposite. I can never sleep
on a plane.
“You know, now really isn't the time for a nap. We should be discussing
the details of—”
She holds her hand up, cutting me off. “No. I need sleep to deal with
you. Wake me up when we're a half hour from landing. We can talk then.”
I want to argue with her, but much like her, I could use a bit of a break.
We're less than twenty-four hours into this marriage and I'm already
tired. And if the dark circles under her eyes are any indicator, she's tired
too.
“I can feel you staring at me, you know.”
“Just admiring your beauty is all,” I say with all the sarcasm I can
muster.
She flips me off, and I laugh.
I fold my hands across my stomach and rest my head back against the
seat. Even though I know I won't sleep, I close my eyes anyway.
I don't know how long it is before I hear a quiet, “Hey, Rhodes?”
“Hmm?” I respond, not opening my eyes.
“I'm sorry we're in this mess.”
I sigh. “I'm sorry too.”
I don't know why I do it, but I reach out and slide my hand over hers.
She doesn't pull away. Instead, she laces our fingers together, and I rub
the ring on her finger.
And for the first time ever, I sleep on the flight home.

RYAN
Rhodes kissed me.
Rhodes really kissed me.
And I kissed him back.
Like really kissed him back.
I knew what the people around us were waiting for, but I wasn't
expecting Rhodes to give in to their silent request.
I really wasn't expecting him to slide his palm up my cheek and bring
our lips together, nor was I ready for the charge that went through my body
when our lips met. Even though it's on video, I barely remember our kiss at
the altar, but something tells me no matter how good it was, there's no way
it was as good as the kiss on the plane.
I don't fly too often, but when I do, I have a secret superpower that I can
usually be asleep before takeoff. Yesterday, that was not the case.
Try as I might, I couldn't fall asleep with Rhodes sitting right next to
me, especially not after he kissed me the way he did.
So, I pretended to sleep while I held Rhodes' hand the whole flight.
As we left the airport, we didn't talk about it, and we're still not talking
about it now as he drives me back to my apartment with that same damn
scowl etched across his face, the air around us thick and full of unease.
It's like we have no idea what to say to each other.
If you ask me, it's ridiculous that I'm getting hung up on the fact that I
kissed and held hands with my own husband, but here we are.
“I didn't realize you live so close to the arena,” Rhodes says, breaking
the silence. “The rent out here must be astronomical.”
He has no idea.
I have a tiny one-bedroom, one-bathroom studio apartment, and I bet I
pay at least half of what his mortgage payment is, plus I make a whole lot
less than he does.
It used to not be so bad when I didn't have my grandmother's assisted
living care to pay for, but now living here does make things pretty tight.
I've tried looking for a new place over the years, but nothing beats how
close this is to my (former) job downtown and public transportation. If I
were to move, I'd have to get a car, which would be a whole other expense
to factor in, and I wouldn't be saving any money.
“This is me up here.”
I point to an empty spot just up the street, and Rhodes expertly parks his
SUV—which no doubt cost more than I've made in the last two years—
then turns off the ignition.
I make a move to get out, not wanting to be trapped in this tension-filled
vehicle any longer.
“Wait,” Rhodes says, reaching out to stop me.
I try hard to ignore how warm his fingers feel wrapped around my wrist.
I turn toward him, brow arched. “Yeah?”
He doesn't say anything for a long moment. He just stares at me, and
it's a stare that makes me uncomfortable. Like he's looking right down to
the very parts of me I keep hidden.
I don't like it.
“When did you want to get your stuff moved to my place? I've got a
pretty loaded schedule this week and want to get things sorted out.”
“Oh. Um, I hadn't really thought about it. I guess tomorrow. Probably
the sooner the better, right?”
He nods, then finally releases my wrist. I try not to think about how
cold it makes me feel.
“Yeah, tomorrow is good. I can call some movers today, get some stuff
set up.”
“Movers? I don't think we'll be needing movers.” I look around the
fancy vehicle. “I'm pretty sure everything I own can fit in your SUV.”
His brows rise. “Everything?”
“Yeah, probably. I don't really have that much. I'm a bit of a
minimalist.”
And broke, but he doesn't need to know that part.
“What about your bed? No way that will fit.”
Bed? He has no clue that my “bed” consists of two mattresses stacked
on top of each other in the corner of the room.
I've been frugal with my money over the last few years. Everything
extra I get goes toward my grandmother's care and my student loans.
Buying a new bed is very low on my list of things to do.
“We don't have to take that. You can buy me a new one.”
He huffs out a laugh. “That so?”
I shrug. “We'll call it a wedding gift since I didn't get a real wedding.”
He grimaces. “Do you want one? A real one?”
I've been planning my wedding since I was six years old when I used to
make my Barbies get married all the time. I know the dress I want to wear,
the flowers I want sprinkled everywhere, the centerpieces, the lighting, the
music…I have it all planned, and it's nothing like the wedding I had.
Do I want a real wedding? Yes.
Just not with Rhodes.
“No.”
He looks at me like he wants to press the issue, then thinks better of it.
“All right. No wedding. Just a bed.”
“A big bed. A sprawling bed. And a matching dresser.”
Because right now, my clothes are hanging on wire racks.
“A whole new bedroom set—got it.”
I sit back, satisfied with my requests. “Anything else, or am I free to go?
My cat is waiting upstairs for me.”
“You have a cat?”
“Is that a problem?”
“Does he like dogs?”
“She loves dogs.”
“Good. Because I have one.”
I don't know why, but this surprises me. I didn't really picture Rhodes
having any pets at all. I always pictured him living alone in a dark and
creepy castle on a hill.
“Well, I can't wait to meet her.”
“Him,” he mocks, and I narrow my eyes. “Tomorrow?”
“Tomorrow. I'll text you a time.” He nods. “Can I go now?”
“What? No kiss for your husband?”
“I'll kiss your nuts with my knee.”
He chuckles, but I see him not so subtly cover his junk.
I grab my bag from the back seat and hop out of the car, then climb the
stairs to my apartment building. Just as I'm opening the front door, I hear
his window roll down.
“Good night, my little sugar plum!”
With a groan, I slam the door closed.
I swear I hear him laugh.
Vivian Bell is a tiny woman, just shy of five foot two. She likely doesn't
weigh an ounce over a hundred and twenty-five pounds, and she's 78 years
young.
She's my grandmother, and she's the most important person in my life.
“Hey, Grams,” I say as I wrap my arms around her small frame the best
I can as she sits in her favorite chair in the rec center of the facility. As
usual, she has a word search book spread out in front of her. She's obsessed
with the damn things, going through a book a month on average.
She hugs me back. “Where you been, kid? I missed you for dinner last
night.”
A frown tugs at my lips. “I was in Vegas, remember?”
“Oh, yes. I remember now. You took that strapping young man with
you, right?”
I laugh because she can't remember that I was in Vegas, but she sure as
hell remembers Collin.
After fighting with her management for two weeks to get a new
bookshelf up in her room, I finally gave in and asked Collin if he could
come over and help put it together for her. He was more than happy to
oblige, and to say my grandmother fell in love with him would be an
understatement.
She recently became a hockey fan thanks to the other residents here
getting her into it during the Comets Cup run, and when star defenseman
Collin Wright walked through her door, she was over the moon…and
immediately started in on him about his stats.
He took it all in stride and promised to come back again another time
with Harper. They now stop by once a month to spend a few hours with my
grandmother, who Harper has always been close with too.
“How was the trip? You didn't get into too much trouble, did you?”
A pit forms at the bottom of my stomach at her words.
Too much trouble? Try all the trouble.
“Actually, Grams, that's what I'm here to talk to you about today.”
“Oh no, my little Beauty. I know that tone. What happened?”
I grin at her nickname for me.
When I was younger, I was obsessed with Beauty and the Beast. Mostly
because I really wanted the sweet library like Belle had, but still. We're
talking watching it every day, practically living in my replica Belle dress,
and talking to the dishes kind of obsessed.
Because of that, my grandmother began to call me Beauty.
Fitting now, especially since I'm married to The Beast.
Speaking of…
I take a steadying breath. “Well, there's this guy I've been seeing for a
while.” Not a complete lie. I have known Rhodes for a while. “Things…
well…they got very serious very fast. And we sort of…got married.”
She lifts a brow, eyeing me stoically. “Sort of?”
“Well, we did. W-We got…married. We're married.” The word keeps
tripping me up, and I pray she doesn't see through my facade.
She continues to stare at me, and finally, after what feels like twenty
excruciating minutes, a big smile breaks out across her face, and she claps
her hands together. “Oh, I am so happy for you, dear!” She gasps. “It's not
to that Steven fella, is it?”
“No. We broke up, remember?”
Her shoulders sag in relief. “Good. I never liked that little asshole.”
I bark out a laugh. My grandma might be old and petite and have to use
a walker to get around most days, but she's full of fire where it counts.
“Well, who is he? Tell me all about him.”
“Wait…you're happy?”
“Of course I'm happy. Whatever makes you happy makes me happy,
and you got that glow about you, so I have nothing to worry about.”
“But you don't think it was too sudden or anything?”
“Pfft!” She waves her hand at me. “When you know, you know, right,
dear?”
I can't help but think of Rhodes saying the same thing.
The romantic in me wants to agree, but this isn't romantic. There's
nothing romantic about any of this at all.
I should have known Grams would think otherwise though. After all,
she's the one who introduced me to romantic comedies and romance novels
and taught me the real meaning of love.
“Tell me everything about him. When do I get to meet this fine young
man who has swept my little Beauty off her feet?”
I hadn't really thought that far ahead. I guess Rhodes does need to meet
my grandmother. After all, he will be the one paying for her care for the
next year.
“Well, he has a pretty busy schedule, so I'll have to get with him and
find a time where he can come and get to know you some. I guess you kind
of technically already know him.”
Her gray brows furrow. “I do?”
I nod. “Well, he, uh, he works with Collin.”
Her green eyes—the same shade as mine—grow in size. “You've
married a hockey player?”
I nod again. “Yep. I…married a hockey player.”
“Ooh, girl.” She licks her lips. “You could bounce a quarter off their
asses.”
“Grams!”
She lifts her dainty shoulder. “What? Just because I'm old doesn't mean
I can't appreciate the nice things in life anymore.”
I shake my head, grinning.
She's not wrong about that. Hockey players do have some nice butts,
and Rhodes is no exception to this rule.
“Is that how you two met? Through Harper?”
“Yeah, I guess you could say that.” Ugh, we really need to get our story
straight. “We've been dancing around one another for months.” Not totally
untrue. Any time I've tried to befriend Rhodes, he's always walked away
from me. “You know how it can be on vacation. Sometimes those feelings
you keep bottled up can just come right out, and that's what happened. We
just looked at each other and knew.”
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit. All of it lies.
“Awww.” She places her hand over her heart. “That is just too sweet.
How did he propose?”
I don't remember it.
I was up half the night last night trying to remember any details of our
wedding beyond what was posted online. I remember the diner and him
forcing me to eat to sober me up some. I remember the look on his face
when he learned the woman he loves is marrying someone else. And I
remember him begging me to help him forget.
But after that, it's pretty blank.
“He put the ring in a glass of champagne.”
She frowns. “A little unoriginal, but show me the ring and we'll see if
he can redeem himself.”
The ring? Fuck!
“It's, uh, getting resized.”
Another lie. The ring fits fine. I just took it off this morning because I
couldn't stand the sight of it. I made the mistake of getting on my phone
and saw all the notifications I had. There were a few comments about how
it had to be fake, and I even saw an article saying the same thing.
Just looking at the ring knowing they were right made my stomach hurt,
so I took it off.
“Oh, well, that's too bad. Hopefully it'll be ready next time when you
come to visit.”
“I'm sure it will be. Speaking of visiting, I have some good news.”
She perks up at my announcement. “More good news?”
Oh, right. I forgot my marriage was supposed to be good news too.
“Yes.” I lean in closer. “Don't say anything just yet, but we're going to
be moving you out of here and into a new place soon.”
I'm not quite sure what I thought she'd do, maybe jump out of her chair,
do a little dance. I definitely wasn't expecting her lips to pull down in a
frown.
“Oh, Beauty, as much as I appreciate that, I know this place is already a
bit out of budget.”
I don't talk to my grandmother about how much this facility costs, but I
shouldn't be surprised that of course she knows.
“It's fine, Grams. My…husband wants to do this for you.”
“Does he really?”
I nod. “Yes. He knows you mean the world to me, and he wants to take
good care of you.”
Her shoulders sink with relief. “Oh, gosh. I am so happy to hear that.
You found yourself a good one. You make sure you keep him.”
If she only knew…
Grams steers the conversation toward all the drama happening around
the facility. Her roommate, Deana, had a friend over, and after a few too
many bottles of wine, a male stripper showed up at Grams' door and…well,
let's just say that friend is no longer permitted on the premises.
We chat for a while longer, and I tell her about Harper's good news she
shared with me this morning—she and Collin are moving in together.
Grams looks a little heartbroken that Collin won't be leaving Harper for her
anytime soon, but she tells me to pass on her congratulations anyway.
My phone buzzes in my pocket and I pull it out to check it.
Rhodes: I'm here.
Oh, shit. I completely forgot Rhodes was meeting me at my apartment to
help me move.
My landlord wasn't too happy with my last-minute move-out when I
called this morning, but I don't really care. It's not like he hasn't left me
high and dry plenty of times in the years I've lived there.
Rhodes: Where are you???
Me: Hold your horses. I'll be there in a bit.
Three dots appear on the screen. Bounce, bounce, bounce they go. Then
they disappear.
Appear, disappear.
Something tells me he is not pleased right now.
Me: I can feel you glaring at me through the phone.
Me: I'm with my grandmother. Time got away from me.
Rhodes: You're with your grandma? Don't you think I should
have come with you? Met her?
He's probably right. He should be here to meet her for many different
reasons.
But I wanted to tell Grams about Rhodes on my own. You know, just in
case the crazy old bat flew out of her chair and maimed him for marrying
her granddaughter on a whim in Vegas. Then I'd have to bail her out of jail,
and it would be a whole thing—one I don't have the time or patience to deal
with right now.
Rhodes: I mean, I AM going to be paying her bills.
Me: I mean, I AM helping you fake a marriage.
Rhodes: Point taken.
Rhodes: Just hurry up. I'm starving and want to get this shit
done.
“Now, dear, who has you frowning like that? I hope it's not your new man.”
I tuck my phone back into my pocket, turning my attention to a worriedlooking Grams. “It's nothing I can't handle.”
She chucks my chin. “Attagirl. Tough, just like I taught you.”
And she did. Harper always calls me Ryan the Lion, but she has no idea
that I'm a cute cub compared to Grams.
“Listen, Grams, I gotta jet.”
“Got some ass to whoop?” She sticks her little fists up, punching at a
pretend victim.
Man, I love this woman. She's tough on the outside, sweet on the inside.
“That's right.” I wink at her, then wrap her in another hug. “I'll be back
on Sunday for our usual dinner, okay?”
She crooks her finger at me, beckoning me closer. “Bring burgers. It's
meatloaf this weekend, and it tastes like cat turds.”
“You got it,” I whisper conspiratorially.
Every Sunday I stop by to have dinner with her and bring her something
different for dinner. I figure it's the least I can do since she's stuck in this
crummy place.
But not for much longer. Soon, she'll be out of here and on to
somewhere much better.
I just have to keep reminding myself that all this crap with Rhodes is
worth it because Grams will be happy.
That's all that matters.
My phone buzzes again.
Rhodes: A “Yes, husband” would be nice.
I grit my teeth, pocketing my phone.
I give Grams one last kiss, then head out.
For Grams, I remind myself as I leave to definitely not murder my
husband.

RHODES
Ryan: You are so annoying.
Ryan: I'm on my way. Happy now?
Me: Thrilled.
Me: Now stop texting and driving.
Ryan: Yes, husband. *eye roll emoji*
I laugh, tossing my phone into the passenger seat.
I lean back, resting my head against the headrest, and close my eyes
since apparently Ryan is going to be a while still.
For someone who travels a lot for work, you would think I'd have it
down pat, but it always seems to take a lot out of me. Add in having to talk
with my mom—that's an hour's worth of ass chewing—an early-morning
shift at the summer hockey camp the Comets run down at the rink, and then
a meeting with my general manager and coach, which was a whole other
level of exhausting, and I'm fucking beat.
That's not even including the debacle from this weekend and my lack of
sleep from dealing with everything.
I really hope getting Ryan settled in goes quickly. I need a nap pronto.
My ringtone chimes over the car speakers. I peek at the infotainment
screen and see it's Brittney calling. She's been doing this a lot lately. So
often in fact that my inbox is full of messages from her that I refuse to listen
to. I should probably delete them.
I ignore the call, and just as I close my eyes, my phone goes off again.
This time it's an incoming call from a number I don't recognize.
“No, thanks, spam caller.”
I press the end button and lean my head back again.
Not even ten seconds later, my phone rings again.
Okay, this is just annoying.
I hit the answer button without looking at the screen and let out a
growly, “What.”
“Well, I hope that's not how you answer the phone when your wife
calls.”
Shit.
“Sorry, my bad, Shep. What's up?”
“What's up? What's up? That's the best you've got for me?” He laughs
derisively. “You get married over the weekend and don't give your agent
any sort of heads-up about it, and then when he finally gets ahold of you,
your response is What's up?”
He has me there.
“Uh, my bad.”
“I think that's even worse.” He laughs. “So, are you going to tell me
what the hell happened?”
I sigh, scrubbing a hand over my face. “I don't even know where to
start.”
“Well, I'm going to go ahead and take a guess that this marriage wasn't
at all planned and there might have been a little bit of alcohol involved.”
Now it's my turn to laugh. “That obvious, huh?”
“Nah. I've just been there before. I got married in Vegas myself. We had
Elvis do our vows.”
“You were married before Denver?”
“Nope. That's who I married. Granted, we were already in a committed
relationship, which I'm guessing is a lot more than I can say for you.”
I'm mildly annoyed by how well he knows me, but I guess that's to be
expected when you've been working with the same person for as many
years as I've been with Shep.
Shepard Clark, former pro baseball star and World Series champion, has
been my agent since I finally made it to the big leagues. Collin signed with
him first, and after hearing his raving recommendation, I decided to give
him a shot too. And boy, am I glad I did. I don't think there are many agents
out there who wouldn't be blowing up their players' phones if they got
married without telling them. But Shep has only dropped me a single text
asking me to call when I'm ready. He's more the type of guy to sit back and
let us come to him if we need him. That might not be a good style for a lot
of players, but I like his approach. I like that I can still be a grown-ass adult
and not feel like I have a babysitter but also know I have somebody there
who has my back when I need it.
“I had no idea you and Denver got married in Vegas.”
“Yeah, it was kind of a last-minute thing. She was pregnant, but she lost
the baby shortly after. I mean, not that I married her because she was
pregnant. I was head over heels in love with the woman, but…I'm
rambling. You know what I mean though.”
I don't know. I don't know what he means because Ryan and I were not
in love.
We were just drunk.
“You would be correct to assume there was a lot of alcohol involved,” I
tell him.
“This have anything to do with your ex getting engaged to that dickhead
former teammate of yours?”
“It…was a factor. Definitely led me to drinking. Not sure what led me
to the altar though. Not really my finest moment.”
“No, I'd say not. So, this wife of yours—that's Harper's friend Ryan,
yeah?”
“Yeah, that's her. Do you know her?”
“Sort of. Denver is friends with her. We have a couple of her
photographs hanging up around our house. She's talented as hell.”
Agreed.
“Anyway,” Shep says, “I guess the real reason I'm calling is…do I need
to be worried about this last-minute marriage?”
What he's really asking is: Is this going to fuck up my season?
“No. We have it under control.”
“Do I even want to know the details?”
“Probably not. But it's fine. I promise.”
“Okay. Comets know it's all a sham?”
I chuckle. Leave it to Shep to call it what it is. He's a straight shooter,
and that's what I like about him.
Do the Comets know it's a sham? No.
I told them I've been seeing Ryan for a while now and things were
getting serious, so we decided to elope, and they took it at face value. I
think a lot of that has to do with the fact that I'm not known as a guy who
makes rash decisions. I'm the thinker. The levelheaded one. The guy who
makes calculated choices. I'm fairly sure that played into them believing
this wasn't just some spur-of-the-moment thing.
Did I still get my ass reamed for making headlines? Fuck yes.
But I think if I keep my nose down this upcoming season, it'll all blow
over. The new public relations rep who joined the organization last summer
agreed with me on that too.
Truthfully, they were more concerned about how Brittney being
engaged to Colter is going to affect my performance on the ice when we
play Florida.
I told them it wouldn't, and I plan to keep that promise.
Colter isn't worth my time, and neither is Brittney. What's done is done.
I have bigger fish to fry, like convincing the world I'm in love with my
wife.
“What sham? This is real. I am super in love.”
He laughs again. “From a PR standpoint, good answer. As a friend…
good luck with that?” I hear a commotion on the other end of the line, and a
kid starts to cry in the background. “Oh, fuck. I gotta go, man. Do yourself
a favor—never have children.”
Every time I talk to him, he feeds me the same line, but I know he loves
his kids.
“Listen,” he says, “if you need anything, just call. If there's a shitstorm,
we'll work through it. Just maybe give me a heads-up next time, yeah?”
“I can do that. And, Shep? Thanks for being so chill about this.”
“Man, if you only knew half the stupid shit I did in my day…” He huffs
out a laugh. “We all make mistakes. It's just how we choose to deal with
them that matters. But know if shit hits the fan with this one, I am married
to a journalist, and we'll help spin the story however you'd like, okay?”
“Appreciate it.”
There's another loud commotion. “Fucking hell. Duty calls, man. Talk
later.”
“Later.”
The call disconnects just as Ryan rounds the corner.
It's midafternoon and the sun is hanging high in the sky right behind
her. From this angle, it almost looks like she's wearing a halo.
But I know the truth. That's no halo—those are horns.
She's full of too much sass for it to be a halo.
I hop out of the car and meet her just as she begins walking up the steps
to her apartment. She doesn't greet me; she just gives me side-eye.
I smirk at her. “Hi, wife.”
“Husband,” she retorts with disdain, narrowing her eyes at me. “Ready
to get packing?”
“Packing? You haven't packed yet?”
“Nope,” she says, popping the P as she pushes her key into the lock.
“I've been busy.”
“Busy? Doing what?”
“Washing my hair.” She tosses the quip over her shoulder as we begin
climbing the stairs.
I'm not dumb. I know that's the go-to girl answer when they don't want
to do something.
I pinch a lock of blonde hair between my fingertips. “If that's the case,
you didn't do a very good job. It's looking a bit dull.”
She gasps, whirling around to smack at me. “You ass!”
“Right back at you, babe. You should have thought about that before
you decided to skip out on packing your shit up so we could make this
move a lot faster.”
“Excuse me if I'm not very excited to pack up my entire life and move
in with you.” She turns back around, stomping up the stairs double time.
The only problem is I have almost a foot on her and keep up with her
with zero issues.
She doesn't like this either.
By the time we reach her door, she's pissed and literally shuts it in my
face, leaving me out in the hall.
I sigh, hanging my head, cursing drunk me for what feels like the
millionth time for getting into this mess.
I push open her door and am instantly greeted by an adorable black
fluffball darting out into the hallway.
“Poe!”
Ryan takes off after her, brushing past me with a glare. She catches the
cat just before she darts down the stairs. She walks back to the apartment,
snuggling her up to her chest. As she passes me, I hear her whisper into the
cat's ear about what a little brat she is.
“Gotta be careful with the doors. She loves to run out of them,” Ryan
says, setting the cat down only once I've closed the door.
The cat eyes me from across the room, and I notice that her eyes are the
same shade as her owner's. She takes small, tentative steps toward me, and
I crouch down to meet her on her level, holding my hand out so she can get
a sniff.
The tip of her nose is chilly as she brushes against my fingers a few
times. She must decide I'm pretty okay, because the next thing I know, she's
dropping her weight in the palm of my hand.
“Yeah, she does that. It means she wants you to hold her,” Ryan says
from the kitchen where she's pulling things from the cabinets. And by from
the kitchen, I mean directly to my right, because really, this whole place is
one big room.
And it's a tiny room at that. I think my garage is bigger than the whole
apartment…and I don't have that big of a garage.
I look around the open area. Ryan wasn't kidding when she said there
wasn't much she has to take with her. The place is sparsely decorated, and
there's no big furniture. I'm trying hard not to concentrate on the cheap
mattresses stacked on top of one another in the corner.
No wonder she wants a new bed.
There's a small vanity set up in the corner and a ring light beside it.
“Is that where you make your videos?”
“Yep.”
She doesn't elaborate, but something in her quick response has me
asking…
“Do you like it?”
She pauses in her packing, looking at me. “Huh?”
“Doing the influencer thing…do you like it?”
Her nose scrunches up, and it's kind of cute. “I hate that word.
Influencer. It sounds so…superficial.” I agree. “But, yeah, it's fun.”
“Would you rather be doing something else though?”
She considers the question a moment. “Yes and no. I love the creativity
of it, but I hate the social media aspect of it. Photography is another big
passion of mine, and I'd honestly like to do more with that other than take
selfies of my makeup.”
“You do some drop-in exhibits downtown, yeah?”
She seems surprised I know. “Uh, yeah. Sometimes. I like doing
interactive ones, and they usually seem to be a hit.”
“The one you did with Harper and Collin…that was kind of rough. I
saw some of those photographs. They were very…raw.”
“What can I say? I like it rough and raw.” Her eyes widen when she
realizes how that sounds. “Emotionally. I meant emotionally. As in I like to
capture the raw human emotion.”
I hold back my laugh. “Noted.”
“Anyway, enough about me.” She waves her hand. “Did you talk to
your boss people?”
“My boss people?” I grin. “Yeah, I spoke with the GM and my
coaches.”
“And? What'd you tell them?”
“The truth.” Her mouth slackens. “That you're madly in love with me
and you couldn't wait to marry me, so you got me drunk and made me do it
in Vegas.”
She rolls her eyes. “Sounds wildly accurate. I'm sure they bought it.”
“Actually, they did.”
“Really?”
I nod. “Yep. They wrote up a quick press release just to get the media
who is questioning it off our backs. It'll go out tonight.”
I fucking loathe the media. It's my least favorite thing about playing
hockey. I avoid headlines at all costs and rarely do any after-game press.
Sometimes I'll have a quick chat with our home announcer, but that's it.
I'm not standing around while a bunch of people shove cameras and mics in
my face.
“Wow. That is…wow.” She shakes her head. “So, uh, I guess this is all
real, then, huh?”
“Afraid so.” The cat snuggles into me, wanting my attention, so I
scratch her ears. She purrs against me. “You said her name is Poe?”
“Yep.”
“Like Edgar Allan Poe?”
“No, like Poe Dameron. Because she's a badass just like him.”
I grin. Ryan has a nerd side. Huh. Who knew?
“She's sweet.” I continue scratching between her ears, and she pushes
her head into my hand.
Ryan snorts. “She likes to pretend she's sweet. Really, she's just a
spoiled brat who is a total bitch if she doesn't get her way.”
“How old is she?”
“About six months. I actually adopted her from that animal shelter
Harper and Collin are always volunteering at.”
“Really? That's where I got my dog too.”
“Those damn do-gooders rubbing off on us. I swore I'd never get a pet,
but one look at Poe and I was a goner. She had me wrapped around her
finger like you are now. Until—”
“Ow! Motherfucker!” Poe sinks her teeth into my finger, and I swear
she grins up at me around it.
“That. Until that.”
I pull my finger from Poe's mouth, and she jumps from my arms,
strutting away like she hasn't a care in the world.
Ryan pads into the living room and grabs my finger, inspecting it.
“I'm sorry. She's difficult sometimes. I think she's just still adjusting
to…well, being alive. She's like a toddler. Totally unpredictable,” she
explains, tugging me back into the kitchen.
I let her lead me to a tiny, café-style table. She shoves me down in the
chair, then spins around and reaches over the top of the fridge, standing on
her tiptoes to get to the cabinet above it. She struggles a moment to reach
whatever she's looking for but then spins back around with the first aid kit
in hand.
I want to laugh at her because a kitten bite is nothing compared to the
injuries I'm used to. I get hit by two-hundred-plus-pound adults skating
over 15 MPH and take slapshots from pucks soaring six times that. This
isn't shit compared to that.
But she seems determined to care for me, so…I let her.
And I don't know why I let her.
I think it's because of the way she traps the tip of her tongue between
her teeth as she concentrates on squeezing just a miniscule amount of
antibiotic ointment out of the tube and rubbing it gently on the two puncture
wounds. The way a little crinkle of skin forms between her eyebrows as she
opens the bandage and peels back the protective layers. The way all of her
attention is focused on getting the Band-Aid to sit just right on my finger.
There's no denying that Ryan is an attractive woman. Her hair is that
peculiar shade of blonde that has all kinds of tones mixed in when you look
close enough. Her eyes are the most unique shade I've ever seen, a deep
dark forest hue around the outer edges that lightens up around the iris. Her
nose is just on this side of too small for her face, but the way it turns up at
the end is too fucking cute. And there's a little beauty mark just under her
right eye.
She looks like a more natural, modern-day, green-eyed Marilyn Monroe
—beautiful with that edge to her that makes you just slightly tremble in her
presence, but in the best way possible.
“I can feel you staring at me,” she says quietly as she tucks the supplies
back in the kit.
It's on the tip of my tongue to apologize, but why should I apologize?
She's my wife; I can stare at her if I want.
She picks up the first aid kit to put it back in the cabinet above the
refrigerator. Just like she struggled to get it down, she battles to toss it back
up there. Her lean body stretches out long as she presses up on the tips of
her toes once again. Her ass pushes out toward me, and my god is it a
beautiful ass.
Before I know it, I've risen from the table and I'm standing behind her.
Her breath hitches when I press against her, and she halts all movement.
I don't know what I'm doing, but I can't not be next to her right now.
I place my hands on her hips, unable to stop myself from touching her.
She takes another stuttered breath, and I swear I can feel her heart beating.
My fingers dig into her waist as I breathe her in. She smells so good
standing this close, like sunshine and fresh lemons and just a hint of
something else. It's the same way she smelled at the club when we were
dancing, and it's making me feel the same way it did then too.
She swallows thickly, and I can feel her trembling beneath my touch as
I slip my fingers under the hem of her shirt. Her skin is soft, and I bet it
tastes as good as it smells.
I lean forward, brushing my lips against the exposed skin on her neck. I
brush my lips back and forth and back again, pressing soft kisses
everywhere I can.
This is exactly what I pictured this morning as I palmed my cock in the
shower—her body beneath my lips.
She makes a low sound in her throat, and it's enough to pull me from
whatever daze I'm in.
What the fuck are you doing, Rhodes? Quit touching her. She's not
really yours to touch.
With reluctance, I step away from her, putting distance between us once
again, and I hear her exhale a shaky breath.
“We should pack that,” I say, hoping she doesn't notice how scratchy
my voice is right now or call me out on what just happened.
“Right. Packing.” She clears her throat and sets the first aid kit on the
counter beside her. She runs a hand through her hair, then turns to me.
I wait for it. Wait for her to yell at me for putting my hands on her. For
kissing her.
But she doesn't.
All she says is, “Ready to get started?”

RYAN
Just like that, my whole life is turned upside down.
Okay, fine. My life was turned upside down several days ago, but
moving out of the first apartment I've ever had is definitely a big deal.
I glance around my new bedroom and am shocked by the amount of
space I have in here. My old apartment was one giant room, and by giant, I
mean very tiny. This new bedroom is half the size of what my whole
apartment was.
I think people are under the impression that I have this glamorous life
because people follow me on social media, but that's not the case at all. I'm
struggling just like everybody else.
The fact that the entirety of my possessions can fit into the back of just
one SUV proves that.
Even though I didn't have a lot to move, I am still somehow exhausted
when we carry in the last box. I think it's all the drama of the last few days
finally catching up to me.
“Hey.”
Rhodes startles me, appearing in my bedroom door out of nowhere with
his adorable one-year-old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Frodo, in his
arms.
“Sorry,” he mutters.
“It's fine.”
We didn't talk much as we packed my apartment. You could even say
we went as far as to completely ignore one another, which was a difficult
feat in such a tiny space. But it was awkward after he did…well, whatever
you want to call what he did.
I try to shake off how he felt pressed against me. Big and warm and just
right.
And I really don't want to think about the way his lips felt ghosting
against my neck.
“I'm starving,” he says, interrupting my thoughts before I do something
really dumb like moan. “Do you want to order something for dinner?”
My stomach rumbles at the mention of food, but my first reaction is to
say no, I can't afford it.
Before I can get the words out, Rhodes says, “My treat.”
I am not about to argue with that.
“Sure, what did you have in mind?”
“Doesn't matter to me. I'm not picky. Whatever you'll eat, I'm fine
with.”
“Hmm, too much against your diet if I wanted to order stuffed crust
meat lover's pizza?”
“I think I can survive one stuffed crust pizza, but only if we can add
extra green peppers.”
“And breadsticks. Maybe wings too?”
“Fuck it, why don't we throw in dessert too?”
“Really?”
“No. Just pizza. I'll order it and take Frodo out for a walk while you
finish settling in. There's a really good place that delivers here.”
“I'll let Poe out for a bit to explore while you're gone, if that's okay?”
“Sounds good,” he says, but he doesn't make a move to leave.
“Yes?” I ask.
He runs a hand over his jaw. “I noticed you aren't wearing your ring.”
Oh.
“I, uh, I took it off for moving,” I lie, my heart racing in my chest.
He tilts his head, his hazel eyes boring into me. If he knows I'm lying,
he doesn't say anything.
Instead, he nods again. “Okay. But, Ryan?”
“Yes?”
“I'd like you to wear it.”
The way he says it…I don't know. It's almost like he's hurt that I don't
have it on, and I didn't expect him to care, honestly.
“Okay. I'll wear it,” I promise. And I mean it. I'll slip it back on tonight.
“Okay.”
This time he does walk away, leaving me to finish unpacking.
I give myself a shake, pushing away the ring conversation because I do
not have the brain power to overthink it right now, and start on unboxing all
of my clothes. I felt very smart when I decided to leave them all on the
hangers, making this part super easy.
It's not that I ever lived a lavish lifestyle before, but after my
grandmother took a fall and needed to go into the facility, I really started to
take a look at my budget. One thing I realized was that I spent entirely too
much money on clothes I didn't wear. So, I sold a bunch of pieces online to
make some cash, then went shopping for a capsule wardrobe. Now I just
rotate the same thirty or so pieces. Seeing everything lined up in this
massive closet makes me want to laugh, and maybe cry a little because it's
becoming increasingly clear that I do not belong here.
I'm just Ryan Bell, the girl whose parents abandoned their children to
travel the country in an RV. The girl who was raised by her grandparents,
went to public school, and had to take out so much money in student loans
to get a BFA she doesn't even use.
I love that my grandparents were so encouraging and always pushed us
to follow our dreams, to get a degree in something that interested us,
something we were passionate about.
But when my grandfather passed away unexpectedly and shit hit the fan
financially for them and then my grandmother had her fall, I quickly
realized I made a huge mistake. I didn't need a degree in something that
excited me. I needed a degree in something practical. And now I'm paying
the price, married to a guy I don't even love just to pay my bills.
What a fucking life.
I continue unpacking my room until Rhodes calls out to tell me the
pizza is here.
“Finally. I am starving,” I say as I make my way into the kitchen, which
is also massive.
He gave me a quick tour earlier, but I really didn't pay much attention to
just how wide and open everything is. It's totally blowing my mind.
Rhodes grabs two plates from the cabinet next to the giant stainless steel
fridge, and I make a mental note that that's where the dishes are kept. He
sets them on the counter as I slide onto the barstool tucked under the ledge.
“Drink?” he asks, heading for the fridge.
“Water is fine.”
It's not fine. I actually hate water, but I don't want to be a burden right
now.
When I feel him staring at me, I look up. “What?”
“Do you really want water or do you want something else?”
“Actually, if you have some milk, that would be nice.”
He wrinkles his nose. “Milk?”
I shrug. “What? It's good with pizza.”
“Whatever you say.”
He reaches into the fridge and pulls out a fancy glass carafe full of milk.
Who actually puts milk in a glass carafe? Why is he not drinking it straight
from the carton like a normal person?
He grabs a cup from the cabinet next to the plates, pours me a generous
glass, then slides it my way. He leaves the carafe on the counter just in case
I want more.
I notice there's more than one box sitting on the counter.
He lied.
He totally got breadsticks and dessert.
He pulls open the lid of the pizza box and nods toward dinner. “Dig in.”
And we do.
I'm halfway through my third slice and second breadstick when I just
can't take any more. I toss the half-uneaten pizza onto the plate and lean
back on my stool, resting my hand on my stomach.
“Ugh. I can't. I can't do any more.”
“Wuss.” Rhodes snatches my pizza off my plate and shoves the rest of it
into his mouth in one bite.
I'm a little impressed, but I don't say that. “Didn't your mom teach you
any manners?”
“Yes. So don't tell her I did that when you meet her.”
I think about that…the fact that I'm going to have to meet Rhodes'
parents and pretend to be married to him in front of them.
“What are they like?”
“My parents?” I nod. “I don't know…parents.”
“Yeah, but what's that like? Not all of us had parents.”
A frown tugs at his lips, and I don't like the sympathy I see in his eyes.
Thankfully, he doesn't ask any questions and moves on.
“Their names are Margaret and Oscar, but my mom goes by Maggie.
They've been married for thirty years, and they are the epitome of a perfect
marriage.”
I raise my brow. “A perfect marriage? Those don't exist.”
Not even my grandparents had a perfect marriage, but that's what I
loved about them. They had dark spots, but they always worked through
them. To me, that's the real definition of a solid relationship. Not one that
doesn't have its problems—just one that doesn't let the problems win.
That's what I want.
“As close to perfect as you can get, trust me.”
“When are your parents coming to visit next?”
“They'll be here for my first home game. It's tradition. So, we'll have
some time to practice being married before then.”
Practice being married.
I like how he just glazes right over that like it's not a completely
fucked-up phrase to use.
“What about your brother? Is he coming to visit soon?”
“Ha. I wish. But no. He was really close with my grandfather and he
passed… Well, he hasn't really been back to the States that often. He's
definitely that guy who is married to his career.”
“I can understand that. I've been married to hockey since I was a teen.
But he should be helping you, you know.”
I don't disagree with him because he's right. My brother should be
helping me, and I'm sure he would if he actually knew how hard things
have become. But I don't want to burden him with it. Besides, it's not like I
was on the verge of being homeless or anything. I (mostly) had it managed
even without the help from Rhodes. Now I can just breathe a little easier.
Well, as good as one can breathe being married to someone they don't
love.
Rhodes clears his throat and sits back, tossing his balled-up napkin onto
his plate.
“So, I take it you're too full for dessert, then?”
I perk up. “Dessert?”
“Yeah, it looks like some brownies made it into my cart when I was
checking out.”
Made it into his cart, huh? He totally bought me dessert, and for some
reason, that really warms my heart.
“I wonder how that happened.”
“No clue, but since they're here, we might as well eat them, right?”
“Brownies sound so good, but I'm seriously full right now. Rain
check?”
“Rain check it is.”
“All I want at the moment is a shower and to sleep for like eight to nine
hours.” I gasp. “Oh, shit! A bed! I don't have a bed to sleep in.”
“Ah, fuck. In my dire state of hunger, I kind of forgot we needed to go
shopping. I'm sure everywhere is closed by now.”
“Where the hell am I going to sleep tonight?”
“You can sleep in my bed.”
I balk at his suggestion. “I'm not sleeping with you, Rhodes. I thought
we covered this.”
“I'm going to pretend I didn't just hear the utter disgust in your voice,
and I was not referring to sleeping with me. I just said you could sleep in
my bed.”
“Where will you sleep?”
“I'll take the couch.” He shrugs. “I don't know if you've sat on that
thing yet, but it's comfortable as fuck. I take all my pre-home-game naps
there.”
An image of Rhodes snuggled on the couch before a game races across
my mind. What I'm not expecting is for the image to transform and for me
to be wrapped in his arms.
I shake the thought away. “I don't want to put you out.”
Rhodes puts his hand to his chest. “Did you just display an emotion
other than complete displeasure for me?”
I barely resist the urge to roll my eyes. “Yeah, but don't get used to it.”
“Ah, there she is.” He shakes his head. “You can take my bed tonight,
and tomorrow after I get done with practice, we can go furniture shopping.
Apparently, I owe you a new bedroom set.”
“You have practice tomorrow?”
“I don't have practice tomorrow, but I have to help with practice.”
I tilt my head, not understanding.
“I volunteer during the summer to help out the Comets junior league.”
He volunteers? And with children? That…surprises me. He's always
so…well, Rhodes. Grumpy and always looking half annoyed. I'm surprised
he works with children.
“Before you start getting ideas like me being nice, just know it's
practically mandatory.”
“And here I thought you might have a heart in there somewhere under
all those cantankerous scowls.”
“Cantankerous? Oh. Nice eighteen-point word.”
“You Scrabble?”
“I dabble.”
This time I do roll my eyes at him, pushing away from the counter.
“And on that note, I'm done for the night.”
I hop down from my stool and gather my plate, deposit it into the
dishwasher. I clean up our mess, condense the number of boxes down, and
put them in the fridge along with the milk Rhodes left out for me.
That tension that seems to permanently exist between us slowly fills the
air. It's like this every time we're in the same room for more than a few
minutes.
It's suffocating, and I need an escape.
“Do you mind if I take a shower?”
“Not at all. This is your house too. You don't have to ask to shower.”
I…I hadn't thought of that. This is my home, isn't it? At least for the
next year.
“Thanks,” I murmur, making my way back down the hall to my
bedroom.
I gather up my shower items and pajamas—I really don't need to be
caught by Rhodes in nothing but a towel—and then head into the guest
bathroom.
I'm not at all surprised to find that even the bathroom is gigantic.
There's a huge tub to one side and a walk-in shower…in the guest
bathroom.
The tub calls my name because I love a good bath, but I think a shower
is what I need tonight. I'll test the bath out later.
For a brief moment, I wonder how much money Rhodes actually makes.
Apparently, it's enough to afford a place like this, spend random weekends
in Vegas in swanky hotel suites, and drop thousands of dollars a month on
my grandmother's care.
I strip out of my clothes, feeling all gross and sticky from moving, and
step into the shower.
I crank the water up to full blast, and I'm not even a little bit ashamed of
the moan that leaves me.
I linger in the shower, soaking up the hot water. The pressure in my old
place was decent, but the water was never hot enough for me. This? It's
heaven, and I can see myself getting way too used to it too fast. I lather my
sponge up and close my eyes, rubbing it over my body. It feels incredible as
I drag it across my breasts and down my stomach, rough but not too rough.
If I concentrate really hard, it feels like someone else's hand.
Rhodes' face pops into my head and my eyes fly open.
No. Nope. Not happening.
I barely even finish rinsing before shutting the water off because I am
not going there. If I'm going to survive living with him, I can't let that
happen.
I wrap the softest towel I've ever felt around me and step out of the
shower. I take my time rubbing lotion all over my body, then do my nightly
skincare routine, trying to let my mind relax so I'm not going to bed
thinking about how Rhodes is going to be sleeping just down the hall from
me.
Feeling like a brand-new woman, I step out of the bathroom and head
into my room.
Poe is skulking around it, and I do my best not to let her out as I slip
inside to drop my stuff off. She and Frodo haven't been introduced yet, so
I'm trying to keep her in here for now just in case it doesn't go over well.
I dump my dirty clothes into a hamper, then grab my laptop. I'm tired,
but just in case I can't sleep in a new house, I'll have my computer so I can
edit the makeup tutorial I filmed before heading to Vegas.
Ugh. I don't even want to think about how explosive the comments are
going to be after this. I mean, on one hand, it's great for algorithms, but on
another…I really hate lying to my subscribers.
I pull open the door and look back at Poe.
She meows, and I instantly feel bad for leaving her in here. She did such
a good job on the car ride over and has been stuck in this room all evening.
I'm sure Rhodes won't mind if she sleeps with me, right?
Unable to stop myself, I scoop her up. Just as I'm about to step out of
the room, I see my wedding ring lying next to a pile of my things.
Trying not to think too much about it, I slip it on and out the door, then
down the hall to Rhodes' bedroom. There's a lump on the couch. All the
lights are off, so I assume he's already gone to sleep. I mutter a quick
“Good night” as I pass by.
In typical Rhodes fashion, he doesn't respond.
I walk into his bedroom and look around. The room is massive, bigger
than my own. The first thing you notice when you walk in is the wall of
windows that look out down the hill. There's a perfect line where the sky
meets land, and it's gorgeous, almost like a painting.
To one side of the room, there's a bed that's easily four of my old beds
put together. To the other, there's a fireplace with two cozy-looking chairs
facing it.
And tucked away in the corner is a door that sits ajar, a soft light
pouring out of it.
That must be the bathroom.
I note that Rhodes has put a fresh pillow and case at the end of the bed,
and based on the pile of blankets on the chair, it looks like he's put on clean
sheets too.
I'm grateful. The last thing I need is to be smelling him all night long.
Poe hops out of my arms to explore, and I set the laptop on the bed, then
go to flip the bathroom light off.
Only when I'm just a few feet away do I hear the faint sound of running
water.
Oh shit.
Rhodes is in there.
I'm about to retreat and give him his privacy when I catch a glimpse of
his very naked backside.
I should pull the door shut and walk away. Cover my eyes. Announce
my presence. Literally anything other than standing here and admiring him.
But that's exactly what I do.
He's facing the wall, his head tipped forward as the water cascades over
him.
I thought his body was incredible the first time I saw him naked, but
seeing him like this is…it's breathtaking.
Like actually breathtaking because the air whooshes right from my
lungs.
His back is nothing but muscles, and I get now why they call him The
Beast.
He's jacked. Completely and totally jacked. I have no clue how he flies
down the ice like he does with all those muscles, but it makes it ten times
more impressive.
He pushes off the wall, reaching for a bottle of body wash and his loofa.
He suds himself up from head to toe and then…
Holy fuck.
There is no mistaking what he's doing right now.
He palms his cock, and he hisses loudly enough that I hear it over the
sound of the water crashing against the floor.
Then he begins to jack himself. Slowly. Very, very slowly.
So slowly there is no way it's not killing him right now.
An ache forms between my legs and I rub them together, trying to ease
it. But no matter how much I rub, it doesn't work.
I need more.
Without thinking too much about it, I slip my hand into my sleep shorts
and into my underwear. When my finger grazes over my clit, I realize I'm
wet just from watching him touch himself.
I had no idea voyeurism was something I was into, but there is no doubt
in my mind I could watch this all day long.
I match his long, slow strokes with short, slow circles over my sensitive
nub.
When he picks up his pace, I do too.
I sink my teeth into my bottom lip, trying to hold back the noises that
are trying to crawl their way from my throat, and when that doesn't work, I
slap my hand over my mouth and let them go.
Then, the worst thing possible happens: Rhodes turns around.
I freeze, halting all ministrations.
But he doesn't see me. His eyes are squeezed tightly shut as he leans
back against the wall just out from under the water.
No. This is so wrong. I can't do this. I can't stand here watching him
bring himself to orgasm while I do the same…right?
But when he begins to jack himself harder, faster, I do the same, rubbing
at my clit like I'm about to burst.
He bites down on his lip, his movements growing hastier by the second,
and I know he's close. He reaches down with his other hand and gently tugs
on his balls.
There is absolutely no mistaking what I hear next.
“Ryan.”
It's as clear as if he were standing next to me…and I come apart.
I watch as ropes of cum coat his stomach and his strokes become softer
and shorter as his breaths come in sharp succession.
The pounding in my own ears begins to subside as he leans back against
the tiled wall, looking spent.
Eyes still closed, he steps back under the water, and I slip away before
I'm caught.
I rush out of the room and down the hall to clean off my hand and then
tiptoe back into his bedroom and slip beneath the covers, setting my laptop
on my lap just as he's pulling open the bathroom door in nothing but a
towel.
I avert my eyes to the screen in front of me.
He doesn't seem surprised to see me, and that makes my heart pound all
over again.
He scrubs one towel over his head, then walks into the closet without a
word. He comes back out wearing a pair of black sweats, tosses his wet
towels into the bathroom, and flips the light off.
It's on the tip of my tongue to yell at him for leaving his towel strewn
about, but it's not my place.
“Got everything you need?” he asks.
I don't look up from the screen. I can't. I can feel how hot my cheeks
are, and there's no way he won't notice the post-orgasm flush I have going
on.
“Mhmm,” I say as Poe jumps up into the bed beside me, curling into my
side.
“All right, then. I'll be out on the couch.”
“'Kay.”
He hesitates a moment, but when I don't acknowledge, he gives up and
heads for the door.
Just as I think he's about to leave without saying anything, he turns back
to me and says, “Try not to stay up too late petting your pussy. I'm sure
she's tired. It's been quite the day for her. Good night, wife.”
And I just know he's not referring to Poe.

RYAN & RHODES
Rhodes: I ordered Chinese.
Ryan: Good for you.
Rhodes: It's here.
Ryan: Cool.
Rhodes: There's enough for two.
Ryan: No, thank you.
Rhodes: Sorry. I don't think I was clear.
Rhodes: Dinner is here, and you need to come eat.
Ryan: I'm not hungry.
Rhodes: Well, that's too damn bad.
Rhodes: Come eat.
Ryan: No.
Rhodes: Ryan…
Ryan: I'm so glad you know my name.
Rhodes: This is childish. Come eat.
Ryan: No.
Rhodes: Yes.
Rhodes: I can literally hear your stomach growling right now.
Ryan: Are you standing outside my door?
Rhodes: Yes. Now turn the porn off and come eat.
Ryan: It's not porn.
Rhodes: I am 95% sure I heard moaning.
Rhodes: Unless that was you, then it's totally porn.
Ryan: It's not porn, you ass!
Rhodes: So it's you?
Ryan: OMG NO!
Ryan: If I agree to come eat, will you leave me alone?
Rhodes: Yes.
Ryan: Fine. I'll be out in a minute.
Rhodes: So you can finish?
Ryan: I seriously hate you.
Rhodes: You only wish you did.
Rhodes: Your sex toy is here.
Ryan: Sex toy?!?
Rhodes: Yeah. Looks like some sort of butt stuff thing.
Ryan: HAHA
Ryan: Very funny, but that's not my thing.
Rhodes: Duly noted.
Ryan: Besides, whatever it is, it's not mine. I haven't ordered
anything since I moved in here.
Rhodes: But you do order sex toys? You just haven't while
you've lived here?
Ryan: Of course I order sex toys!
Ryan: But I didn't and that's not mine.
Rhodes: I am looking right at it and it is 100% a sex toy.
Rhodes: I'll send you a pic.
Ryan: I AM IN THE MIDDLE OF A STORE. DO NOT SEND
ME A PICTURE OF A SEX TOY.
Rhodes: *picture*
Rhodes: See? Definitely for your butt or something. There are
a ton of attachments.
Ryan: RHODES!
Ryan: That is NOT a sex toy. It's a curling wang, you moron.
Ryan: WAND. Curling WAND.
Rhodes: Sure. Right. Definitely not a “wang” or anything.
Ryan: Just leave it where it is, and I'll grab it when I get home.
Ryan: Now, can I please finish my shopping in peace?
Rhodes: Yes.
Rhodes: But don't forget to add lube to your list. Looks like
you're going to need it.
Ryan: DAMMIT RHODES!
Ryan: Fun fact: Closing the fridge generally helps it stay cold.
Rhodes: Very interesting. I had no idea.
Ryan: Oh, I know you didn't.
Ryan: In case you're not understanding my sarcasm, you left
the fridge open when you left this morning. Everything is
warm.
Rhodes: Shouldn't it beep to alert you it's open?? Couldn't
you have closed it??
Ryan: Couldn't YOU have closed it?? My milk is all warm and
gross.
Rhodes: That's what you get for drinking milk all willy-nilly like
some weirdo.
Ryan: It's not willy-nilly. I only drink it when I have pizza or
have a lot of chocolate.
Ryan: And don't say willy-nilly. It's weird.
Rhodes: Speaking of a lot of chocolate… Your period
chocolates are overflowing the snack cabinet.
Ryan: Those aren't period chocolates. Those are just what I
use to cope with the fact that I'm married to you.
Rhodes: Ouch.
Ryan: Are you going to be home soon?
Rhodes: Missing me already?
Ryan: Not even close.
Rhodes: So planning my murder?
Ryan: Guess you'll never know.
Ryan: I was asking because I was going to make dinner.
Rhodes: You can cook?
Ryan: Never mind.
Rhodes: I'm kidding! What are you making?
Ryan: Parmesan chicken and garlic bread.
Rhodes: Okay, wow. No need to start talking dirty.
Ryan: I take it that sounds good?
Rhodes: Yes, please.
Ryan: Now who's talking dirty?
Rhodes: Well played.
Rhodes: *picture*
Ryan: I didn't realize we were in the stage of our relationship
where we're sending sexy pictures to each other.
Rhodes: Did you just call me sexy?
Ryan: I meant the fact that you're actually following directions
and closing the fridge.
Rhodes: Nope. Sorry. I definitely heard that you think I'm
sexy.
Ryan: I definitely didn't say that.
Rhodes: Sure. Whatever you need to tell yourself.
Rhodes: I'm heading to the rink, but I'll be home before lunch.
You know, in case you need to take care of yourself because
you just can't resist my sexiness.
Ryan: It's not too soon for a divorce, right?
Rhodes: Sorry. You're stuck with me for a whole year. Deal's a
deal.
Ryan: Ugh. Don't remind me.

RHODES
She watched.
No—she more than watched.
She participated.
I don't know what alerted me to Ryan standing in the bathroom door,
but I could just feel her presence. It was like I had conjured her up.
My cock stirred to life when I felt her eyes raking over my body, and I
couldn't stop myself from reaching for my dick. I was already aching from
the moment we shared in her apartment. There was no way I could stand
there and not do anything.
When I heard the soft moans slip through the doorway, I knew she was
touching herself too. It took everything I had to keep my eyes closed and
not look at her.
I know she heard me say her name. I wanted her to hear me say her
name. And man, was it worth it.
It's been two weeks and we haven't had a repeat yet. Probably because
we went furniture shopping the next day and Ryan has practically been
holed up in her room since.
“Please tell me that look on your face isn't what I think it is and you're
not thinking naughty thoughts when we're about to help a bunch of kids
learn to play hockey.”
I glance over at Lowell as he takes a seat beside me on the bench.
“Want me to lie?”
“I swear, you dudes in relationships make me sick.”
“I'm not in a relationship.”
He slaps his leg. “Oh, right. I forgot. You're fake married. My bad.”
“Shut the fuck up, you dick.” I glance around, making sure Coach didn't
hear anything he said. “Coach doesn't know it's fake.”
“I figured as much. How'd he take the news anyway?”
“He's Coach, so about as well as you'd expect.”
Coach Heller—or Coach Hell as we call him—is a force to be reckoned
with. He might be getting up there in age now, but there's no doubt in my
mind that the old enforcer wouldn't strap on a pair of skates and whoop all
our asses any day of the week.
“He say anything about Colter?”
“Just don't retaliate.”
“The captain in me says that's good advice. But the friend in me…well,
it makes me want to wipe the fucking ice with his ass when we play
Florida.”
I laugh. “Thanks, man.”
“How are things going with the lovely missus anyway?”
Something in the way he says it makes me wonder if he ever had a thing
for Ryan. I always thought he might have a crush on her but was too shy to
pull the trigger.
That same feeling I had when I saw Miller sitting next to Ryan on the
plane streaks through me at the thought of Lowell and Ryan together.
I don't like the idea one fucking bit.
I push it all aside, not wanting to deal with what it means right now, and
shrug. “It's okay, I guess. We're mostly still tiptoeing around each other.”
He shakes his head. “I still can't believe you got drunk married. You. I
mean, I expect that shit from Miller, but not you.” I glare at him, not
appreciating the comparison. “How long are you keeping up the act?”
“A year.”
“A year?” His brows shoot up, and he whistles. “That's a long time.
Think you'll last that long?”
I do, and that's solely based on how relieved she was when I told her I'd
pay for her grandmother's care.
Growing up, my parents sacrificed so much for my hockey career, and
as much as they tried to hide it, I know what kind of financial burden it was
on them. I can't imagine how Ryan's felt the last few years taking care of
her grandmother. If I can help alleviate that in any way, I'm going to.
My phone buzzes against the bench, pulling my attention.
I look over at the screen. It's a number I don't recognize.
“You going to answer that?”
I shake my head. “Nah. I'll let voicemail get it. Probably nothing
important anyway.”
I've been getting a lot of calls lately. Most are from people wanting an
interview or quote about my recent nuptials. I've ignored them all.
“Rhodes, Lowell, you going to sit around on your asses all day
gossiping, or are we going to teach these kids some hockey?” Collin calls
from across the ice, throwing his hands in the air and waving 'em like he
just don't care.
“You going to let him talk to you like that, captain?” I say to Lowell as
we rise onto our skates.
“Not a chance.”
Lowell charges toward Collin, who sees him coming, and the two
tumble down to the ice, wrestling and trading light punches as the kids
cheer them on.
I sigh at their antics and skate past them.
Only in hockey.
The house is quiet when I get home from my evening workout, and I'm not
surprised by it one bit. Over the last few weeks, every time I come home,
Ryan hides in her bedroom. I'm usually able to coax her out for dinner in
the evenings, but it's always like a scene from a movie where the parents
who clearly need to be divorced sit at opposite ends of the table and eat in
awkward silence.
I think she's still embarrassed by what happened between us that first
night.
But something about tonight seems different. Seems off.
I stop at the fridge for a bottle of water, leaning against the counter as I
drink it. I listen closely for any signs of movement in the house, but I hear
nothing.
Huh. Weird.
After I finish my drink, I toss the bottle into the recycling and head
down the hall toward Ryan's room. There's a soft glow of light coming
from beneath her door, which isn't atypical.
I rap my knuckles against the wood, but there's no answer.
I knock again. Same response.
“Ryan?” I call out.
Silence.
I push the door open gently, and the moment there's a small crack, Poe
darts out of the room, taking off down the hall.
I don't bother chasing after her. She'll find her way back here, I'm sure.
A laptop sitting on the desk in the corner catches my attention.
I shouldn't look at it. I know that.
But I can't stop my feet when they carry me across the room. And I
can't help it that my fingers accidentally run across the trackpad, waking
the computer up.
The screen comes to life, and a photo fills the screen.
No, not a photo. More than that, it's an invitation to an exhibit featuring
photographer Ryan Bell, and it's tonight.
What the…
She has an exhibit? And tonight?
Annoyance races through me, and a little bit of hurt too.
Why the hell wouldn't she tell me about it? I'm her husband, for fuck's
sake!
Okay, not really her husband, but at the very least, I thought we were
friends. I should be there.
I check the time. It's 8:00 PM.
Shit. By the time I get there, it'll be nearly over.
But if I make my shower quick, I should be able to make some of it…
So that's what I do. I rush to my bathroom and hop in the shower,
speeding up my routine. When I get out, I dress in one of the suits I wear to
my games. I have no idea if this is a black-tie affair, but the word exhibit
sounds fancy enough to me and that's what I'm going with.
If she wanted me to show up in anything else, maybe she should have
told me about this.
I make sure Poe and Frodo both have food in their bowls, then rush out
the door. I hop in my SUV, plug the address into my navigation system, and
hit the road.
On the drive there, I run a million reasons through my head for why
Ryan wouldn't invite me.
Does she not want to share this part of her with me?
Does she not want me there?
Is she…embarrassed by me?
But fuck all of those excuses. I'm going.
I'm going and I will be the best goddamn supportive fake husband there
is.
I pull into a parking garage downtown and pay the premium for VIP
parking, then walk the block to the studio.
I've walked by this place several times but have never really paid it
much attention before. I'm not an artsy type of guy, so it's never been on
my radar.
I stop just outside the window to take a peek at the crowd.
Holy shit. The place is packed, and I'm not as mad anymore as pride
fills my chest knowing all these people are here for Ryan.
I open the door and soft smooth jazz hits my ears. People turn to stare,
and I see the recognition spark in their eyes almost instantly.
Shit. I did not think this part through.
It's a crowd. I fucking hate crowds.
It's funny. Before I got my scar, I had no qualms about being the center
of attention. I mean, I was sixteen and a hockey player. I lived for attention.
The moment I walked away from that skate blade, everything changed.
I was still a great hockey player. But more than that, I was a great
hockey player with a tragic story, and suddenly everybody cared more
about my story than they did my stats.
That was a bitter pill to swallow because I had been playing hockey
longer than I'd had my scar. People should have cared about that, not what
happened to me. I wanted to quit so many times. Wanted to give up the
game I love because I couldn't stand the attention any longer.
But I didn't. And while I still hate the attention, I play anyway.
I might have had my good looks taken away from me, but I'm not going
to let this fucking scar steal my love of the game too.
People still hide behind their hands and whisper. They still bring it up
all the time. Very few have actually outright asked me about it.
But the thing that hurts the most is the stares.
And that's exactly what I'm getting now.
I don the scowl I'm notorious for and push through the crowd in search
of Ryan. Over in the corner, there is a group of people gathered, and I just
know in my gut Ryan is at the center of it.
I grab a glass of champagne from one of the waiters strolling around the
room and take a healthy drink of it.
Ugh. I fucking hate champagne.
I stand at the periphery of the crowd, watching her command it.
Her blonde hair is twisted into a low-slung bun. It looks messy and
elegant all at the same time, and the sudden urge to walk over there, pull it
down, and run my fingers through it hits me.
She's wearing a skintight wine-colored satin dress that hits just above
her knee. The shade of lipstick painted across her lips matches it perfectly.
That same pair of stiletto heels she threw around the hotel room is on her
feet, making her legs look a mile long. A dainty pair of diamond earrings
hang from her ears, long enough to brush her shoulders, and there's a silver
bracelet around her wrist.
Somehow her outfit looks simple and stunning all at once.
She's talking with some older gentleman who keeps putting his hand on
her forearm and stepping closer to her despite her continually stepping
back. She's smiling politely, but even from here, I can see she's
uncomfortable with his closeness.
A protective streak I didn't even know I possessed rushes through me,
and before I know it, I'm crossing the small floor and sliding my arm
around her waist, hugging her to me.
I instantly feel her relax with my touch. She hasn't even glanced in my
direction, yet somehow, she knows it's me.
I like that she knows it's me.
I press a gentle kiss on her cheek. “Hey, wife.”
I've called her wife many times, and every time she's looked at me like
she wants to strangle me.
Except for now.
The only thing I see in her eyes now is relief. She's glad I'm here.
She grins up at me. “Hey, husband. I'm so glad you could finally make
it.”
“Sorry. I got held up at the rink.” It's not entirely a lie. I was down at
the practice facility in the weight room and time did get away from me. I
squeeze her waist. “But I'm here now. You look stunning.”
Her eyes spark with surprise at my compliment because she can tell it's
genuine.
“Thank you,” she says, and I see the blush steal up her cheeks.
I turn to the older gentleman who kept touching her, sticking my hand
out and rising to my full height. I tower over him with ease. “I don't think
we've had the pleasure of meeting yet. I'm Adrian Rhodes, Ryan's
husband.”
He must know who I am because his eyes flare with interest as he slips
his hand in mine. “Wow. The Beast in the flesh. My son is going to be so
jealous I'm meeting you.” He looks between Ryan and me. “I had no idea
you two were married.”
“Newly married,” Ryan explains.
“And wildly in love.” I place a loud, wet kiss to her cheek. “Right, baby
cakes?”
Ryan's lips tighten at the nickname, but only for a second. Then, she
beams at me and places her hand on my chest, snuggling closer to me. “So
in love, honey bun.”
“How…sweet.” He gives us a curt smile, then excuses himself.
The moment he's out of earshot, Ryan puts a bit of space between us.
“Baby cakes? Wildly in love? Really?”
“Just staking my claim.”
“Claim, huh?”
“Yes.” I drop my lips to her ear and hear the hitch in her breath when
my lips graze across her skin. “This marriage might not be traditional, but
make no mistake—you're mine for the next year.”
She lets out a little squeak, and I can see the goose bumps break out
across her body. She recovers quickly, bringing the champagne flute to her
lips, but with the way the liquid shakes in her glass, it's obvious she's
rattled.
I straighten back up and look out over the crowd. “Thanks for the invite,
by the way.”
“I…I didn't think you'd want to come.”
I pinch my eyebrows together. “Why wouldn't I want to come? You're
my wife.”
“You hate crowds.”
“I'd sit in a crowd of a hundred thousand people if it meant being there
to support you.”
She seems surprised by this, and honestly, I'm surprised too because I
actually mean the words.
Her photography is important to her, so it's important to me. Besides,
she's putting herself out there in a very public way to support my hockey
career. This is the least I can do for her.
“Well, thank you,” she says quietly. “I appreciate that.”
“You're welcome. And next time, invite me.”
“Okay.”
For the first time, a comfortable silence falls over us.
I take another sip of my champagne and make a face. Fuck, I really hate
this stuff.
“So, this…show,” I say. “What exactly is it?”
“It's an interactive exhibit.”
“Like the one you did with Harper and Collin?”
“Sort of. This one is about something different though.”
“What's that?”
“It's…” She hesitates for a moment. “It's about flaws.” I stiffen at her
words. “And finding the beauty in them.” Her eyes flit toward my scar.
“Because they're all beautiful.”
“Is that so?”
She nods. “Yes. And I prove it to the subjects by putting their images up
for sale. With their permission, of course. And they do. Sell, I mean.”
“Hmm.”
“Would you like to try it?”
I don't answer her because I'm stunned by her request.
“You don't have to, of course. It's just…well, I would just like to
photograph you. If you'd let me.” She tucks an errant strand of hair behind
her ear, not making eye contact with me. She's nervous. Ryan doesn't do
nervous.
I'm speechless. She wants to photograph…me?
“I'm sorry,” she says. “Forget I asked. I'm going to…” Her words trail
off as she begins to walk away.
I don't let her.
I wrap my hand around her wrist and tug her back to me.
She peers up, her green eyes round with surprise.
“Yes.”
“Pardon?”
“Yes.” I swallow the sudden lump in my throat. “You can photograph
me.”
I don't know why I say it. I think it's the sincerity in her eyes. Either
way, it's out there now, and I can't take it back. Not when she's looking at
me with pure excitement at the idea.
“Follow me.”
I let her lead me to the other side of the room. We're stopped a few
times by people who want to congratulate her on her exhibit that's wrapping
up. When we finally make it over there, she tugs me inside the little
makeshift room.
The moment we step inside, it's complete silence.
“Soundproof,” she explains, locking the door behind her. “So there are
no distractions.”
I nod. “Makes sense.”
The space is much longer and narrower than I expected it to be. And the
only thing inside is this single stall toward the back and Ryan's camera.
“The idea of the project is that I ask people what they believe their
flaws are, and I photograph them.”
“So, what? You just take pictures of people's imperfections?”
“Yes, but we have to remember that not everyone's flaws are external.
Some people have internal flaws. The subject takes a seat at the stool across
the room. I'll ask a few questions to start, and then from there, you can
either show me your flaws or you can talk about them. Either way, I'll be
capturing the whole experience on video and taking photos.”
I nod. “I see. And the purpose of this is…?”
“Sometimes we just need to see ourselves from a different angle.
Through someone else's eyes.”
“That seems simple enough.”
I cross the small room, stopping right in front of the stool.
My hands are shaking just the slightest bit, and I shove them in my
pockets so she doesn't see.
I'm nervous, which is ridiculous really because it's pretty damn obvious
what my biggest flaw is.
She watches me closely, finger poised and ready to press record.
I can tell she's conflicted inside. The photographer in her is thrilled to
have another subject, but the people part of her knows this is hard on so
many levels.
Finally, I take a seat.
“Things might get a little awkward at home afterward.”
Her brows draw tight together. “Why is that?”
“Well, because I have to whip my dick out.”
She sputters. “W-What?”
I nod solemnly. “Yeah. My cock. It's just…huge. So heavy to carry
around. A burden, really. Definitely my biggest flaw.”
“See, I would have thought it was your not-so-sparkling personality.”
“Not-so-sparkling? You're telling me you don't see the rainbows and
glitter always shooting out my ass?”
She tucks her lips together, crossing her arms over her chest. “Are you
quite finished, Rhodes?”
“Yes, ma'am.” I wink at her, the tension in the room now thinned. I rub
my hands over my thighs and nod once. “Hit record.”
There's a barely audible click as she presses the button and a red light
sparks to life. They're the only indications that she's recording.
“What is your name, age, and occupation?”
“My name is Adrian Tyler Rhodes. I am twenty-seven years old, and I
am an NHL defenseman for the Carolina Comets.”
“Do you believe you are flawed, Adrian?”
I don't know why, but hearing her say my first name does something to
me that I'm not expecting. In the time I've known her, not once has she
called me Adrian. And to my surprise, I like it.
I don't look at the camera; I look at her. “Aren't we all flawed in one
way or another?”
“I suppose so. Is that why you're here though? Because you're flawed?”
“Honestly, I'm just here so I can get my wife to show me her titties later
tonight.”
“Even the wonky one?”
“Especially the wonky one.”
She barely holds in her laughter. “If this goes well, I'm sure she'll take
that into consideration.”
“So behave? Got it.”
She shakes her head, smiling. “If you had to pick out a singular flaw for
yourself, what would it be?”
I clear my throat and look away from her penetrating gaze. I tug at my
dress pants, that nervous itchy feeling returning. “I think it's pretty obvious,
no?”
“Not to me.”
My gaze snaps back to hers, and somehow, I know it's not photographer
Ryan talking to me; it's the Ryan I know.
“It happened during a routine practice the summer I turned sixteen. It
was at a sleepaway hockey camp I attended every year. I knew that place
like the back of my hand, and I knew the players out there with me. They
were all good guys. Nobody would ever intentionally hurt anyone else, and
that day was no different. We were running board drills and I guess I lost an
edge, and I went down. Unfortunately for me, the guy I was running the
drill with didn't realize I went down. His focus was solely on getting the
puck out, just like it should have been. His skate came back and it caught
me right under the visor, sliced me from here”—I point to the spot just
below my eye—“to here.” I drag my finger along the scar, stopping where it
ends at my chin.
I hear the click of the camera as I move my fingers and try hard not to
flinch.
“What happened after that?” Ryan asks, still clicking away.
“I…I don't remember.” I run a hand through my hair. “I think I passed
out pretty quick. Shock, blood loss…I have no clue. I woke up in the
hospital looking like a monster.” I huff out a humorless laugh. “My face
was a disaster, puffy and bruised. I looked just like you'd imagine. God, I
remember the look on my mom's face when I woke up. She was so fucking
relieved that I was alive. And I was relieved too, ya know? I was okay. I
still had my vision. I would still play hockey. But then when I looked in the
mirror, I…”
I clear my throat, trying hard as hell to ignore the way it's tightening.
“The hockey camp was out in the middle of nowhere, and the doctor at
the nearest hospital completely botched fixing it. He'd never seen anything
like it before and had no clue what he was doing. I had two plastic surgeries
to fix it, and I still fucking look like this.”
All those same feelings from back then come rushing in.
“Before that, I wasn't one to obsess about my looks. I was an averagelooking kid who blended in with the crowd. But after…after I was this
whole new person. Suddenly, I wasn't average. I was disfigured and ugly.
Little kids in the stores would stare at me, and my friends stopped wanting
to be seen with me. My scar was all I was. And sometimes…” I exhale
shakily. “Sometimes I think it's all I'll ever be. I'm going to carry this…
ugliness around with me forever. Who the fuck wants to love a beast like
me?”
Ryan sets her camera aside, then crosses the small room.
She doesn't stop until she's standing between my legs. She takes my
face in her hands, running her thumb gently over my scar and the tears that
are dripping down my cheeks.
I didn't even realize I was crying. Why the fuck am I crying?
She leans forward and presses her lips to the jagged, marred skin.
She's kissing it. She's fucking kissing my scar.
She's kissing my scar, and she's kissing my soul.
“Adrian…” She whispers my name, trailing her lips across the part of
me I hate the most and somehow making me hate it less. “You're beautiful.
Not despite your scar, but because of it.”
They're the same words she said to me that night in Vegas. I wasn't sure
she meant them then, but I know she means them now.
I swallow thickly. “Ryan?”
“Yes?”
“That kissing rule…you said I could only kiss you if it's warranted,
right?”
“Yes.”
“Does this count as warranted?”
She sighs against me. “Yes.”
And I claim my kiss.

RYAN
Everything else ceases to exist.
The only thing that matters at this moment is Rhodes and the way his
mouth is moving against mine.
I know he joked before about his kisses being good and like sex, but I'm
starting to think he wasn't too far off the mark.
If this is how it feels just to kiss Rhodes, I can't wait for more.
My fingers brush along his face, wiping away the tears I don't think he
realized he was shedding. His story…it almost broke me. He was so raw
and real and open. It was a side of him I've never seen before.
And it was a side of him I'd like to see again.
His fingers dig into my hips as he tugs me closer. Slowly, he bunches up
the material, dragging it up my waist until I feel the cool air on my bare ass.
All the while his mouth is moving over mine in perfect strokes.
His hands run over my bare ass, and I moan.
He breaks the kiss for the first time, peering up at me with glassy eyes.
“Are you wearing underwear, Ryan?”
I shake my head. “No. Didn't want panty lines.”
A low growl rumbles through his chest. “You left the house without
panties?” I nod, and he glowers at me. “I don't like that.”
“I don't care what you like,” I say, lifting a challenging brow.
His eyes darken as he lifts my dress higher until my pussy is exposed,
not stopping until it's bunched around my waist. I shiver as the cool air hits
me.
His hands knead at my cheeks, then he rubs down my thighs, digging
his fingers into me just enough that it stings a little.
“God, you smell so fucking good.” He nuzzles his nose against my
stomach, inhaling me. He nips at me a bit, licking away the stings with
short strokes as I slide my hands through his hair.
“No one can see us in here, right?”
“No. Nor hear us.”
“Good.” He places a kiss just below my belly button, then slides off the
stool and onto his knees right in front of me. “Spread your legs, darling. I
need to taste you.”
For once, I don't hate the pet name…and I do as I'm told.
I widen my stance and close my eyes, waiting.
But nothing happens.
I look down and he's just sitting there, staring up at me.
“That's much better.”
I furrow my brow. “Huh?”
“If you want me to eat your pussy, you'll have to watch. Got it?”
Oh. Oh.
I gulp, nodding. “Okay.”
“No. Say Yes, husband.”
Another gulp. “Yes, husband.”
“Very good.”
Without breaking eye contact, he flattens his tongue and runs it over my
clit. My eyes begin to flutter closed at just the barest of touches, and he
backs off.
I want to scream in frustration, but I also want to please him.
I open my eyes again, and he grins wickedly, then returns between my
legs.
This time, I make sure to follow directions. I don't close my eyes. I
don't even dare blink.
I hold his gaze as he laps at me. Stroke after torturous stroke, his hands
kneading my ass cheeks over and over again until I'm literally bucking
against him.
Even though I'm looking right at him, I don't see it coming.
I let out a loud yelp that turns into a moan as he lands a loud thwack to
my bare ass.
My eyes flare as he grins up at me around my pussy as he massages my
no-doubt-red stinging cheek.
He remembers.
Rhodes lands another blow, then another, and my knees begin to shake
so violently I have no idea how I'm still standing.
How? How is it possible he has me this close to the edge so quickly?
It's like he's inside my head and knows just exactly what I like. There's no
way anything can compare to this.
He smacks my ass again, and I know I'm seconds away from an
orgasm.
He knows it too.
He sucks my clit into his mouth, applying the perfect amount of
pressure, then smacks my ass again.
I break.
I'm rocked by the most intense orgasm of my life, my legs quaking so
hard I can barely stand. Rhodes has to physically hold me up.
I ride the wave as he continues to gently lick at me. With one last long,
slow stroke, he sits back on his haunches.
His eyes are darker than I've ever seen before, and his face is shining
with the evidence of my orgasm. I'm incredibly turned on by the sight and
am slightly sad when he wipes the back of his hand across it.
He rises to his feet, keeping his hands on my waist because even he
knows if he lets me go, there's no way I'll be able to stay upright.
He presses gentle kisses up across my jaw and down my neck, then
back up until he captures my lips. He gives me a quick peck, then pulls
back, cradling my face and tilting it up.
“Thank you,” he says quietly.
Thank me? Pfft. I should be thanking him.
“Thank you for letting me tell you my story.”
Oh. That.
I wrap my arms around his waist, holding him close. “Thank you for
telling me. And for the orgasm.”
He chuckles. “Trust me, the pleasure was all mine. But, Ryan?”
“Yeah?”
“I still definitely want to see your titties when we get home.”
Sitting through the rest of my exhibit was torture. Cleaning up afterward?
Even worse.
And it's all because of the looks Rhodes kept sending my way.
Every time I looked at him, I blushed. Having his eyes on me was a
permanent reminder of what we did in the booth. And a reminder of how
badly I wanted to do it again.
When we finally push through the front door of the house, I am more
than ready to rip my clothes off and let him have his way with me.
Apparently, he has the same idea.
The door isn't even latched, and he has me pinned against the wall, my
dress hiked back up around my hips and one of my legs thrown around his
waist. Based on the way his cock is pressing against my core, he wants this
just as badly as I do.
His lips find my neck and he bites and sucks at me. I just know I'm
going to have marks tomorrow. At this point, I don't care.
He claims my mouth again, his hand climbing up my throat, applying
just enough pressure to make my knees shake with desire.
“Please,” I beg. “I need…”
“What? What do you need?” he says against me. “Tell me what you
need.”
“You. Just you.”
He crashes his mouth to mine and palms my ass, pulling me up until I
wrap my legs around his waist. He carries us down the hall, not stopping
until we reach his bedroom. With my legs still around him, he puts one knee
on the foot of his bed, slowly dropping me onto my back.
He wrenches his mouth from mine.
“I want to savor you and devour you all at once.”
I want that too. But I say, “Devour now. Savor later.”
So he does.
He shoves his suit jacket off, then undoes his pants, pushing them down
just enough to free that damn beautiful cock of his.
I want to see it. I want to taste it.
But not now.
Now, I just want him.
He bunches my dress around my waist and then slips his hand between
my legs.
“So wet,” he mutters. “So fucking wet and so fucking perfect.”
He wraps one arm around me, his hand fisting my hair. With the other,
he lines his cock up with my core, then pushes inside me.
There's no preamble. No going slow.
We are straight-up fucking at this point, and it's just what I need.
I slide my hands into his hair, tugging at the strands and pulling his lips
down to mine as he slams into me over and over again.
I need to kiss him. Need to feel him fuck my mouth with his tongue as
he fucks my pussy with his cock.
“Holy shit,” he moans, breaking the kiss but not his stride. “You feel
fucking incredible. Better than I imagined.”
“You've imagined me?”
He gives me a look. “You know I have.” He ruts into me again. “You
know I do.”
He kisses me again, slowing his movements. But I don't want slow. I
want fast. I want hard. I want more.
I try to pick up the pace, but he doesn't let me.
“Stop,” he says against my lips. “I'm seriously about to embarrass
myself if we keep this up.”
“It's fine, Rhodes.”
“It's not.”
I pull away, grabbing his face, brushing my thumb against his scar. “It's.
Fine. I want this. Please. Fuck me.”
That same rumbly growl from earlier moves through him again, and he
strokes in and out of me with a newfound purpose.
I can feel my orgasm building. Getting closer and closer to that sweet,
sweet high.
I just need…
Like he can read my mind, Rhodes slips his hand between us, his thumb
pressing against my clit as he bucks into me.
Oh. That.
I count down in my head.
One.
Two.
And I explode.
I squeeze my eyes shut as my pussy clenches around him. Rhodes lets
out a string of cuss words, and I know he's not far behind at all.
“Oh, fuck. No. Fuck, fuck.”
“What?” I ask. Or at least I think it sounds like what. My brain is so
scrambled right now I can't tell up from down.
“Condom—I forgot a condom.”
“Birth control. I have an implant. Recent checkup. All good.”
He laughs. “You're talking in caveman, and it's kind of doing things to
me.”
“Shut up.”
“I'm good too. We get tested regularly by the doc.”
I nod because it's all I can muster at this point.
“You know,” he says, “at least if you did get pregnant, it wouldn't be
out of wedlock.”
I groan. “Rhodes…”
“What? I'm just saying.”
“I swear…I'll—Oh! Holy fuckinggoddamnshitballsfuck!”
“That's a mouthful. Rhodes will do just fine.” His thumb is back on my
clit and he's hitting that just right angle inside of me.
“Don't stop. What you're doing right now, do. Not. Stop.”
He doesn't.
And before I know it, I'm going off again, and this time he follows right
along behind me.
Just like there was no real beginning, there's no real end.
Rhodes rolls off me, and all that can be heard is our harsh breaths
echoing around the room.
I'm pretty sure I died.
I must have. There's no way I can have three orgasms in a night and this
not be heaven.
“Are we dead?”
The bed shakes with his laughter. “I think so. Oddly enough, I'm okay
with it.”
“Same.”
His hand finds mine and he tangles our fingers together. He rubs at my
wedding ring like he always does.
“I hate to bring this up to you right now, but I told you you'd want me.”
I roll my eyes. “Shut up, Rhodes.”
Somehow—and I don't know how he does it—he rolls over until he's
hovering just above me.
He grins down at me. “Make me…wife.”
And I do.
When I wake with an arm wrapped tightly around my waist, déjà vu washes
over me.
I've been here before. This same position with this same person.
Except this time, I don't regret waking up this way.
Rhodes tightens his arm around me and drags me as he rolls over, and
suddenly, I'm right back where I started—straddling him topless.
“I swear, if you make one comment about my wonky tit, I'm going to
poke you in the eye with it.”
He grins, not opening his eyes. “If you think that's a threat, it's really
not.”
“It should be.”
“But it's not.” He squeezes my ass, peeling his eyes open slowly. “How
the hell are you awake right now? We barely slept last night.”
I shrug. “Woke up to something poking me in the back.”
“Wonder what that could be.” He shoves his hips up, pushing said
something against me.
“Does that thing even work anymore?”
“Not sure. Want to test it out?”
I groan, then roll off him. “No way. I'm sore in places I didn't even
realize I could be sore.”
“Huh, really? Because I distinctly remember you saying no to anal.”
I side-eye him. “Funny.” I push myself up, resting back against the
headboard. “I wasn't kidding. Everything hurts right now. My legs, my
arms, my pussy. I feel like I did a weightlifting competition or something.”
He sits up next to me, hooking his arms behind his head. “It's times like
these it pays to be a hockey player. I've got stamina for days.”
“Are you always this gloaty after sex?”
“Nah.” He gives me a lopsided grin. “Just after really good sex.”
I grin. Good answer.
But it is weird to see him so…chipper.
I'm used to grumpy Rhodes, not smiley Rhodes.
“Don't worry. I'll be back to my grumpy self shortly,” he promises, like
he can read my mind.
Speaking of grumpy Rhodes…
I spring from the bed, new life breathed into me, and take off toward the
living room. He calls after me, but I ignore him and head straight for my
camera bag.
I didn't get a chance to look over the photos from last night, and I'm
dying to see how they turned out. I flip through the images until I come
across the set of Rhodes.
I gasp the moment I see them.
He looks…heartbreaking. And haunting. And so fucking beautiful.
“Hey,” he says, padding into the living room. “Where'd you go?”
I push up from my crouch and wave my camera at him.
“The photos from last night—I wanted to see them.”
A conflicted look flits across his face. I can tell a part of him wants to
see them and a part of him doesn't want to be reminded of his scar at all.
But he needs to see these. I can sense it in my gut.
I navigate back to the first one and turn my camera toward him. His
fingers tremble as he takes it from me, but I don't dare say anything about
it. I watch him as he clicks through slowly. He takes his time looking at
them all, studying them.
When he gets to the last one, he closes his eyes.
It's the one of him crying.
After several moments, he peels his eyes open, looking down at me. “Is
this…is this how you see me?”
I nod. “I meant it when I said you were beautiful, Rhodes. I wish you
could see that too.”
“But my scar. It's…”
“Part of you but not all of you.”
His throat bobs. “I…”
He looks away, running the palm of his hand over his face and sniffling.
“Fuck,” he mutters. When he looks back at me, his eyes are shiny with
unshed tears. “Thank you, Ryan.”
“No, thank you. Thank you for showing me the real you. It's about time
I got to meet him.”
Without another word, he scoops me into his arms and carries me back
to the bedroom.
I have no idea how long we stay there, but I know it's not long enough.

RHODES
“Come on, Batesy, let's pick it up!”
“I'm trying, Coach!”
I shake my head at the lip the kid is giving me. “He's skating like shit.”
“Dude, he's like ten,” Smith, the oldest guy on our team and one of our
best centers, reminds me.
“So? I could skate way better than that at ten. I swear, it's the water
these kids are drinking nowadays. It's too clean. They just need a good oldfashioned sip out of a water hose.”
“Okay, grandpas,” Miller says, skating by us.
I glare at him. “You know what? You go skate too. You need the
practice.”
“And a lesson to not back talk your elders.”
“You got elders right,” he sasses back at Smith. “I could skate laps
around both of you.”
“Maybe, but would you care to wager on who could throw the heaviest
punch?” I ask, taking a step toward him.
I swear I hear his asshole pucker. “You know what? I think a few laps
do sound good.”
Huh. Maybe Miller is smarter than he looks.
“That's what I thought, rookie,” I call after him as he skates off down
the ice.
Smith chuckles, shaking his head. “Kid exhausts me.”
“Same.”
“By the way, I've been meaning to tell you congratulations on the whole
marriage thing. Sorry I didn't get you a gift, but I guess it was kind of last
minute, huh? I will say, I'm surprised you got hitched. Didn't really expect
that one.”
“Bit of a surprise for me too,” I mutter, but can't help the grin that
stretches across my lips. It might have been a surprise, but I can't say I'm
hating it so far.
Especially not the whole waking up with a naked Ryan in my bed every
morning part.
“It looks good on you though. Marriage, I mean. You look happy for a
change. Guess that makes me the grumpy one now, huh?”
He wasn't always like that, but last season something in him changed.
You think winning the Cup would get him out of his funk, but he can't seem
to shake it.
I want to ask him what's up, but I don't want to press. Smith is
definitely the type of guy who will let you know when he's ready to talk,
and right now, he's not.
He claps me on the shoulder, then nods toward Miller. “I'm gonna go
make sure the rookie isn't corrupting the children.”
Smith skates away and Collin takes his place.
“How long have you been lurking there?” I ask him.
“Long enough. He was right, you know. Marriage does look good on
you.”
“Shut up,” I grumble.
Collin laughs. “How are things going with Ryan anyway?”
Things with Ryan are…incredible.
She's incredible.
I can't remember the last time she spent the night in her own room, or
the last time she hid away to only come out for dinner.
And it's not even the out-of-this-world sex that makes everything so
incredible. It's like whatever happened between us the night of her exhibit a
few weeks ago changed everything.
Things have been good. Easy. Simple.
I like good and easy and simple, especially in a situation as complicated
as this.
Neither of us have talked about exactly what it is we're doing, but I'm
okay with that because I'm not sure I'm ready to dissect it.
“Oh, I take it they are good, then,” Collin says.
I glance over at him. “What do you mean? I didn't even say anything.”
“Trust me, bud. You didn't have to. It's obvious you're in love.”
I glower. “Fuck off. I am not.”
“Yes, you are. And that's cool. Totally fine. I mean, a little backassward
that you fell in love with your wife after you married her, but still cool.”
“I'm not in love with her,” I say through clenched teeth.
He pats me on the back. “Right. Sure.”
“Stop fucking patronizing me.”
He holds his hands up innocently. “I'm not.”
“You are.”
“No, I'm not.”
“You are fucking too.”
He smirks. “See how annoying it is when people lie straight to your
face?”
I charge at him, not stopping until our noses are nearly touching. He just
laughs.
“Be nice. The kids are watching.”
“Good. Maybe they can learn a thing or two about chirping a guy who is
bigger than them.”
“I'm not scared of you, Rhodes.”
“You fuckin' ought to be, Wright.”
“Guys, come on,” Lowell hollers across the ice. “Not in front of the
lady.”
I spin on my skates to find Ryan standing beside Lowell.
I almost forgot she was coming today to photograph the kids during
their last day of camp. We start our NHL version of hockey camp here next
week, and I can't wait. That buzz I love from playing the game is beginning
to simmer in my veins.
Hockey season is so close I can almost taste it, and damn am I hungry
for it.
I skate across the ice, stopping in front of Lowell and Ryan.
She grins at me, looking absolutely adorable in her puffy gray jacket
and beanie with the little fuzzy ball on top.
“Wife,” I say.
“Husband,” she responds, her cheeks growing pink.
“Gag,” Lowell comments, hopping onto the ice to go round up the kids,
I'm sure.
“How's your day, snookums?” I ask her once we're alone.
“Just wonderful, schmoopy.”
“Schmoopy? Really?”
“I could say the same about snookums.”
Unable to help myself, I lean across the boards and press my lips to hers
in a quick kiss.
She gasps, surprised.
I'm surprised too. I'm not one for PDA even in a real relationship, so
I'm surprised I'm doing it in a fake one. I can't seem to control myself
when it comes to Ryan though, and I've not determined yet if that's a good
or bad problem to have.
My phone buzzes against the bench, pulling my attention, and Ryan
points to it.
“That yours?”
“Yeah, but it's probably just a spam call. I've been getting a lot of them
lately.” I let it go to voicemail. “Did you get those tutorials edited today?”
She nods. “Yep. Two of them.”
It's kind of weird knowing a person who does YouTube for a living.
Some days I'll come home, and Ryan won't be wearing a stitch of makeup.
Other days she looks like a zombie—literally.
But she seems to enjoy what she does, and that's all that matters. I'll
never admit this to anyone, but sometimes when she's asleep, I go on there
and watch them just to help her with views.
“And I took Frodo out for a walk. Oh! They did it again! You have to
see!” She pulls her phone out and taps around a few times, then shoves it in
my face. “Aren't they so cute?!”
We were worried Poe and Frodo wouldn't get along well, so we made
sure to introduce them slowly. Turns out, we didn't have to worry about a
thing. This is now the third time we've caught them snuggled up together in
Frodo's bed. I'm glad he'll have a friend in Ryan and Poe while I'm away
for hockey games.
“I'm pretty sure Poe loves Frodo more than me now.”
“Well, that's not a big feat. Have you seen Frodo?”
She pushes her chest out. “Okay, but have you seen me and my sweet,
sweet rack?”
“A few times.” I shrug. “Not bad.”
Her brows crash together. “Not bad? Not bad?!”
“I've seen worse, I've seen better.”
“Adrian…” she warns.
“It kind of turns me on when you call me by my first name.”
“What about shithead? Does it turn you on when I call you shithead?”
“You know, can't say it does. No.”
“You are so—”
I lean over and kiss her again, slanting my mouth over hers and
claiming her for all to see.
She moans into my mouth, and just when I'm about to deepen the kiss,
it's ruined.
“All right, all right. Break it up. There are children present.”
“Yeah, Adrian, there are kids here.” Ryan giggles.
“Little cockblockers,” I mumble before turning around. “Okay,
everyone gather around.” I point at Ryan. “This is Ryan, my wife, and she's
going to be taking our group photo today, so everyone be on your best
behavior or it's me you'll be answering to, got it?”
They all nod, totally afraid of me just like I like them to be.
When I turn around, Ryan's staring at me with a look I don't quite
understand.
“What?” I ask.
“Nothing. It's nothing.” She shakes her head, then smiles. “All right,
everyone, this is how I want you…”
As she directs the kids where she wants them, Lowell and Collin skate
up to me, one on each side.
“Your wife, huh?” Collin says.
“Yeah. That's what she is.”
“Is she though? Because I thought—”
“Watch it,” I say, nodding toward Miller.
“Oh, Lowell, you didn't hear?” Collin says. “Our little Rhodes here is
totally in love with his wife.”
I sigh, pinching the bridge of my nose between my thumb and
forefinger. “Collin. I swear…”
“I'm still not scared, Rhodes.”
“Fuckin' should be,” I mutter.
“You two still hosting that party this weekend so we can all come over
and meet your wife?”
“Quit saying it like that.”
“Like what?”
“Like it's…”
“Like it's what?” Lowell leans into me. “Fake?”
I scowl, and they both laugh.
“Oh, yeah, he's totally in love,” Lowell agrees.
“Truly.”
“Madly.”
“Deeply.”
“Okay, Savage Garden, that's enough!” I bark. “Fuck. You two almost
make me want to hang out with the rookie.”
“Who, me?” Miller says, skating up to us. “I'll be your dream, I'll be
your wish, I'll be your fantasy!” he sings.
I shove past him, skating away from all three of the assholes.
“What? I thought we were singing!” Miller calls after me. “I still need
to be your hope, love, and everything you need!”
I flip them off.
They're all wrong.
“Dude, who brought the old broad? She's a hoot.”
Lowell groans. “Jesus, Miller, show some respect. This is Grams,
Ryan's grandmother. Grams, this is Miller, our resident rookie.”
“Oh shit. I mean SHOOT. SORRY, GRAMS.”
“Um, why are you shouting at my grandmother? She can hear perfectly
fine.”
Grams pats Miller on the cheek. “I am so glad you're good at hockey,
son. Don't lose that skill. You're going to need it.”
Miller blushes. “Thank you, ma'am?” It comes out as a question
because he has no idea if he's just been insulted or not.
Spoiler alert: he has been.
Grams is…well, she's fucking amazing. Basically an older version of
Ryan.
We got her moved into a new assisted living facility last week, and I
about shit myself when I saw the price. Not because I couldn't afford it. I
mean, I have enough money to last me a lifetime. I was shocked that Ryan
had been making payments like that for years.
Grams has only been in the new place a week, but she seems like she's
thriving there. Ryan said her attitude has improved by leaps and bounds.
And really, as long as she's happy, I don't care how much I'm paying for it.
By some miracle, we were able to keep our Oh hey, we got hitchedslash-end of summer party to a minimum number of guests. Most people
wanted to stay home with their families before all the real chaos starts next
week.
The party has dwindled to just the main crew now. We are currently
sitting outside at the patio table, shooting the shit.
Collin keeps looking over here smirking at me, and I think it's because
Ryan is sitting on my lap.
I have no idea why she is. I don't even think she knows why she is. But
I'm not about to change it.
“So, are you boys ready for the season?” Grams asks.
According to Ryan, she's become a big hockey fan in recent years. I
guess that means we're going to have to get her out to a game soon. It
would be fun to see her in the stands one night.
“Back-to-back, baby!” Miller shouts, holding his beer up.
He's convinced we're going back-to-back with the Cup championship.
I'm trying not to jinx it, and I think that's how a lot of the other guys on
the team feel about it too.
“We're ready, Viv,” Collin says. “You're coming to our home opener,
right?”
“And see my guys in action? I wouldn't miss it.”
“She just wants to see some hockey butts,” Harper says, nudging her.
“Right, Grams?”
“Well, heck yeah, girl. You know all about them. Your man has a dump
truck.”
“Grams!” Ryan reprimands. “What the…”
“What? That's what my new roommate, Nancy, says you call a nice, big
hockey butt.”
“Please tell Nancy I said thank you, and remind me to bring her a signed
jersey next time.” Collin grins, quite proud of himself.
“Nancy also said Lowell has ‘BDE,' but I don't know what that means.”
“Can confirm,” Lowell says.
“And that she was ‘DTF,' which I guess means ‘down to flirt,' with
Rhodes.”
“GRANDMOTHER!” Ryan screeches, her face turning redder than I've
ever seen before as we all snicker.
“What?” Grams holds her hands out, perplexed by Ryan's reaction. “I'm
just trying to warn you that Nancy is trying to flirt with your man.”
“Bet you won't fight her, Ryan,” Collin says.
“Shit, my money is on Nancy.”
Ryan glares at Lowell. “You're just saying that because she's in love
with your you know what.” She bends her head toward me, lowering her
voice to a whisper. “That's it. We're moving her back to the other place. I
can't handle her knowing all these slang words. That place is going to
corrupt my sweet grandmother.”
“Hate to break it to you, but I'm pretty sure your grandmother has been
corrupted,” I say back quietly. “The first time we met, she pinched my ass
and blamed it on the sleeping lady next to her.”
Ryan rolls her lips together, trying not to laugh. “Well, that's your fault
for having such a pinchable dump truck.”
“Keep it up, wife, and I'll give Nancy a call.”
“You wouldn't dare.”
“Guess we'll never know.” I wink, squeezing her hip and taking a sip of
my beer.
I was dreading today, was certain hosting this little party would be
exhausting and sitting here pretending to be married to Ryan and lying to all
our friends would be hard.
Except it wasn't exhausting. Not at all.
Because the truth is…I'm not so sure we're pretending anymore.

RYAN
Rhodes' parents are going to be here any second, and I could vomit.
It's one thing to pretend to be married in front of our friends—it oddly
didn't even feel pretend at all—but it's a whole other thing to pretend in
front of his parents.
I think another reason I'm feeling a little sick is that tomorrow Rhodes
has his first game of the season, and I'm genuinely nervous for him.
Before Harper met Collin, I wouldn't have been able to tell you a single
thing about hockey other than that the players are known for having great
butts. But watching Rhodes prep for the season over the last few weeks has
been so fascinating. His routines. The way he gets into his head and focused
on the game. It's all so…intense. I mean, Rhodes is an intense person in
general, but this is different.
There's also a small part of me that's a little sad hockey season is about
to officially kick off. I actually missed him when he was gone for preseason
games.
I wouldn't dare tell him that though. He'll let it go to his head.
I hear the garage door open, and I freeze in my tracks.
Oh no. They're here.
“I'm not ready!” I yell to a still empty house.
But it doesn't matter if I'm ready or not. It's happening.
“Well, this doesn't look good at all.”
I whirl around to find Rhodes standing in the open garage doorway.
He's looking back and forth between the item I'm holding and my wide
eyes.
“Are you that nervous that you're drinking this early?”
“What?” I chuckle, then cover my mouth because it sounds nervous. I
sound nervous. Which doesn't make me look suspiciously drunk at all. I
tuck the bottle of wine I'm holding behind my back. “I wasn't drinking it, I
swear. I was panic cleaning and remembered I left it in the freezer last night
and I was moving it to the fridge.”
“Panic cleaning?”
“Yeah, you know, that thing you do right before someone comes over.”
“Why are you panic cleaning? We have housekeepers.”
“Because I'm nervous!”
“Nervous? What's there to be nervous about?” Rhodes' mother elbows
past him and into the house, sending him a dirty look. “Oh, for heaven's
sake, go help your father unload the car.”
She continues into the kitchen, heading straight for me.
Then, she wraps me up in the warmest hug I've ever had and squeezes
me tight.
It's heaven. Actual heaven.
“Oh. My. Goodness. It is so nice to finally meet you!”
I squeeze her back just as tight. “Me? Pfft. It's so great to finally meet
you, Margaret!”
She's a petite woman with a soft middle. Her hair is the same tawny
color as Rhodes' and hangs in loose curls just beyond her shoulders. Her
eyes are a warm brown and her smile is bright enough to warm the room as
she beams at me.
“Call me Maggie,” she says. “You are family after all.”
She hesitates on the word family just the slightest, and I can hardly
blame her for that. With how suddenly Rhodes and I got married, it's no
wonder she'd have trouble using that term.
“I can't wait to get to know you. Rhodes has told me so much about
you.” He has? She laughs. “Oh, I can see the worry in your eyes.” She pats
my cheek. “There's nothing to be afraid of. It was all good things.”
Now I'm wondering what exactly it is he told her.
“Ha. I hope so. Rhodes speaks very highly of you and Oscar as well.”
She blushes when I say her husband's name like she's still completely
smitten with him. It's sweet. I want something like that.
For the briefest moment, I imagine what that could be like with Rhodes.
If he would still be smitten with me like that years later.
But I brush the thought off quickly. There won't be years for us. It's just
one year. And none of this is real.
Rhodes and his father come barreling through the door, and I can hear
they're talking hockey.
“I'm telling you, it's going to be St. Louis you have to watch for this
year. They're—” His father stops midsentence, his mouth dropping open as
he blinks at me.
I could do the same because I feel like I just met a time traveler. There's
no way this isn't just Future Rhodes here to trick me. The two look so alike
it's scary.
If Rhodes ages half as well as his father…damn.
Rhodes looks from me to his dad and then back again.
I lift my shoulders because I have no idea why Oscar is still staring at
me with a look of shock and awe. Or why he's raising his finger and
pointing at me.
“Holy shit! You're the alien chick!” Alien chick? “Son, why didn't you
tell me you were married to the alien girl?”
“I wasn't aware she was an alien.” Rhodes looks at me. “How could you
not tell me you're an alien? Great! Now the whole marriage is a sham!”
I tuck my lips in, trying hard not to laugh as he smirks at me, enjoying
our little inside joke.
“Well, she's not a real alien, but she does her makeup like one.”
Wait a minute… “You watch my videos?” I say to Rhodes' father.
He nods enthusiastically. “All the time. Every Tuesday like clockwork. I
love the video you did where you transformed into Lady Gaga.”
Maggie gasps. “I knew she looked familiar! You're The Beauty Bell!”
She looks at her son. “Why didn't you tell us?”
He shrugs. “I wasn't aware you two were avid makeup tutorial
connoisseurs.”
“Well, you know we were watching that Drag Race stuff on the TV, and
the way they transform themselves…well, it's hypnotizing! So amazing to
watch. We got on YouTube to find some more videos, one thing led to
another, and, well, here we are.”
My brows shoot up because I am truly and utterly flabbergasted. I was
not expecting this.
“Oh, you have to do one of your looks for us! We want to see the
behind-the-scenes magic!” Maggie claps her hands together. “It'll be so
fun!”
I inwardly groan. I will definitely have to find a way to get out of that.
It's awkward enough filming myself for YouTube sometimes. I can't
imagine doing it with an audience.
Rhodes looks at me. “I think my parents are bigger fans of yours than
they are of me.”
“No,” his father says at the same time his mother says, “Yes.”
We all laugh.
Maybe this visit won't be so bad after all.
“Oh, for fuck's sake, ref! Open your damn eyes! That wasn't a trip!”
And here I was thinking that based on the way Maggie sobbed during
the opening ceremonies as the Comets raised their Stanley Cup Champions
banner, she would be the more laid-back one during the game.
I was definitely wrong.
Oscar yanks on Maggie's #6 Rhodes jersey, tugging her back down into
her seat. “Now, Maggs, don't be getting yourself all worked up.”
Maggie flops back down in her chair, her beer splashing out over the
rim of her cup. She shakes her head. “I swear, these refs are just out to get
us tonight.”
I love how animated Maggie is watching Rhodes fly down the ice. She
loves watching her son play hockey, that much is obvious.
I love watching him play too.
I came to several games last season with Harper thanks to Collin
hooking us up with tickets, but I never felt as invested in the game as I do
now.
Then I cheered on the team.
Now I'm cheering on Rhodes.
“We're still up three–two, and we have a whole other period to play. We
got this. I've been watching their goalie and he's getting gassed pretty
quick. If they keep shooting top shelf blocker side, they'll be up five–two in
no time.”
“They've got to stay out of the damn box first,” Maggie says.
Honestly, I'm still a little lost on all the logistics of it, but I love
watching them play. If you take out all the hitting and punching and a bunch
of full-grown men just dogpiling on each other, it's a beautiful game.
Oh, who am I kidding? That part is beautiful too.
And hot. So, so hot.
I've been half-horny all night watching Rhodes out on the ice.
He scored a goal earlier, and when he did, he pointed his stick right at
me and winked. My panties have been soaked since.
Which is really inconvenient since I'm sitting next to his parents.
“I'm with Maggie on this one, Oscar. These refs are a damn joke
tonight,” Harper complains, shoving a handful of popcorn in her mouth.
I want to laugh because she's gone from not knowing what a hockey
puck was made of to criticizing the refs so fast since she started dating
Collin. It's cute how involved she is. Normally, Harper would be in the
WAG lounge, which is reserved for the wives and serious girlfriends, but
she hates it there and wanted to watch the game with us.
The buzzer sounds as the period comes to an end.
“We're going to grab some boiled peanuts and stretch our legs a bit.
Want us to bring you ladies anything back?” Oscar asks, pushing up out of
his seat.
I try not to wrinkle my nose at the mention of boiled peanuts, something
I could never get into. “Thank you, but I'm okay.”
“I'm good too, but thank you,” Harper says.
“All right, but if you need anything, just text us, dearies.” Maggie pats
my shoulder, then shimmies down the aisle to meet up with Oscar.
“So, how's it going with them?” Harper asks once they're out of
earshot.
“Good so far. They won't stop giving me suggestions on what character
I should turn myself into next, but it's fun still.”
“Not awkward at all? You pretending to be married to their son and all
that?”
“Actually, no. Not really.”
And it's the truth.
I love Rhodes' parents. They're loud, entertaining, and so incredibly
sweet. They've welcomed me with open arms, which is more than I could
ever ask for.
And really, it's not been hard for Rhodes and me to act like we're
married. We've just continued the same routine we've had for the past
month.
It's almost as if we actually are husband and wife.
“Ryan! Harper!”
I turn toward the voice calling to me and let out a squeal when I see
who it is. We rise from our seats and meet our friend Denver halfway down
the row.
“Oh gosh, it's so good to see you! What are you doing here?” I ask,
hugging her.
“Shep is here schmoozing some people, so I tagged along to get out of
the house a bit to escape the chaos of my children.” She points up to the
suites. “I saw you two from up there and had to come say hi.”
Last year I sold some photographs to Denver and her husband, Shep,
who happens to be Collin and Rhodes' agent. Us ladies quickly hit it off,
and we've stayed connected since. As a gift, Shep gave me tickets to a
Comets game. It just happened to be the game where Collin and Harper
met.
And I guess where I met Rhodes for the first time too.
I still remember the way he looked at me through the glass after he and
Collin crashed into the boards, scaring the shit out of me and Harper. Our
eyes locked, and I was in awe. Sure, he had that same scowl he still wears
on his face, but it didn't stop me from finding him attractive.
I still do too.
“Anyway,” Denver says, “I, uh, heard about your…situation with
Rhodes.” She leans in close. “Don't worry, your secret is safe with me.”
“Did Rhodes tell you?”
She lifts her shoulders. “I mean, not officially, but Shep isn't completely
clueless. He was able to piece it together when you two went from being
nothing to married in a weekend.”
I cringe. “It's kind of embarrassing.”
“Don't be embarrassed. It happens. Honestly, if you ask me, it sounds
like something straight out of a romantic comedy. Who knows? Maybe
you'll fall in love for real!”
Love.
The word trips me up.
Sure, things have changed for us since we started sleeping together, but
love? No. That's not what this is. It's just two people in an impossible
situation making the most of it…right?
I force out a laugh, hoping no one catches on to how fake it sounds.
“Anyway,” Denver says, “I just wanted to come down and say hi to you
both. I better get back up there though before Shep wonders where I am and
goes looking in supply closets for me.” I lift my brows, and she waves it
off. “Nothing. Inside joke with us.” She hugs me again. “It was good seeing
you. We should get together for lunch soon.”
“That sounds great,” I tell her.
“Definitely,” Harper agrees.
We make plans to meet up the following week, and she takes off back
up the stairs. Luckily, before Harper can make any comments about what
Denver said, Maggie and Oscar return. I ignore the hole she's staring into
the side of my head as the third period kicks off.
Before I know it, I'm engrossed in the game, forgetting all about
Denver's silly fantasy. The Comets take two more penalties—I'm starting to
think Maggie was onto something there—and unfortunately, the other team
capitalizes on one.
It's down to just three minutes on the clock, and it's tied 3–3. The
atmosphere in the arena is tense, everyone hoping the reigning Stanley Cup
champions can somehow push ahead and win their first game of the season.
Rhodes is out on the ice. He's holding the puck behind the net, waiting
for his team to make a line change. The moment Collin's skates hit the ice,
Rhodes takes off. He passes the puck over to Collin, who shoots it back to
him.
They drive into the zone and set up the play, playing hot potato with the
puck, looking for a way to get it to the net. They're trying to wear the other
team down, confuse them. And when Collin fakes the shot, then passes to
Rhodes, it works.
He fires a wrister at the net and it sails over the blocker side of the
goalie, just like Oscar said they needed to do. The lamp lights up red and
the place goes wild, everyone jumping out of their seats cheering—me
included.
“BEEEAAASSSTTT!” we all cheer in unison, high-fiving and hugging
strangers like we've known each other forever. It's exhilarating.
After it's over, Rhodes is named the first star of the game and takes a
quick interview with the announcer. He looks so uncomfortable during the
whole thing, and I know it's because he hates the attention.
The place begins to clear out, and we leave too. We have plans to meet
Rhodes and Collin at Slapshots, a local hockey bar, after they're done with
their postgame stuff. I guess this is a tradition the guys have.
It doesn't take us long to walk to the bar. Despite the place being crazily
packed, we grab a table in the back and order some appetizers and drinks.
Oscar and Maggie are chatting with a few other hockey parents—people
they know from attending games over the years—and Harper is deep in
discussion with another player's girlfriend about some movie that came out
recently.
I don't know how long passes until two arms slip around my waist.
I know instantly it's Rhodes.
“What are you doing out here?” I ask, turning in his arms, looping my
arms around his neck. “I figured it would be a while still.”
“I always slip out early. Besides, Coach already gave us a speech, and
there's no way I'm doing any interviews.”
“Not even as the first star of the game?” I grin at him. “You played
great, by the way. I'm proud of you.”
“Yeah?” He tugs me closer, smiling down at me. “How great we talking
here? On a scale of one to I get to see your titties tonight.”
“I'd say the chances of it being a titties night are excellent.”
“Excellent, huh? Damn, I should have aimed higher. Maybe gone for—”
“If you're even thinking about bringing up what I think you're thinking
about, it's a no. Exit only for now.”
His smile grows. “For now, huh? Noted.”
“God, you're annoying.” I try to push from his hold, but he doesn't
budge. Instead, he heaves me closer.
“You like it.”
“Do not.”
He slips his hands into my hair, tilting my head back so I'm looking up
at him. “Do too…wife.”
Then, he kisses me, and that damn four-letter word filters through my
mind for the second time tonight.
Love.
Only this time, it doesn't trip me up nearly as much, and I don't know
how to feel about that.
“Don't forget, I like my wieners—”
“Long and thick? Oh, I am well aware, Maggs.” Oscar bounces his
brows up and down at his wife.
“Well, yes.” Maggie blushes. “But you know I meant well done, Oscar.”
She slaps at him playfully.
I glance over at Rhodes, who looks like he's about to vomit.
“I think your father is talking about his dick.”
Rhodes glares at me. “Shut—and I mean this respectfully—the fuck
up.”
I laugh. “Oh, lighten up. Your parents have seen each other's naughty
bits. They've even had sex, Rhodes.”
“I want a divorce.”
I lift a brow. “Really, now?” I hold my left hand up and pinch my thumb
and forefinger around my wedding band, tugging it up. “Because I'll—”
He points the tongs he's holding at me. “Don't you fucking dare take
that off.”
A shiver runs through me at the low growl in his words.
I've come to learn that Rhodes really likes the look of a ring on my
finger, and I have to admit, seeing him all riled up about it does something
to me I can't explain.
It makes me feel good, desired…and confused.
I push that part away.
“I'm going to go check on the macaroni. Try not to let visions of
humping and grinding and your par—”
“Ryan Bell!”
I cackle at the way his face reddens, then quickly slam the back door
closed as he charges at me.
The door slides open shortly after, Maggie following me into the
kitchen.
“Would you like some help?” she asks as I pull open the oven to check
on the food. “I'm great in the kitchen.”
“Sure. Can you grab the toppings from the fridge and get them settled
on the platter? The macaroni is nearly finished. Just need to let it broil a bit
longer.”
“Of course.”
She busies herself gathering the toppings from the fridge and arranging
them like they're being photographed for some fancy food magazine.
I stop in front of the kitchen sink to wash my hands so I can help, when
from the corner of my eye I catch Rhodes outside.
His head is thrown back in a laugh over something his father said, and
he looks so…free. I've noticed that about him recently. How his smiles are
coming easier, and his shoulders aren't as weighed down by that invisible
weight he seems to carry. I've even noticed that he full-on laughs at least
twice a day now. A feat for him, really.
It's…beautiful. He's beautiful.
And right now, in this moment, with the sunlight hitting just behind
him, he looks picturesque.
My hands ache for the weight of my camera to catch this moment.
“The way you look at him…” Maggie's words draw my attention.
“It's…well, it reminds me of Oscar and myself.”
A twinge of guilt hits me, her comparing our fake marriage to their very
real one.
“It does?”
“Yes. The way you love him is clear as day, and I have to say… I'm so
happy. I'm so happy because I was so worried he wouldn't ever find this
kind of love. Not because he doesn't deserve it or because of that damn scar
that changed his life. But because I was scared he wouldn't allow himself to
be loved like this. With you, I don't have that worry. He's finally back to…
well, himself.”
I wasn't expecting her to say that. And I really wasn't expecting the
burn at the back of my throat.
I swallow, trying to find words. Any words.
But nothing comes.
She rests her hand on my forearm as I blink back the tears stinging my
eyes. “I'm so glad you've found each other, Ryan. You're good for him, and
something tells me he's good for you too.”
Something tells me…she's right.

RYAN & RHODES
Ryan: Please don't be mad at me.
Rhodes: Absolutely nothing good ever follows that.
Ryan: I need you to promise.
Rhodes: No.
Ryan: No you won't be mad or no you're not going to
promise?
Rhodes: Just no. Whatever it is, no.
Rhodes: Okay, fine. Tell me. I'm curious.
Ryan: Well now I DON'T want to tell you because you're
going to be mad.
Rhodes: Just tell me.
Ryan: Nah.
Rhodes: Ryan…
Rhodes: Tell me.
Ryan: Or?
Rhodes: Or?
Rhodes: What do you mean OR?
Ryan: Tell you OR what? What are you going to do if I don't
tell you?
Ryan: Fly here?
Rhodes: YES. And spank you.
Rhodes: Except not in a fun way this time.
Ryan: It's always a fun way. *smirk emoji*
Rhodes: Have I…unlocked a hidden kink?
Ryan: I'm not sure. We may have to test it more.
Rhodes: *warms palm up*
Rhodes: WAIT.
Rhodes: No.
Rhodes: Tell me what you were going to tell me.
Ryan: Nah.
Rhodes: Yes.
Ryan: No.
Rhodes: Don't make me book a flight.
Ryan: You wouldn't.
Rhodes: You're right. I'll just worry the whole night and play
an awful game and that will be on YOUR shoulders.
Ryan: Wow. So that's how you're going to play it, huh?
Rhodes: Exactly like that.
Rhodes: Ryan?
Rhodes: RYAN?
Rhodes: Fine. But if I lose tonight, know it's your fault.
Ryan: Okay, wow. That's just mean.
Ryan: Poe puked in your bed.
Rhodes: Oh. Is that it?
Ryan: And your closet.
Rhodes: Oh.
Ryan: And in your shoes.
Rhodes: Which ones???
Ryan: And maybe on your couch too.
Rhodes: WTF
Rhodes: Okay, okay. It's fine. No biggie.
Rhodes: What's wrong with her?
Ryan: I took her to the vet and apparently she's eating too
fast. I think she's scared Frodo is going to eat all her food, so
she's gobbling it down.
Rhodes: But they're getting along so well.
Ryan: I know. But cats are weird.
Rhodes: Well, her throwing up on everything is fine. I'm not
mad.
Ryan: So then you won't be mad if I also tell you I spilled red
wine on the couch?
Rhodes: …
Rhodes: You're going to be the death of me.
Ryan: Am not. I'm cute.
Rhodes: And a pain in my ass.
Rhodes: I need to get ready.
Ryan: GO TEAM GO!
Rhodes: Death of me.
Ryan: You were so close on that goal! That ping off the
crossbar was LOUD!
Ryan: Ugh. Fuck New York. That hit was bullshit. Totally dirty.
Ryan: Oh my god. You have to be kidding me?! They called
THAT a trip??
Ryan: HOLY SHIT YOU SCORED!!
Ryan: Great. Now I'm wet.
Ryan: Ugh. Why does hockey make me so horny???
Ryan: Hmmm…maybe I should have gotten a new sex toy.
Rhodes: Okay, wow. We need to lay down a few ground rules.
Rhodes: #1: You CANNOT tell me you're horny and wet when
I'm hundreds of miles away. Well, you can, but only when I'm
able to FaceTime you or something so we can take care of it
together.
Rhodes: #2: If you're getting new toys, I want to help pick
them out. That way when you're using them, you'll think of
me.
Ryan: I'd think of you anyway.
Rhodes: Hm. If I didn't know any better, I'd say you're starting
to like me.
Ryan: Your dick. I'm starting to like your dick.
Rhodes: It is a great dick.
Ryan: Yeah? I heard it was a burden. Too big to carry around.
Rhodes: Just the cross I have to bear.
Ryan: You're exhausting.
Ryan: Good game tonight, btw. You did amazing.
Rhodes: Thank you.
Rhodes: I…I like it when you watch my games.
Ryan: Yeah? Guess I'll have to keep watching then.
Rhodes: You're only saying that because they make you
horny.
Rhodes: Wait. Are you still horny? Did you…take care of
yourself during the game?
Ryan: …
Rhodes: Oh fuck. You did, didn't you?
Ryan: *zips lips*
Rhodes: Holy hell. I'll be at the hotel in ten minutes. You'd
better answer my call.
Ryan: Sorry tonight didn't go good for you guys.
Rhodes: It happens. Had to break the winning streak at some
point.
Ryan: *picture*
Ryan: This should make you feel better. They've been curled
up like that together for the last hour.
Rhodes: That does make me feel a little better.
Ryan: I'm still surprised they're getting along so well. Poe is a
moody bitch half the time. Harper thinks it's funny because
Poe is grumpy and I'm not, and you're grumpy and Frodo is
the sweetest thing in the world. She thinks we adopted the
wrong pets.
Rhodes: Harper may be onto something.
Ryan: I'm not telling her that. She'll gloat too much.
Ryan: She says hi, btw.
Rhodes: Is she there?
Ryan: Yes. That's okay, right?
Rhodes: Of course. It's your place too.
Ryan: Does that mean I can hang some photos around here?
I was teasing about the castle thing, but I'm starting to
suspect I was right…
Rhodes: Go for it.
Ryan: Really???
Rhodes: Were you expecting a different answer?
Ryan: Honestly, yes.
Ryan: But I'm not about to look a gift horse in the mouth.
Rhodes: I do have a stipulation.
Ryan: Naturally.
Rhodes: It has to be your photos.
Ryan: I think I can manage that.
Rhodes: The bus to the hotel is leaving soon. Call you when I
get there?
Ryan: Yes.
Rhodes: You should probably tell Harper to leave.
Ryan: Why?
Rhodes: Because I want to see you.
Ryan: Okay…
Rhodes: All of you.
Ryan: Oh. OH.
Ryan: Consider it done.
Rhodes: And Ryan?
Ryan: Yes?
Rhodes: That new toy you got?
Rhodes: Have it ready.
Ryan: *picture*
Ryan: Grams loves her jersey! She says thank you!
Rhodes: Anything to get her to stop wearing Collin's number.
Ryan: Oh, she still has that. It was under her pillow earlier
when I left.
Rhodes: I don't get it. He's not even that great.
Rhodes: I lied. He's the most amazing defenseman on the
team. Definitely the best.
Rhodes: Most handsome too.
Ryan: Hi Collin.
Rhodes: Hey Ryan. Your husband is a grump. You should
send him more pictures of
Rhodes: Okay, wow. Ignore him. He's an idiot.
Ryan: Now I'm curious what I need to send you more pictures
of.
Rhodes: Nothing.
Rhodes: Though I wouldn't complain about some sexy
photos…
Ryan: I am not sending you nudes.
Rhodes: I never said anything about being nude.
Rhodes: I'm kidding anyway. You don't need to send me
photos.
Ryan: *picture*
Rhodes: HOLY FUCK
Rhodes: Is that…? In my jersey??
Rhodes: You're seriously killing me right now. I still have to
catch a flight home.
Ryan: You should probably hurry up then.
Rhodes: Ryan?
Ryan: Yeah?
Rhodes: I expect you to be wearing that when I get home.
Ryan: Yes, husband.

RHODES
I can't remember a time when I was ever this eager to get a game over with.
We've been on the road for the last week, and all I want to do is crawl
into my bed and wrap my arms around Ryan for a week straight.
Obviously, that week-straight part won't happen, but still. I just want to
be at home.
It has nothing to do with hockey either. We're currently 9—2—1. We're
playing like the champions we are, and my numbers are looking damn
good. I've put up four goals and five assists. I've never started a season this
hot before. I feel good on the ice. My playing is at its all-time best. I feel
rested and relaxed, and I'm making good plays.
So why am I eager to get home and away from the game I love so
much?
Ryan.
The more time we spend together, the more I hate leaving her for these
road games, which is crazy to me. I love hockey. I've always loved hockey.
It's been my life for as long as I can remember. It's always been an escape,
and even more so after my accident. I was able to lose myself in the game
and ignore the rest.
But lately, I don't want to escape. I just want to spend time with Ryan.
I'll admit, when Collin and Harper started dating, I did my best to avoid
her. It pissed me off how easily she charmed everyone around her. It was
easy for her to command the attention of any group because of her beauty,
and frankly, it annoyed me.
But what I know now is I was missing all those special parts of her that
she keeps hidden under the surface. She's more than the bubbly, sunshiny
personality she puts out there. She's deep and thoughtful and just a touch
emotionally scarred from her parents leaving her. But she's also funny, and
smart, and caring. The way she gives everything up for the people she loves
most in her life blows me away.
She blows me away.
My phone buzzes on the bench next to me and I pick it up. I don't
typically spend time on my phone before games, but when I see Ryan's
name come across my screen, I can't help but snatch it.
And I'm glad I did.
Ryan: *picture*
Ryan: Good luck! We're rooting for you!!
She looks so fucking cute sitting there in my jersey, Poe and Frodo flanking
her on the couch.
She's been doing this every night I've been away, sending me little good
luck texts or congratulations afterward. Sometimes she'll even text me playby-plays as she sees them from a different angle.
It's cute as hell, and I look forward to them way more than I'd like to
admit.
“Dude, based on the way you're looking at that phone right now, I'd say
you just got a very nice picture from your lady,” Collin says, flopping down
on the bench next to me.
“You sound like Miller.”
Collin's face twists up. “Oh, fuck. I do. Gross.”
“Hey! I heard that,” Miller says, flipping us off.
“Sorry. I think I'm just horny.”
Now it's my turn to look disgusted. “I'd really rather not hear about
your dick problems, thank you.”
“I'm just saying, being away this long fucking blows. One more game
and I get to go home to my girl.”
“I hear you there.”
I know the moment I say it, I'm about to catch hell.
“Oh, you hear me, huh?”
I sigh. “Don't you have someone else to go bother?”
“And miss that annoyed scowl on your face? No, thanks.”
Said scowl deepens, and he laughs.
“I take it things are still going well?” I nod. “You two have been looking
awfully cozy lately.”
“Is that a bad thing?”
“No. Just…”
When he doesn't continue, I lift my hands. “Just what?”
“I don't know. Be careful, I guess.”
“Be careful?”
He nods. “Yeah. You know…because of the whole ‘faking it' thing.”
I glance around the room, but nobody is paying us any attention.
“There's nothing to worry about. We've drawn some pretty clear lines.”
He studies me. “Have you?”
“Yeah.”
“So you definitely have boundaries, then?”
“For sure.”
“And you're following them?”
“Mostly, yeah.”
“Mostly?”
“She has her own bedroom.”
He doesn't look impressed. “Does she sleep in there?”
I don't answer that, which is answer enough.
“See my point? You're already breaking all your rules, even the simple
ones. You have to keep things separate or else it's going to start feeling
real.”
I gulp.
Things already feel real.
“Oh. Okay. Wow. Disregard everything I just said.” He waves a hand in
front of my face. “It's clear as day I'm too late.”
“Huh?”
Collin's brows are near his hairline, and he's looking at me like I'm
stupid. “You're in love with her, dude.”
I scoff, rolling my eyes. “I am not.”
“You are. You really are.”
“I'm really not. I promise.”
“Uh-huh. So she's not the first thing you think about in the mornings?”
“Well, yeah, but only because she's usually stolen all the covers in the
middle of the night and I'm annoyed with her.”
“Hm. Okay. She's not the person you're most excited to see when you
get home from an away game?”
“Frodo is.”
“Right. And she's definitely not the one who has you acting like an
actual human for once and not walking around like you have a stick up your
ass?”
“She…” Well, okay. So I have been more…approachable lately. But
that's just because I've been getting laid regularly, I'm sure. “No. It's not
like that.”
Collin chuckles. “Right. Sure. Whatever you have to keep telling
yourself.”
“I'm not telling myself anything. It's true.”
“Okay.”
I scrub a hand down my face, my irritation growing. “Stop doing that.”
“Doing what?”
“Saying okay like that—like you don't believe me.”
“I'm not saying I don't believe you. I'm just saying you're full of shit.”
“Collin…”
“Rhodes…” he mocks. “Look, I'm just saying, would it really be such a
bad thing if you were in love with her? I mean, she is your wife after all.”
Would it be a bad thing if I were in love with Ryan? Yes, yes it would
be.
And that's because she's my wife but not my wife. We're married, but
only on paper. It's not like she's with me because she actually likes me. If
we hadn't gotten drunk married, we would have continued on ignoring one
another just like we were. There'd be no this right now.
So, can I be in love with her? No.
Collin pats me on the back, then pushes up off the bench. “Just be
careful,” he repeats. “And get those fucking skates on. We got a game to
win.”
The house is dark when I get home. I stop in the kitchen for a quick bottle
of water and then check to make sure Frodo and Poe are comfortable.
They're in their now usual position of being snuggled together in Frodo's
bed.
I step into the bedroom and marvel at the sight in front of me.
Ryan is curled up in the middle—because that's where she always
sleeps—and she has her arms wrapped around my pillow. The moonlight is
filtering over her, the light and shadows mixed to create a stunning image.
I'm not good with the camera, but I grab hers anyway and snap a quick
picture. It'll be a surprise for her when she wakes. I set the camera on the
bedside table and almost feel bad about having to crawl into bed with her
because she looks so peaceful.
But I can't not touch her right now.
I strip my clothes off, tossing them haphazardly across the room, and
climb into bed behind her. I wrap my arm around her waist, tugging her
close. There's no way she doesn't feel my hard cock against her bare ass.
I know it too because it doesn't take long before she's wiggling against
me, stirring awake. She tangles our fingers together, and I rub at her ring.
“Hey,” she mutters, her voice scratchy and full of sleep. “I tried waiting
up for you, but I passed out.” She rolls over in my arms, facing me. “That
was an intense game, but I'm glad you guys won.”
“I'm glad we did too.”
New York ended up scoring with just a minute left in the third period.
Overtime was fucking exhausting, and neither team could capitalize on it.
We finally won in the shootout with a wicked rocket from Miller. Fucking
rookie saved our asses again. He'll never let us live it down.
“I missed you,” I say to her, capturing her mouth for a kiss.
I fit my lips against hers and kiss her lazily, taking my time as our
tongues stroke together.
She grins against me when I finally pull away. “I missed you too.”
“Yeah?”
“On a scale of one to seeing my titties…” she says, pushing me onto my
back. She climbs on top of me, straddling me just like she did that first
morning. “It's a solid titties.”
She grabs the hem of her shirt, ready to strip it off, but I stop her.
“Wait.” Her brows scrunch together. “Leave it on.”
“On? But I thought…”
I tug her down, kissing her quickly. “I'd love to see your titties, baby
girl, but right now, what I'd love even more is to eat your pussy while you
sit on my face wearing my jersey.”
Her eyes gloss over at my words, and I know she wants that too.
I smack at her ass. “Get up there.”
She moves faster than I've ever seen her move before, fitting her knees
around my head.
“Hands on the headboard, Ryan.”
She tugs her bottom lip between her teeth and does what I say.
“Lower.”
“Huh?”
“Lower. Sit lower.”
“But…”
“I said sit, not hover.” I smack her ass again and she moans. “Lower.”
She obliges, lowering her pussy to my mouth.
She sighs the moment my tongue slides against her, her eyes rolling
back in her head. And I do as I promise. I tongue-fuck her cunt and suck her
clit into my mouth. I eat her, taking my time to get my fill so long that she
stops being worried about suffocating me and starts fucking herself on my
face.
I feel her trembling from the exhaustion of holding herself up, and I
know she's teetering closer and closer to the edge by the second.
I test my luck by sliding my finger through her wet folds, back to her
hole. She tenses when my finger brushes against her. I suck her clit into my
mouth again, playing with her until she relaxes against the touch.
“Rhodes…” She whimpers when I slip the tip of my finger in.
I keep my mouth on her, not letting up, and it's not long before she's
rocking against it, pushing my digit in deeper.
And it's not long after that until she's coming apart.
I withdraw my finger as her shakes subside, continuing to lap at her
until she comes down off her high. She scoots back down my body looking
satiated—but I'm not done with her yet.
I flip her onto her back, fitting myself between her legs and sliding into
her without hesitation.
“Ooohh,” she cries out, arching into me as I fuck into her slowly.
I cradle her face in my hands, kissing her, letting the strokes of my
tongue match what I'm doing between her legs.
It's a slow, agonizing dance and I want to fuck her harder and faster, but
I want to take my time too.
Her breaths begin coming in sharper, and I know another orgasm is
building.
“Rhodes…I need…”
She doesn't have to finish her sentence. I know her body by heart at this
point.
I push to my knees, keeping my slow, languid pace, and press my thumb
to her clit. She sighs at my touch, panting and pleading for a release.
Finally, she breaks, spasming around me, milking my own orgasm from
my body.
Exhausted, I collapse, rolling onto my back and taking her with me.
She's sprawled across me, her body limp and worn.
“So good. So, so good,” she murmurs, the words slurred with sleep.
It's not long before I hear the faint sounds of her snoring.
I don't know how long I lie there watching her, her head resting on my
chest, her features soft and sated.
But I do know she's perfect. This is perfect. Nothing in the world could
be better than this moment.
And that's what scares me the most.

RYAN
“Oh god. Oooooh. Fucking hell. Oh.”
“Um, can you please stop moaning like that? Pretty sure you're making
everyone uncomfortable right now.”
Collin points to his lap. “Especially my dick because these are new
jeans, and I haven't stretched them out properly yet so there's like nowhere
for my boner to go.”
“Collin!” Harper's eyes widen. “Good grief. What is wrong with you?”
“Me? What's wrong with you?! You're the one moaning over here like
you were last night when I—”
She slaps a hand over his mouth. “Do not finish that sentence.” She
gives him a warning look, then removes her hand. “Sorry. These donuts are
just seriously so good.”
It's true. These donuts are really good.
“I had no idea this place even existed. I feel like I've been missing out.”
I glance around the lot the adorable little baby blue food truck is in.
There are a few picnic tables spread around and a small coffee bar off to the
right of the truck. There is a line at least five people deep, and it's been
consistently busy since we got here.
How I didn't have a clue about this place, I don't know.
“You have been. It's seriously so good. I'm addicted.”
“Well, if someone”—I look pointedly at Rhodes—“would have told me
about it before, I could have been eating donuts every day.”
He holds his hands up innocently. “Hey, I tried bringing you before my
last home game, but no. You had a video to film and wouldn't let me in the
room for some reason.”
“Ugh. This again?” I roll my eyes. “Harper, will you please tell Rhodes
here I do not have to let him sit in on me making my makeup tutorials?”
“Oh, one hundred percent no. You do not have to allow him in there. I
don't allow Collin in my studio even though he asks me all the time.”
“Like all the fucking time, and she just won't let me in. I don't get it.”
“Because it's my studio. I don't ask you to go out on the hockey rink
and do hockey things, now do I? No, because that's your space.”
“I'll take you skating. I'll take you skating right fucking now. Get some
skates on. Let's go,” Collin says, rising from the bench we're currently
sitting on.
Harper grabs his jacket, pulling him back down. “Oh my god. Shut up,
sit down, and eat your damn donuts.”
I turn to Rhodes, satisfied with Harper's answer. “See, I told you it's not
weird that I won't let you watch.”
“Okay, now that sounds a little dirty. What kind of videos? I'd watch.”
Collin bounces his brows up and down. Harper smacks him in the back of
the head. “Wow. Geez, I was kidding.”
“Fine,” Rhodes says. “I get it. It's your space. It's your thing. I don't
need to be there all up in your business. But I do think it's pretty fucking
cool.”
“So cool. I had no idea so many steps and so much time and products
were involved. I can't believe the way people can transform their faces with
just makeup.” He turns to Harper. “Maybe you should do that, start doing
your makeup more often.”
Harper, who is completely engrossed in her donuts, does the slowest,
creepiest turn I've ever seen. Her eyes are dark and dangerous, and her
eyebrows are about up to her hairline as she looks to her boyfriend. “Excuse
me? Did you just tell me I need to wear more makeup?”
At first, Collin looks confused.
Then, it hits him, and he nearly jumps off the bench.
“What, no? No, no, no! I was just saying, you know, because she does
like fun, crazy, cool stuff. I thought you could do fun, crazy, cool stuff too,
but scary. Because you love scary and scary things make you happy and I
love when you're happy and definitely don't want to murder me.”
He's talking a mile a minute trying to correct his mistake, but it's no
use. Harper's already off the bench and ready to pounce.
I have to give Collin credit. He is a lot smarter than I thought because
he takes off at a dead sprint, running from his girlfriend who is now chasing
after him.
Rhodes and I fall into a fit of laughter watching Harper trying to catch
up to him.
“Well, he really botched that one, didn't he?”
“Afraid so,” Rhodes says. “And to think he was going to propose to her
today.”
I gasp. “Was he really?”
“Oh fuck.” Rhodes drops his head into his hands. “I wasn't supposed to
say anything. But, yeah, he's planning to propose.”
“How? What does he—” I gasp again. “Wait…he asked me for the
footage from my exhibit and Harper said something about them going out
to some old horror movie at that ancient theater downtown tonight. Is he
doing it there?”
“He is. I have no idea on the specifics, but he has this whole thing
planned.”
“Is the ring pretty?”
“Very. I'm actually surprised he didn't go to you about it.”
“Me too. I have great taste. But I totally would have slipped and told
Harper, so it's probably a good thing he didn't. I'm awful at keeping
secrets.”
“You're keeping our secret pretty well.”
“Yeah, but this is easy.”
A look crosses his face that I can't quite decipher, but it doesn't
necessarily make me feel bad. His mouth drops open like he's going to say
something, but he thinks better of it, snapping it shut and shaking his head.
“What?” I ask.
“It's nothing. I just—”
Harper flops down on the bench across from us, interrupting whatever
he was going to say with her harsh breaths.
Rhodes looks away, clearing his throat. “Did you lose him?”
“Nope, he's up a tree.”
“A tree.”
“Yep. The coward literally climbed a tree to avoid my wrath.”
“Oh god.” Rhodes groans and stands up. “I'll go get him down.” He
ambles away in search of his friend.
“Did I just interrupt something? It looked like whatever you two were
talking about was pretty intense.”
I wave her off. “Nah. I'm sure it was nothing.”
Except it didn't feel like nothing.
It felt like something. Something big.
“Okay, puh-lease tell me I'm seeing what I think I'm seeing right now.”
A woman stands at the end of the table looking at the opposite side of
the parking lot where Rhodes is trying to coax Collin out of the tree.
“Unfortunately, that is exactly what it looks like,” Harper confirms for
her.
“I…wow. And to think, those are professional athletes.”
“Underneath all that hockey player bravado, they're boys. And we all
know—”
“Boys are dumb,” we all three say at the same time.
We burst into giggles.
The woman takes a seat next to Harper, then sticks her hand out to me.
“I don't think we've met yet. I'm Scout, the owner and resident baker.”
“You're the brilliant woman behind these amazing donuts?”
She nods as I slide my hand into hers. “The one and only.”
“I'm Ryan, Rhodes' wife.”
“Oh, I'm aware. Those headlines were…wow. I don't know how you do
it. I'd die being in the spotlight like that.” She shudders. “But
congratulations on the marriage. You two look so happy and in love.”
Harper and I exchange a look, trying to hold back our laughter.
“Thank you. It was a whirlwind romance, that's for sure.”
Scout sighs dreamily, dropping her chin into her hand. “Romance…that
sounds so nice. And so far out of reach.”
“Trust me, it is not all it's cracked up to be. Case in point”—Harper
points to where Rhodes is still trying to get Collin down—“that.”
Scout twists her lips up. “Point taken. I just wish…ugh, never mind.
Ignore me. Just the mindless ramblings of a woman who is perpetually
single and sad because she's an aspiring romance novelist who has never
been in love.”
“You write romance?” I perk up, excited because love.
“I dabble. A dream, really, you know?”
“I'd love to read what you have. I'm a huge sucker for all things
romance.”
“It's true. It's annoying.”
“Oh, pipe down over there. You can't be against love when you're in it.”
Harper grins, not looking the least bit sorry.
“What kind of romance novel?”
“It's an unrequited love story. Mostly because that's all I know.” She
shrugs. “Anyway, it's definitely not ready for reading, but maybe once I get
it finished?”
“Yes!”
“Will there be bloody, gruesome murders or scary serial killers in it?”
Harper asks.
“No.”
“Boo. Then count me out.”
Scout laughs, rising from the table and brushing the backs of her pants
off. “All right, well, back to work. I just had to come over and say hi and
introduce myself.” She turns to Harper. “As always, so good to see you.”
“Now that we've initiated Ryan into our little secret donut club, we'll
have to stop by more often.”
“Please do.” Scout beams at me. “Congratulations again on the recent
nuptials. The way he looks at you is…well, it's what romance novels are
based on.” She backs away with a wave and a smile.
“I like her. She seems sweet,” I say to Harper once we're alone again.
“Very sweet and shy. She seems to be doing an amazing job with this
place. It's been packed every time I've been here.”
“Impressive.”
Harper nods. “So, speaking of cute together…how are things with you
and Rhodes? Is everything still going okay?”
“Yeah, actually. Everything is…well, really great.”
And it's the truth. Things have been going so well lately. Scary well.
And not just things with Rhodes and me either.
My grams is happy and thriving at her new assisted living facility. She
loves her suitemate and all the nurses. She's taking part in more group
activities than she ever did before.
My YouTube channel has grown by twenty thousand subscribers in the
last month, which means more views, which in turn means more profit. I'm
not dumb—I know a lot of that has to do with marrying Rhodes and people
being curious about our relationship, but I'm not about to look a gift horse
in the mouth.
I've kept true to his request to not post about us, but Poe and Frodo
have become fixtures on my Instagram page.
“Good, I'm glad. I won't lie, I was a little worried about you two.”
“Worried?”
“Yeah. I mean, you're just so different. He's like this total reclusive
grump and you're always the life of the party. I wasn't sure how that would
work out. But now…” She trails off and then shrugs. “I don't know. This
might be way off base and totally crazy, but Scout was right—he does look
at you like something straight out of a book. It almost seems like you guys
aren't pretending anymore.”
My initial instinct is to refute her claims because that's not true. Of
course we're still pretending.
But…
“I…I'm not so sure I am pretending anymore.”
“Are you saying…”
“I think I'm in love with my fake husband.”
I take a step back, admiring my work hanging on the gallery wall.
Somehow, and I have no idea how I got so lucky, Rhodes gave me
permission to use some shots from our session together.
I was nervous to approach him about it and fully expected him to tell
me no, but he didn't. In fact, he called it my best work to date and
encouraged it.
I've been teasing him about being a “model” ever since.
“It's breathtaking.”
I glance over at the gentleman standing next to me. He's older than me
by several years, wearing a button-up long-sleeve shirt that's rolled to his
elbows and a pair of dark gray slacks. Tattoos cover his forearms, making
him look younger.
He's handsome…and totally married.
A blush steals up my cheeks at his compliment. “Thank you.”
“The raw emotion you captured is just…wow.” He gives his head a
small shake, eyes wide with amazement as he stares up at the photo. “That's
Adrian Rhodes from the Carolina Comets, right?”
“It is. Are you a Comets fan?”
“Huge. I don't make it out to as many games as I like, but I never miss
one on TV.” He pulls his hand from his pocket and sticks it out to me. “I'm
Winston Daniels. By the way, big fan of your work.”
“Of my…photography?” I ask, shaking his hand.
“Yeah. You sound surprised by that though.”
I shrug. “Sorry, I just always assume if people know me, it's from
my—”
“Makeup tutorials? My twin sister, Wren, is a big fan of that work of
yours.”
“Oh.” I laugh. “Thank you. Are you a photographer too?”
“I am. I mostly specialize in weddings and family portraits, but
whenever I can, I get out and grab some nature shots too.”
“Oh!” Recognition dawns on me. “You're that Winston Daniels. I saw
your photo of the wave that went viral, and I went down a rabbit hole of
your work. It's amazing, the way you can capture nature like that.”
He nods toward the photograph we're standing in front of. “Same could
be said for the way you capture emotion. I swear, I can feel his pain just by
looking at this photo.”
“It was an intense session, that's for sure.” I try my damnedest not to
blush remembering what happened at the end of said session. “What brings
you out here tonight?”
The gallery I hold my exhibits in downtown is having a showing tonight
for local artists. Rhodes is currently on a long stretch of away games, and
Harper is visiting her mother and sister on the other side of the state to
celebrate her engagement. Collin did propose, and I am over the moon for
them.
“My wife and I are here celebrating our anniversary. She's around here
somewhere. She's not really big into photography, so I'm sure she's back
there hanging out in the corner where all the nude portraits are.”
“Hey, I've seen some of those. Not a bad corner to be in.”
He laughs. “Well, I don't want to take up any more of your time. I just
wanted to say, photographer to photographer, your work is amazing.”
I blush again. “Thank you. I truly do appreciate the compliment.”
“And please, tell your husband good luck in his game tomorrow night. I
can't believe I'm about to say this, but I would love to see the Comets
whoop some St. Louis ass tomorrow.”
“I will definitely pass on the message. It was great to meet you,
Winston.”
“Likewise, Ryan.”
With a small wave, he disappears into the crowd.
I turn back to the photo of my husband. Longing pulls at my chest.
I miss him. So much more than I thought I would.
I didn't realize how lonely it could be to be the wife of a pro hockey
player. They're gone all the time, and when they are home, they spend a lot
of time at the rink practicing and the games go late into the night.
It's tough, and I don't think I ever gave Harper enough credit for having
to deal with this all the time.
“I'm surprised he allowed you to put that ugly thing on display.”
I am so taken aback by the words that it takes me a moment to realize
the person who said them is speaking to me.
I turn to my left, and I don't even have to ask who the woman standing
there is because I already know.
She huffs, flipping her hair over her shoulder. “God, look at him crying.
What a baby. Oh, boohoo, poor me I have a scar on my face; everybody feel
bad for me. Please, he's like a gazillionaire. How can you be sad when you
have money?”
My blood boils at her words, and I have to work overtime to keep my
cool.
Don't hit her, don't hit her, don't hit her. She's not worth it. Do not hit
her.
I have never punched somebody in my life, but I really want to fucking
hit her.
“What are you doing here, Brittney?”
“Oh, so you know who I am. Guess that means Rhodes talks about me,
huh?”
“No. Actually, he hasn't mentioned you. The subject of trolls doesn't
really come up all that often.”
She narrows her eyes at me, her face pinched tight. “Right. Sure.”
“I'll ask you again, what are you doing here? You have no business
being here.”
“I just had to see for myself if the rumors were true and Adrian actually
is married to some little wannabe social media star. With the lack of photos
on your Instagram, I was beginning to think it was all a publicity stunt.”
I give her a tight-lipped smile. “Nope. We are definitely married. But
thanks for being a follower.”
She glances down at the simple gold wedding band I have around my
finger, seeming rather unimpressed by it. “Right, and you expect me to
believe Adrian Rhodes bought you that wedding ring? I doubt that.”
“Doubt it all you want, but we have the marriage certificate to prove it.”
That's not actually true. I haven't yet seen a copy of the certificate.
But I know it's real. I was there.
I don't need to prove my marriage to anyone, let alone the woman who
stomped on Rhodes' heart.
“You know, I—”
I hold my hand up, stopping her. “Save it. I don't care what you have to
say about anything. I have no idea what your real motive is for being here,
but I don't have the patience to deal with your ass.”
She snaps her mouth shut, her fists balling at her sides. “You bitch.”
I snort. “Trust me, I've been called worse.” I take a step toward her, not
missing the way she flinches. “Just to set the record straight”—I point at the
photo of Rhodes—“there is nothing ugly about that man—my husband—
and you were goddamn lucky to have him for the time you did. But that's
over and done, and so are you. I'm going to give you one last chance to
walk out of here before I drag you into the street like the trash you are.”
She stands there, eyes wide, stunned.
And frankly, I'm stunned too, but mostly because I mean the words.
She pushes her tits out, shoving her shoulders back. “Fine, I'm leaving.
But this isn't over.”
“Oh, but it is.”
And I walk away from her barely holding it together.

RHODES
I am fuming.
It's been a few days since Ryan told me about the incident with Brittney,
and I'm still pissed about it. I immediately tried to call her, but even though
she's been calling me nonstop since Vegas, she didn't answer. I tried Colter
too, and like the coward he is, I got no response.
I think the part that pisses me off the most is that I couldn't be there to
protect her from Brittney's bullshit.
“Dude, you good?” Collin asks from the stationary bike next to me.
“You look like you're pushing it way harder than normal.”
“I'm fine.” But the words don't even sound fine to my ears.
“Everything good with you and Ryan?”
“No. Well, yes. But no.”
“Okay, totally not confusing at all.”
I slow my pedaling down. I'm an idiot. Yeah, I'm pissed the fuck off,
but I don't need to punish my body for it. Especially not when we have a
game tonight and I need the rest.
I'm just so fucking worked up that I need to release some of this pentup energy.
“Sorry, man,” I say, wiping the sweat off my forehead. “There was an
incident with Brittney while we were in San Jose.”
“What?” He slows his own bike down. “What the hell happened?”
“I don't know. I guess Brittney accosted Ryan when she was at the
gallery downtown. Came in talking about how she wanted to make sure we
were actually married or some shit. Who fucking knows? She's clearly off
her rocker.”
“Dude, she's always been off her rocker. The way she's played you with
that back-and-forth game…she's got issues, man.”
“I know. I know I should have listened to you. I know that now. Maybe
if I had, I wouldn't be in this situation right now.”
“Yeah, but maybe the situation isn't so bad anymore. I mean with you
being madly in love with your wife and all.”
He looks surprised when I don't start immediately refuting his claim.
“What? Not going to try to tell me otherwise?”
I shrug. “I don't know. Getting kind of tired of trying to convince
myself it's not true.”
He grins. “Fucking knew it. You're in looooove.”
“Shut up,” I grumble, but there's no bite behind it.
“You hear that, boys?” Collin shouts loudly. “Our boy is in love!”
“Yeah, no fucking shit. He's married,” Miller says back.
“About damn time,” Lowell mutters.
Collin pats me on the back, and I shrug his hand off. “Stop making it
weird, dude. It's not that big of a deal.”
“Not that big of a deal? You're known for being emotionally
unavailable. This is a huge deal.”
I guess he's right. I am pretty emotionally closed off most of the time.
But it's kind of hard not to be when you're me. Shit, look at what happened
with Brittney. I took a chance with a girl and made myself vulnerable for
the first time in a long time, and where did it get me? I got my heart
stomped on.
I realize now what I had with her wasn't love, and I know that because
whatever I felt for her pales in comparison to what I feel for Ryan.
With Ryan, it's this carnal need for her all the time, and not just in a
sexual way. I miss her constantly, sometimes even when she's sitting right
next to me. All I want to do is be around her and be with her. I want to
celebrate her milestones and her good news, and I want to experience all
her downs too.
I never had that with Brittney. Hell, there were some days I couldn't
even stand to be around her. But I settled. I settled because I thought that
was all I deserved.
I was so fucking wrong.
Collin hops off the stationary bike, grabbing a towel and wiping his face
off. “I'm happy for you, man. Look at us couple of saps in love. Who would
have thought?”
Not me, that's for damn sure.
“I'm going to hit the showers and then get home to grab a nap before
the game. And by nap, I mean I'm probably going to snuggle with Harper
and the dogs on the couch. Can you believe that woman doesn't like naps?
Who doesn't nap? Psychos, that's who.”
Definitely psychos. “I'm going to do a few more miles and then head
home myself. I'll catch you at the game tonight.”
“All right, man. Sounds good.” We bump our knuckles together and he
disappears out the door.
I keep going, pushing myself for another three miles. By the time I'm
finished, Lowell and Miller have already gone home too, and it's just me
left.
I hit the showers, enjoying the hot water beating down on my back. I
didn't realize just how stressed I was until now, feeling all the knots coming
loose in my muscles. This is exactly what I need too. Don't want to be too
keyed up before the game tonight.
When I get back to the lockers, my phone is buzzing against the bench.
I look at it, hoping it's either Brittney or Colter calling me back.
No luck. Just another one of those damn spam calls I'm getting real sick
of. Whatever the fuck they're selling, I don't want it.
This time I'm just pissed off enough to answer.
“What?” I growl into the phone.
“Oh! You answered! We've been trying to reach you—”
“About my car's extended warranty? No, thanks.”
I pull the phone away from my ear, ready to hit the end call button, then
a few choice words catch my attention.
“—Vegas. There was a mistake and—”
I bring the phone back up to my ear. “Wait. What's going on? Start
over.”
The person sighs like they're exasperated by me. “My name is Debbie
and I'm with the Heart Song Chapel here in Las Vegas. We've been trying
to reach you for quite some time now about your marriage certificate.”
“What about it?”
“Here in Vegas, you have ten business days to file your marriage
certificate with the county registrar's office. If you fail to file your
certificate, your marriage is not legal.”
“Yes, but that was included in the package. You would file for us.”
“Correct, sir. However, when they went to file your certificate, they
noticed a discrepancy with the signature. Somebody signed as Daisy Duck.”
There must be a mistake. I remember the ceremony. I remember reciting
our vows, and I remember signing that document.
There's no way.
“Sir, are you still there?”
“I'm still here. What…what exactly does this all mean?”
“Your marriage…sir, you are not legally married.”
We lost.
It's not the first time we've lost this season and it won't be the last, but
tonight we lost for one reason and one reason only.
Me.
My head wasn't even kind of in the game. I couldn't concentrate for
shit. I let the puck just skate by me, I took bad penalties, and I skated like I
was playing peewee hockey all over again.
Tonight's loss is solely on my shoulders.
And it's all because I'm not married to my wife.
Well, not my wife, apparently.
I still can't believe it. How could they have let such a huge mistake slip
right through their fingers like that? How could we not know? How could
we not remember?
And more than that—why? Why did Ryan sign the certificate with a
fake name? Does that mean she knew all along we were making a massive
mistake? Does that mean even in her crazy drunken haze, she didn't want to
be married to me? Does that mean if I confront her with this truth, she'll
leave me?
I clutch my chest, rubbing at a spot just over my heart.
Coach comes charging into the room, hands on his hips. He's pissed and
disappointed. His eyes land right on me, and he shakes his head with
disgust.
That's okay. I'm disgusted with me too.
“Well, that was…something, and not something good, that's for damn
sure. I expect that the next time we're out on that ice, we all have our heads
in the game and we come out swinging. We got it?”
A round of affirmations goes around the room, but it's weak.
“I said, do we fucking got it?” Coach yells.
Everyone screams louder this time, me included, because I know that's
what he's waiting for.
“Good. Now hit the showers and get out of here. I'm tired of looking at
you.” He sends me one last pointed glare, then stomps out of the room.
I begin stripping my gear off as Collin slides up next to me.
“Yo, man, what the fuck was that out there? You were playing like dog
shit.”
“Not now, Col. I'm not in the mood.”
“Not in the mood? Not in the fucking mood? I don't give two shits if
you're in the mood or not. You let this entire fucking team down and I want
an explanation.”
“What's that famous NHL quote? It's always we, never I?”
He does not appreciate my sarcasm one bit, his features falling into a
mean scowl that could rival one of my own.
“I don't know what the fuck is up your ass, but whatever it is, you need
to pull it out. It's not just you out on that ice, you know. It's not like you to
be selfish like that.”
I squeeze my eyes shut because he's right. It's not like me. “Having a
bad night is all.”
“What's going on? Talk to me.”
“It's…” I shake my head. “It's Ryan.”
His face fills with concern immediately. “Is she okay? What happened?”
“She's fine. She… I…” I toss myself down onto the bench, cradling my
head in my hands.
Collin drops down beside me.
“Dude. What is going on? Did she finally realize you're ugly and leave
you?”
I don't even have the energy to laugh.
“It's fake.”
“It's fake?” He leans closer. “Your marriage?” he whispers. “Yeah, I
know. It's been fake, man.”
“No. It's really fake.”
“What? What do you mean? I'm not following.”
“She didn't sign it.”
“Didn't sign what?”
“The certificate. She didn't sign the certificate.”
His brows shoot up, finally beginning to understand. “That means…”
“We're not married. We were never married.”
“Oh fuck.”
Oh fuck indeed.
It's been three days since I found out about the marriage certificate, and I
still haven't told Ryan.
How exactly do you tell your fake wife she isn't really your fake wife at
all? And how do you tell her when what you really want is for her to be
your real wife?
I take a deep breath, hands shaking as I push open the front door.
Tonight. I'll tell her tonight.
“Hey!” She beams at me. “I thought for sure you'd be at least another
hour.”
She's standing in the kitchen wearing one of my shirts and a pair of
little sleep shorts. She's barefoot, and it's very obvious with the way her
nipples are pressing against the shirt that she's not wearing a bra.
She looks fucking gorgeous, and I can't help when I cross the kitchen
and sweep her into my arms, slanting my mouth over hers.
I kiss her hard. I kiss her deep.
I kiss her for all the times I'm not going to be able to kiss her anymore.
When I finally pull away, we're both gasping for air.
She peers up at me, her eyes glassy with lust. “Wow. What was that
for?”
“Missed you.”
“I missed you too. Is everything okay?”
“Yeah, everything is great.”
“Are you sure?” She studies me closely. Too fucking closely.
“Actually, no. Everything isn't fine.”
I turn her away from me, pressing her against the counter, grinding my
hard cock against her ass. I gather her long hair into my fists, tugging on it
not so lightly.
A small moan escapes her, her head lolling back, enjoying the bite of
pain she's no doubt feeling.
“W-What's wrong?”
It's on the tip of my tongue to tell her the truth.
I should tell her the truth.
I want to tell her the truth.
I want to tell her I love her. Tell her I can't imagine a day of my life
without her in it and I want this to be real more than anything I've ever
wanted before.
But I don't say any of that.
Instead, I say, “You're wearing too many clothes.”
Then, I lift her shirt and push her shorts down her legs. I strip her
underwear from her body and bend her over the counter. I fist her hair and
grab her hips and I fuck her hard.
Raw.
Rough.
I slide into her pussy over and over again as the sounds of her moans
and our skin slapping together fill the quiet kitchen.
And I pretend she's mine just one last time.

RYAN
Something is off with Rhodes.
I could tell when he came home. There was just something in his eyes
that didn't seem right to me.
I don't know what it is either. He wouldn't talk after he fucked me
against the kitchen counter. Instead, he took me back to the bedroom and
did it all over again.
Something was going on. I could feel it.
But instead of forcing him to talk, I let him take what he needed,
thinking maybe in the morning, things would be different.
I was wrong, because that was two days ago and nothing has changed.
Something is off, and I want so badly to know what it is. I've already
decided that tonight when he comes home from his game, I'm confronting
him.
My phone buzzes against the desk with my reminder that I have about
five minutes to finish prepping for my live video.
In an effort to grow my YouTube channel and get my views up, I've
been doing live makeup tutorials. At first, I was really nervous because it's
awkward being in front of the camera on a good day, but being live in front
of the camera? Downright terrifying. If I mess up, everybody is there to see
it. If I say the wrong thing, everybody can hear it. It's a huge risk to take.
But sometimes you have to play the algorithm game, and right now, I'm
playing it.
And it's working.
Thanks to all my newfound followers and views, I've been able to
double my income over the last two months. If I keep this up, I'll be right
on track to get my student loans paid off when our one-year agreement is
up.
My chest pinches with discomfort.
I don't want to think about that. I don't want to think about how I'm
going to have to walk away from the man I'm in love with.
My timer goes off with a thirty-second warning, and I sit down in my
chair in front of my setup. I stretch my neck a few times to get rid of the
tightness forming from my nerves. I check my teeth in the mirror, then paste
on my brightest smile just as the feed goes live.
“Hey, you beauty babes!” I wave at the camera. “I'm so glad you're
able to join me today. I can see we already have…oh wow, there are five
hundred of you here. That's…oh! It just jumped. Wow. Twelve hundred
already? Holy…oh my gosh, there are five thousand of you! This is crazy!
This is the most viewers I've ever had at once. Thank you so much.”
I smile at the camera, but behind the scenes, my heart is beating rapidly.
I have never had this many people on my live videos before.
I glance down to make sure I actually put on clothes just to make sure
I'm not naked and that's why everybody is running to watch the feed.
Nope, I'm definitely dressed.
The views climb. And climb. And climb. Before I know it, I'm sitting at
250,000 people watching.
I'm shocked. I'm overwhelmed.
“Wow,” I say nervously to the camera. “This is…wow! Your girl is a
little nervous over here, not going to lie.” I chuckle, hoping it doesn't sound
as fake as it feels. “Okay, let's just dive into it, huh? For today's look, I am
going with something a little fun, a little funky. I was thinking about turning
myself into Alice from Alice in Wonderland. What do you think? That
sound good?”
My phone vibrates loudly against my desk, pulling my attention.
“Oh, sorry about that. Let me just turn that off really quick.”
I pick it up and see Harper's name flashing across my screen. I hit
ignore on the call, but before I can even set my phone down, texts start
coming through.
Harper: CALL ME!!!
Harper: NOW!
Harper: Do not read the comments. Call me. Please.
I have literally never clicked on comments so fast in my life.
And I regret it immediately.
Hundreds upon hundreds spill onto the page. They're coming in so fast I
can hardly keep up with them.
GirlyGirl18: Is it true?
BathAndBeautyWorks: My god. Shut up. No way.
User256468: You're not married???
BombBabe: Oh my god, what a psycho lying to us about being married.
MakeupMaddy: Liar, liar, liar.
Hockeyluvr2: OMG, I just feel so bad for Adrian Rhodes. Like, this chick
has been using his name and lying like crazy about being married to him.
Can you say crazy??? Poor Adrian!!
FckIt: Lying bitch.
BossyBabe3: What a slut.
User0585: Like seriously, how pathetic can you be?? Lying about being
married to somebody like WTF?
Liar. Not married.
What the hell is going on?
“So, um, I don't really know what's happening here. It seems like I'm
having some possible technical difficulties and…”
I fumble my way through the words, unable to take my eyes off the
comments that are still coming in.
Kickrocks4: WHORE!!!!!
URLUVRGIRL: Can you say D-E-S-P-E-R-A-T-E much?!
User835088: hahahaha how sad
PrincessPeaches8: Yeah I am totally unsubbing now. LAME.
KensBarbieGurl: Totally disappointed
RhodesLuvr: Guess this means my man is officially back on the market
then!
CometsFan96: GOOD RIDDANCE! Rhodes doesn't need distractions this
season. BACK 2 BACK BABY!
TheBeastsBelle: Sad sad SAD! But at least Rhodes is free now!
I don't know what to do. I don't know what to say.
So, I switch my computer off. Disconnect everything.
My heart is hammering so hard in my chest that I feel dizzy and it's a
struggle to drag air through my lungs.
I don't understand what's happening but the things they're saying…
They send a bad feeling through my gut. I clutch my stomach, suddenly
feeling nauseated.
My phone buzzes against the desk, scaring the shit out of me. I watch it
buzz, seeing that it's Rhodes calling me. I have never wanted to both
answer and ignore a call so badly in my life.
With shaky hands, I hit the green button and place the phone against my
ear. “H-Hello?”
“Oh, thank fuck. Listen, whatever you do, do not go online, okay?”
“Well, it's a little late for that. I was literally just on a live video, and I
started getting all these crazy comments.”
“Oh shit.”
“People were calling me a liar and a slut and saying all kinds of mean
things, untrue things.”
“Ryan…”
“They said we aren't married.”
Silence.
Complete and utter silence.
“Rhodes?” I ask tentatively. “Is it true? Are we not married?”
He sighs. And just with that sigh, I know.
“No, Ryan, we aren't married.”
After completely screwing up my life, I ended up in the same spot I was
trying to avoid.
On Harper's couch.
Okay, fine, so maybe it's not on her couch. I'm in her spare bedroom,
but it's still the same result.
A soft knock sounds on the door as it swings inward. Poe stands, ready
to protect me if need be, like the badass she is. I run my hand down her
back, calming her.
Harper pokes her head around the frame. “Hey, good morning.”
She says it like I'm a skittish little kitten about to run off.
“All right,” I say, holding my hand up. “Before you walk any farther
into this room, I need you to take the kid gloves off.”
Harper makes a show of pretending to peel gloves off her hands, then
rolls her sleeves up like she's ready to fight and continues into the room.
She settles in on the end of the bed and stares at me.
The longer she stares, the deeper she frowns, and the deeper she frowns,
the more annoyed I get.
I sigh. “Just say it. Whatever it is you're in here to say, just say it.”
“I don't have anything to say. I just wanted to see if you were doing
okay.”
“I'm fine, Harper. Totally fine. There's nothing to worry about.”
“Nothing to worry about? Ryan, your husband isn't your husband. You
married a guy in Vegas, decided to stay fake married to him for a year, fell
in love, and then found out the entire thing was a lie and you never got
married in the first place. What do you mean there's nothing to worry
about?”
Once she says it out loud like that, it sounds absolutely crazy. And, well,
it is kind of crazy.
I haven't spoken with Rhodes in days. I know it was probably immature
and completely unhelpful for me to run, but I needed space. Needed a fresh
environment to clear my head. Every time I looked around his house, I felt
like my lungs were going to give up.
I'm upset with him. Not because we're not married—because that
somehow just feels like a technicality at this point. No, I'm upset with him
because he knew we weren't married, and he hid it from me for days only
for me to have to find out on social media during a damn live video.
It was mortifying.
And the worst part is, I don't know what this means for us.
I need to talk to him—desperately so—but I'm not ready.
I need more time. I need to process. I need to think. I need to figure out
what the hell it is we are going to do.
I feel like I'm in Las Vegas all over again, stressing about what I'm
going to do with my life. Only this time, I don't feel hopeful about my
future. I just feel really, really sad.
And scared. I'm worried about my career that I've worked so hard for
blowing up in my face. I'm worried about paying for my grandmother's
care.
I'm worried about how I'm going to forgive the man I love for hiding
such a big thing from me.
“If it's any consolation,” Harper says, “Collin says he looks like shit.”
I laugh. “To be fair, Collin always says Rhodes looks like shit.”
“True,” Harper agrees. “Have you talked with him?”
“Not yet. But I will.”
“Good.” She nods. “That's good. I, uh, might have pulled a total you
and done some social media digging.”
“You did?”
“Yep, and I found the name and personal email of the person who
published the article about your marriage not being real.”
“And?”
“And I politely but firmly asked her who the hell tipped her off on this.”
“And?” I prompt again.
“You were right. That Brittney is a bitch.”
I fucking knew it.
Something deep in my gut knew things were off when she accosted me
at the gallery. There was something so strange about the way she was
phrasing things oddly, questioning my wedding ring, and stalking my social
media account so closely. It made me super uncomfortable. I know Rhodes
tried to talk with her and figure out what was going on, but he couldn't get
ahold of her. Now I know why. She was spending all her free time trying to
figure out whether or not Rhodes and I are actually married and then
plotting her revenge.
“I don't get it. She's the one who dumped him. Why would she care that
he got married or if his marriage is legit or not? She clearly didn't care
about him when she told him to take a hike.”
“Um, because bitches be crazy. That's why.” Harper says it like it's the
most obvious answer in the world.
“Yes, they do be crazy, but…” I shake my head. “You should have heard
the way she was talking about him when she saw the photo of him at the
gallery. She was so…mean. Just plain cruel.”
“Maybe she was jealous?”
“Of what? Me?”
“Uh, yeah, you're kind of a catch, Ryan.”
I wave my hand down my body. “Ah, yes, such a catch.” I admit it, it's
probably been three days since I've last showered. I've been wearing the
same pair of sweats for at least two of them, and I don't remember the last
time I changed my shirt. My hair is a greasy, tangled mess and my makeup
is from several days ago.
Simply put: I look like shit.
“Okay, well, maybe not like now now, but generally, you are a catch.”
I laugh. Leave it to Harper to make me feel better when I'm feeling my
worst.
She winks at me, then the mood in the room switches back to that
somberness that seems to be holding steady.
“What are you going to do?”
I lift my shoulders. “I don't know.”
“You love him, right?”
“So, so much. He's…everything I didn't know I wanted. He's so much
more than meets the eye. I love him more than I could have ever imagined.
But, Harper, what if he doesn't love me back? I mean, this whole thing was
a sham, a big ruse so he didn't get in trouble with his team. None of it is
real. Hell, he had to be drunk to get married to me in the first place. Before
that, we barely even spoke to each other. He mildly tolerated me on the best
of days. I…I don't know what I'm going to do if he doesn't love me back.”
The frown that seems to be permanently etched into her face deepens.
She reaches over, placing her hand on mine. “If he doesn't love you back,
he's a fool, and I watch a lot of horror movies. I have some great ideas on
how to get away with murder and destroy bodies and evidence like this.”
She snaps her fingers for emphasis.
I laugh. “That's not terrifying at all. Remind me not to piss you off.”
“I'm just saying.” She shrugs. “But seriously, Ryan, if Rhodes is too
dumb to see that you're the best thing that's ever happened to him, he
doesn't deserve you. If you ask me, though, I don't think him not loving
you is something you're going to have to worry about. I see the way he
looks at you, and it's the same way Collin looks at me. I think maybe you
just need to talk to him and be honest with him about what you want.
Because maybe you want the same things.”
“What if we don't want the same things?”
“Then we start digging.”

RHODES
Everybody in the locker room is looking at me like I'm about to break, and
it's really starting to piss me off.
I've been keeping my head down and trying to avoid confrontation all
week. Luckily, Collin, Miller, and Lowell have all stepped in to help keep
everything a little less crazy.
But it's hard when your teammates are looking at you like they can't
trust you. It's hard for me because, on one hand, I meant to lie, but on the
other, I didn't.
It's all so confusing.
Coach has been livid with me all week, and my ice time reflects that.
I've barely been getting five minutes since everything went to shit.
My mom is pissed at me. My teammates are pissed at me. The
organization is pissed at me. And worst of all, Ryan is pissed at me.
I miss her. I miss her so fucking much it hurts. I didn't know I could
hurt like this. I thought I knew pain when my life changed forever when the
skate blade connected with my face, but I was wrong.
It's nothing compared to this.
I want to talk to her more than anything, but I also want to give her
space.
I fully understand why she's upset with me. I wasn't upfront about
knowing the marriage certificate never got submitted. I slept on the
knowledge of that for days, knowing it changed everything.
And I did it because I was scared. Absolutely fucked out of my head.
Worried I was going to lose her.
In the end, I might have lost her anyway.
“All right, everybody. Suit up. Hit the ice for warmups. I want you to go
out there and play hard. Hit hard. Win battles in the corners. And make sure
Florida knows this is our house. We got it?” The room cheers. “Good. Now
get out there and win a fucking hockey game.”
Everyone is buzzing, that pregame high coursing through our veins.
They're ready for this.
I'm ready for this.
I'm especially ready for this because Colter plays for Florida now, and I
fully plan to land every hit on him possible tonight.
Denver did some digging for me and found out that the informant for
the article who blew this whole mess up was none other than Brittney. I
guess she's been digging into our marriage from the beginning. When she
came up blank on finding evidence, she concluded it was fake and tipped
off the press, who then did the work they're so good at.
It's funny. I don't think she even knew I was aware of the certificate
mishap. I think she was trying to get one over on me and shock me.
I don't care about her trying to hurt me. I just care about Ryan hurting.
So tonight, we're playing by hockey rules, and Colter is going to pay.
Warmups are uneventful. Colter stays to his side and I stay over to
mine, but I make sure to stare him down the entire time, letting him know
his time is coming.
By the time he's skating off the ice, he looks like he's about to piss his
pants.
Collin comes up and claps me on the back as we head down the tunnel
for puck drop. “Good, man?”
“Yep. Fucking dandy.”
A grin pulls up one side of his lips. “You're totally going to fuck him
up, aren't you?”
“Yep.”
He laughs, and I have a feeling he might get his licks in too.
The game kicks off, and within five minutes, the teams are already
coming to fisticuffs courtesy of our captain running Colter into the boards.
It was a clean hit, a solid hit. But Florida didn't like it.
After that, we score, making it 1–0. Luckily for Colter, we've yet to
share a shift out on the ice. No doubt something carefully orchestrated by
Coach. During the second period, he gets lucky again, and so do we. We're
up 3–0.
And then, finally, in the third period, when we are stomping their asses
5–0, his time comes.
We step out on the ice together, and I immediately drop the gloves. No
preamble, just straight for the guy. He knew it was coming, so he was
prepared.
“I'm not looking for a fight tonight, Rhodes,” he tries to reason.
“That's too fucking bad. You gotta answer for what you did.”
“What I did? I didn't do shit! That was all Brittney!”
I grab his sweater, finally getting the fucker to hold still, and we trade
blows.
Over and over and over again.
“Stop, stop!” he screams. “Fuck, man! I didn't do anything!”
“No, but your fucking fiancée did.”
“We're not even engaged, asshole.”
“What?” I loosen my grip on him and he goes tumbling to the ice on his
ass. The refs hold me back as if I'm about to hop on top of him. “What did
you say?”
“We're not even engaged. It was all for show.”
For show? She was never even engaged.
What the fuck?
“She was mad at you because you wouldn't propose to her. So, she
made up this big elaborate thing, hoping you'd get jealous and break up the
engagement. But no, you had to go get fucking married to some other little
slut.”
And that's when I truly see red.
This has to be the worst week of my life, and that includes the week I got
my scar.
Ryan and I aren't married.
I'm in love with her and she won't talk to me.
And now I'm fucking suspended for fighting.
Okay, so maybe not for fighting. It was more like slaughtering.
I lost it after he called Ryan a slut. Completely lost all sense of being
and just wailed on him. I don't remember anything that happened after that.
All I could focus on was beating him to a bloody pulp. And watching the
videos back, that's exactly what I did.
I don't feel bad about it either. If that makes me wrong, then I don't
care.
“Totally fucked this one up,” my agent says as he slides onto the stool
next to me.
I've had my ass planted on this stool at Slapshots for two hours now.
My sentence was handed down earlier this afternoon, and I can't seem to
make myself go home because it makes me too damn sad. All I do is think
about Ryan and hockey and everything I'm missing out on.
“Think it's safe to say I am totally boned.”
“Six games, Rhodes. And for that. It looks like petty retaliation.” He
holds out two fingers to the bartender, then nods toward my beer. “Doesn't
look good.”
“I know.”
The bartender slides two beers in front of us. One for me and one for
him.
“Other than this little blemish on your hockey career, how are you
feeling?”
“Like shit. Utter shit.”
Shep laughs at me. “Yep, been there.”
I've never meant those words more in my life mostly because I can't
remember a time when I've felt like this. After my accident, I felt awful.
But this? This is a whole new level of awful.
It's excruciating. Body-aching painful.
And I have nobody to blame but myself.
I know I shouldn't have kept the truth about our marriage from Ryan. It
was stupid. Easily the dumbest thing I could have done after we worked so
hard to build a genuine relationship and respect for one another.
But…I was scared.
God. That sounds so fucking ridiculous, but it's true.
I was scared that if she didn't have a reason to be married to me, she
wouldn't stay.
And why should she? I'm grumpy as shit half the time and I'm not the
best at expressing my emotions. Nobody wants to deal with that shit,
especially not someone like Ryan.
Someone so smart and funny and gorgeous and way fucking out of my
league.
She doesn't have a reason to stay—I know it and she does too.
I just…I hope that she does.
I miss her. I miss her laugh, her smile. I miss the way she looks first
thing in the morning and the way she smells. I miss her so damn much that I
hid her pillow from my housekeeper, so she didn't wash away Ryan's scent.
I'm a sick, sick man.
Sick and sad and so stupid.
“Why does love hurt like this?”
“No fucking clue, man, but it blows.” He runs a hand through his hair.
“I'm sorry Denver couldn't get out in front of this one. Totally blindsided us
all.”
I laugh, but there's no humor to it. “You can say that again.”
I pick up my fourth beer of the hour and knock the rest of it back in one
drink. I reach for the one Shep just bought me and sip at that too.
“Do you really think drinking away your troubles is the best thing to do
given your history?”
I glare over at him. “Mind your business, Shep.”
He lifts his hands up. “Just saying, last time that did not turn out so well
for you.”
He's got that right.
“Have you talked to her?”
I shake my head. “Not yet.”
“Do you know what you're going to say to her when you do?”
“Not a fucking clue.”
“Well, in my experience, it helps if you tell her you're in love with her.
Girls are really into the whole ‘being emotionally available' thing.”
I laugh at that. “Is that what's wrong with me? Am I just not
emotionally available enough?”
“Honestly? I think you're a little too emotionally available.”
Well, that's a first.
“Listen, I'm going to say this in the nicest way possible, but…that scar
really fucked you up in more ways than one. Yeah, it made that ugly mug of
yours even uglier. But it messed you up where it really counts.” He taps the
side of his head with his forefinger. “You're stuck up here, man. Like totally
stuck up here. You are just a giant closed-off mess because you're so damn
worried about what everybody sees when they look at you that you forget
about all the other important parts. Not to be a walking fucking cliché or
anything, but it's what's on the inside that counts the most. And your insides
are a little screwy.”
He's right. I know he's right. I am messed up in the head from my scar.
Messed up in the head because it's what everyone sees first. And
sometimes, it's all people see. After a while, it gets really hard to crack the
code of who is who.
“Can I ask you a question?” Shep says.
“Not like I have anything better to do right now. Go for it.”
“How come you married her?”
“I don't know, I was drunk.”
He gives me a look that says I'm full of shit. “Try again.”
“Man, I don't fucking know. I was drunk. I was like out-of-my-mind
drunk.”
“There's nothing in your mind that sticks out as to why? A reason for it
being her? Out of all the people you could have done this with, you did it
with her?”
I lift my shoulders. “I…well, I guess she felt safe.”
“Safe?”
“Yeah. Safe. I felt like I could be myself around her and I never had to
put on any sort of front or put up any walls.”
“And why is that? Why did you feel like that with her?”
“My eyes.”
“Your eyes?”
“Yeah. She always looked me in my eyes. A lot of people don't look me
in the eye. They just look at my scar, and then they're afraid to meet my
eyes because they don't like what they see or they don't want me to see
how they really feel, but Ryan? She always looked me in my eyes, even
when I didn't want her to, and I thought that was brave. I thought she was
brave, and that made me want to be brave. Kind of stupid because, I mean,
look at me. I'm a giant, scary, beastly dude getting showed up by this little
beauty who is bolder than I could ever dream to be.”
“So be it.”
“Huh?”
“Be it. Be brave. Be brave for her. Be brave for yourself. Tell her how
you feel. Tell her what you want. And tell her so damn loudly she has no
choice but to listen to you. Just be brave.”

RYAN
“She's cheatin'!”
“Cheatin'? You can't cheat at word searches!” Grams hollers back at
Harper.
“Oh, bullshit, you old coot. You're cheating and you know it.”
“Show me how to cheat, then, Ms. Know-It-All.”
I grin at the two of them as they bicker back and forth.
We've been sitting at Grams' apartment for the last two hours doing
word searches. Harper got the brilliant idea to set a timer an hour ago and
see who can beat the word search the fastest. Grams has beat her every
time.
“I don't know how, but I'm going to figure it out.”
Never mind that my grandmother does about twenty-five of these a day.
She's practically an expert at them by now. There's no way Harper is going
to beat her, but apparently, she's going to keep trying. She sets the clock,
then calls out a countdown, and they're off to the races all over again.
I've been sitting here trying not to look at my phone to check and see
how many times Rhodes has not called me.
It's been two weeks of silence, two weeks of absolute heartache.
I wanted so badly to reach out to him after I saw his fight and again
when I saw he was handed a six-game suspension because of it, but I didn't
know what to say.
Still don't know what to say.
Grams wasn't happy with me when she found out my marriage wasn't
real…for all of like two seconds. Then her romance-loving heart was over
the moon that I fell in love with him. She said it was that “movie-worthy”
kind of moment and if I didn't fix it, she'd never forgive me.
I want to fix it, but what do you say to your fake husband that you fell
in love with?
It's weird because on one hand, I understand why Rhodes kept it from
me. It was easier that way. Legally married or not, we'd already told
everyone. We kind of didn't have a choice but to go through with it unless
we wanted to come clean about everything, and I think that would have
caused even more of a headache.
But for Rhodes to keep it from me the way he did? That hurt. I thought
we built trust with one another. Thought we respected each other. I thought
that what we had was real, even if it started for not-so-real reasons. And I
naively thought he felt about me how I feel about him.
You don't let the person you love be blindsided like that though.
“Game's on!” Grams' roommate, Nancy, calls from the other room,
drawing everyone's attention. “We got hockey butts on TV, ladies!”
I'd be lying if I said the urge to walk into that living room and watch it
isn't eating a hole in me right now. Tonight is Rhodes' first game back since
his suspension, and I am dying to see him play.
I didn't realize how in love I fell with the sport. Not having hockey in
my life over the last few weeks has been weird. I miss it. I miss the thrill of
watching the guys fly down the ice. I miss the crashing into the boards. I
miss the crazy shots thrown at the net that should never go in but somehow
always do. I miss the announcers being total goofballs and mispronouncing
so many names.
I miss hockey, and most of all, I miss my hockey player.
I try to ignore the pit in my stomach that's been steadily growing the
last few weeks.
“Well, I don't know about you ladies, but I'm going to go watch some
hockey,” Grams says, rising from her spot at the kitchen table.
Harper's wide eyes find mine to see what the hell I'm going to do.
I know she's dying to watch, but she's trying to be a supportive friend.
That's why she's here today instead of at the game cheering her fiancé on.
Solidarity and all that.
She lifts a brow, and I can see the excitement in her eyes. “What do you
say? You want to go watch some grown men be paid entirely too much
money to chase around a vulcanized rubber disc on frozen water with knife
blades on their feet?”
Well, I guess that's one way to ask if I want to watch hockey.
“What the hell? I can't avoid the game forever.”
“That's my girl!” Grams says.
We make our way into the living room just as the puck drops.
And there he is.
God, even looking at him on this awful, outdated television, he's
beautiful. He looks different and the same all at once.
My heart aches just seeing him. My body yearns for him.
Harper and Grams take the two open spots on the couch, and I stand at
the back, eyes glued to the television.
I don't look away for a single second, which means I don't miss the
goal he scores just four minutes into the game. I don't miss the way the
crowd erupts, screaming his name.
“BEEEAAASSSTTT!” they belt out.
And he smiles.
Adrian Rhodes smiles.
Full-blown, teeth-showing, cheek-splitting smile.
And it's breathtaking.
He's breathtaking.
Gameplay resumes, but not before everybody on the bench goes wild
and congratulates him on the goal. They're clearly happy to have him back.
The Comets score another goal in the first period, but unfortunately,
Vancouver comes back to score twice in the second to tie it up. At the
beginning of the third, Rhodes takes a hit, and he goes down hard.
My breath catches in my throat, and I swear I don't breathe the entire
time he's down on the ice. Collin and Lowell help him off and down the
tunnel. I breathe a sigh of relief when the announcers tell us he's back on
the bench and feeling fine.
It makes me both sad and happy I'm not currently there in the crowd.
With just three minutes to go, it's the damn rookie back to save the day,
and the Comets take the win. Harper, Grams, Nancy, and I all cheer, glad
the guys were able to make the comeback and win.
The postgame show starts, and I head to the kitchen to start on the
dishes in Grams' sink. There's nothing on there for me to watch.
I'm about halfway into a sink full of dishes when I hear it.
Rhodes.
I whirl around, hands still soaking wet from the water, not caring that
I'm dripping it everywhere.
“Adrian, can you tell us how it felt to be back out on the ice after
missing six games?”
“Good.”
I laugh at his one-syllable answer. Typical Rhodes.
“Adrian, can you walk us through that game where you got suspended?
What happened?”
I lean closer to the TV, dying to know the details too.
He sits forward, lips nearly touching the microphone. He tugs the hat
he's wearing down lower.
“What happened is that Joshua Colter said some very…” He runs a
hand over his jaw, trying to find the right words. “Uh, unsportsmanlike
things about a person who is very special to me. And, well, I wasn't going
to let that happen.”
He sits back again, crossing his arms over his chest.
“There seems to be a lot of bad blood between you and Mr. Colter. Is
this because he's engaged to your ex-girlfriend?” someone else asks.
“Uh, no. It's because he's a dick.”
Several people in the room snicker, a few gasp.
Me? I cackle.
“Adrian, can you tell us what's going on with your marriage to beauty
influencer Ryan Bell? It was announced over the summer that you two had
tied the knot during a weekend in Las Vegas, but now there are reports that
the marriage never happened. Can you elaborate on that for us?”
He shifts around in his chair, clearly uncomfortable being in front of all
the cameras and being put on the spot.
“Come on, let's stick to hockey, huh?” Someone speaks up for him, and
it sounds like Collin offscreen.
“Look, I'm only going to talk about this one time, so everybody go
ahead and get your little tape recorders ready.” He pauses, waiting for them
to do just that. “You all good?”
There's a murmuring amongst the crowd, confirming they are ready to
go.
Rhodes spins his ballcap backward, and I know the move is significant.
He's putting his scar on display.
My chest swells with pride.
He sits forward, lips to the microphone, and I hold my breath for the
second time tonight.
“The announcement made this summer was the result of a drunken night
in Las Vegas where Ryan Bell and I were led to believe we had gotten
married. Honestly, it was a silly mistake that came courtesy of my good
friend Jose and his buddy Jack, and a little thing called poor decisionmaking.” A few people laugh. “Truthfully, we had no business doing what
we did, and I regret it.”
My heart sinks.
“But I don't regret it for the reasons most people might think.” He takes
a deep breath, then exhales slowly. “I regret it because I didn't do it for the
right reasons. I did it because my heart hurt, and I wanted it to stop hurting.
That is the only reason I regret it. I don't regret who I married, and I don't
regret the last few months I've spent falling in love with my wife. And yes,
I said wife. Because to me, for all intents and purposes, we did get married.
The only thing we didn't do was sign the certificate. But we took vows. We
exchanged rings. And we made promises that, if Ryan forgives me for this
whole mess, I intend to keep.”
The room is silent.
Completely still.
Then, it erupts.
Everyone is talking over one another, and it's nearly impossible to
decipher what's being asked. I hear my name. I hear Rhodes' name. I hear
words like annulment and divorce and deceit.
Rhodes just leans down into the microphone and says, “No further
questions. Thank you.”
Then he disappears off stage.
And I'm left standing here stunned.
“Ryan?” Harper asks quietly, moving to stand in front of me. “Are
you…okay?”
“I…don't know,” I answer honestly.
“That”—Grams points to the TV—“is what us romance lovers call a
grand gesture. This is the part in the movie where you run through the
airport for him and confess your love before he hops a flight to Paris, never
to be seen again.” She grabs my shoulders. “How do you feel, Ryan?”
How do I feel?
How do I feel?
I feel…shocked. Stunned.
And so damn in love with him it hurts.
I'm mad and hurt and confused, but this is it—an ugly moment.
I can't give up now just because it's hard. I can't walk away just
because my heart is hurting. If I think Rhodes is truly worth it—and I do—I
need to fight for what I want.
Because these ugly moments? They make all the pretty ones even more
beautiful.
“I love him,” I say.
Grams grins, squeezing my shoulders. “Then go. Go find your airport.
Go confess how you feel.”
“But what—”
“I swear if you say some silly shit like ‘But what if he doesn't love me,'
I will knock you upside the head,” Nancy says. “If you don't get your ass
out that door and find your man in the next ten seconds, I'm taking off after
him myself.”
I look to Harper, and she nods, shoving her car keys at me. “Go. I'll text
Collin to see where he's at.”
She doesn't have to tell me twice.
I hop in the car and drive.
Truthfully, I don't need Harper or Collin to tell me where he's at
because I know Rhodes.
I know him.
It's crazy to think that just a few months ago, he was just the teammate
of my best friend's boyfriend.
Now? Now he's my world. That Prince Charming I've been waiting for.
He's my Beast, and I'm his Beauty.
We make no sense together, but I'll be damned if I let that stop us.
A message chimes over the infotainment center of Harper's new car and
I press the Read button.
Harper: He's at Slapshots.
I knew it.
With it being a game night, I'm not expecting to find parking, but
somehow luck is on my side, and I maneuver the car into a spot just across
the street.
I waste no time darting across the intersection, ignoring the beeps and
shouts from drivers, and yank open the door to the beloved bar.
The place is packed, but it doesn't stop me from spotting Rhodes
instantly. He's so huge, he's kind of hard to miss.
God. Just seeing him sitting across the bar… My fingers itch to touch
him. My body longs to be near him. I want so damn badly to throw myself
in his lap and press my lips to his.
On shaky legs, I cross the bar and slide up next to him.
I feel the air crackle between us almost instantly.
I signal for the bartender and place an order. When he returns with four
shots, I slide two to Rhodes and keep the others to myself.
Then, with a steadying breath, I turn to my husband.
“Want to hear a love story?”
24
RHODES
A warm body slides onto the stool next to me, signaling to the bartender for
a drink. “I'll take two shots each of Jose and Jack.”
“Coming right up,” the bartender says, turning to pour the shots.
He's only gone a minute or two, then he's placing the shots in front of
the person next to me.
They slide a shot of each my way.
“Want to hear a love story?”
“I'm not really one for romance, but I'll bite.”
She rests her elbow on the bar top, taking a shot glass in her hand. “I
met this guy last year. He was the best friend of my best friend's boyfriend.
If that's not confusing, I don't know what is. Anyway, I guess we became…
allies of sorts. We weren't really friends, but we weren't not friends either.
We were shoved into the same group activities whenever anyone could coax
him out of his big, dark castle. Oh, he has a castle, by the way. How cool is
that?”
“I think a big, dark castle sounds nice.”
“Hmm. Maybe you should meet my friend, then. You'd probably get
along.” She waves her hand. “So anyway, this past summer, we all took a
vacation to Las Vegas. A little fun, a little gambling, and some drinking.
Lots and lots of drinking. Too much of it for certain. Then, like a total
Prince Charming swooping in to save the day, guess who offers to take care
of me?”
“Oh wait, don't tell me—it's the best friend of the best friend's
boyfriend?”
“Yes!” She slaps the bar top. “What are the freakin' odds?”
“I'd say pretty good considering he was forced to take care of you. He
did not choose it.”
She narrows her eyes. “Anyway. He's doing the prince thing, taking
care of me, making sure I don't choke on my own vomit. You know, the
usual.”
“He sounds like a really good dude.”
“He was. But in a crazy twist of events, it was suddenly me, the
princess, taking care of the prince. You see, he had his heart broken, and he
needed it mended. So being the selfless soul I am, I stepped up.”
“How kind of you.”
“Right? I took him out dancing and drinking and gave him a magical
night he'll never forget.”
“Oh, no. You gave him herpes, didn't you?”
The look she gives me is murderous. “No. Better. I gave him a ring. Or
he gave me a ring. I really can't remember because I was shit-faced.”
“Wait. I thought you were taking care of the prince?”
“At that point, we were taking care of each other.”
“Okay, okay. So, what happens next?”
“Well, in the wee hours of the not-so-morning, we wake up to find
ourselves suddenly hitched and the evidence sprinkled all over social
media.”
“That sounds terrible.”
“It was.” She shudders. “See, the prince was this famous sports dude.”
“Famous sports dude?”
“Yep. He literally played with his stick for a living.”
I try not to choke on my beer.
“So, we did what any smart, quick-thinking pair would do—we faked it.
We're talking move in together, pretend to be in love, fake it.”
“And it worked? This ruse of yours?”
“Oh, certainly. Nobody was the wiser.”
“Definitely not a single soul. You two sound like incredible actors.”
“The best there ever was.”
“What happened next?”
“Well, the dark moment.”
“Dark moment?”
“Yeah.” She nods. “You know, the big sad scene where everyone gets
their heart broken and nothing feels like it's ever going to be right again.”
“Ah. Yes. I am familiar with that.”
“Well, it hit them hard.”
“This is starting to sound less and less like a love story.”
“That's because I'm not finished and you keep interrupting me,
Rhodes.”
I tuck my lips together, gesturing for her to continue.
She tosses her hair over her shoulder. “Anyway, then…ugh. No, no,
never mind. You totally ruined it with all your talking!” She turns to me,
daggers in her eyes.
“I ruined it with all my talking?”
“Yes! I was doing this super cute fairy-tale-story thing because I love
fairy tales and then at the end I was going to be all I love you, Adrian
Rhodes and you were going to be all”—she puffs her chest out, dropping
her voice low—“I love you too, baby. And then we were going to make out
like fools in public and live happily ever after.”
“Okay, one, I do not sound like that.”
“Oh, you totally do. All deep and growly. It's like—”
I kiss her.
I kiss her to shut her up and I kiss her because I can't stand not kissing
her for another second.
It's a slow, languid kiss. Soft, gentle, and hopefully full of all the things
I want to say to her.
She smiles against me when I pull away.
“Two,” I continue, “I'm going to need to hear you say it again.”
“All deep and growly like—”
“No. The other part.”
“Oh, the part where I say I love you?” I nod, and she brushes her lips
against mine. “I love you, Adrian Rhodes.”
“Yeah?”
She nods. “So much.”
I sigh, feeling whole for the first time in a long time. “Good. Because I
love you too.”
“Yeah?”
“So much.”
I kiss her again.
And again.
And again.
In fact, I don't stop kissing her until she's literally in my lap and we're
making a scene.
“We should stop.”
“We should.”
But we don't.
Not until the owner of the bar comes over and taps us on the shoulder
do we finally pull apart.
Ryan slips back onto her stool, and I dutifully stay on mine.
“I'm sorry,” I tell her, keeping my hand on her leg.
Those lips that I can't seem to get enough of pull into a frown. “I
know.”
“I'm an idiot.”
“I know that too.”
I laugh. “God, I missed your smart mouth.”
“I know that too.” She winks, then sobers up quickly. “I won't lie, I'm
still upset with you. It hurt to find out like I did. I wish you could have been
honest with me. I thought…” She exhales shakily. “I thought we meant
more than that to each other. I thought I deserved your honesty.”
“We did. You did. You do. It was a stupid decision on my part, one
made by a scared, foolish man.”
“Scared?”
I gulp back the lump in my throat. “Of losing you. Of you realizing that
you could do so much better than me.”
She shakes her head. “When are you going to understand that you're
enough, Rhodes?”
She takes my face in her hands, her thumb skating over my scar. I lean
into her touch, needing it because it's been far too fucking long.
“You are enough,” she says, “and I love you just the way you are.”
I swallow, nodding. “I believe you.”
She presses her lips to mine once more but this time it's softer. Slower.
And I taste the truth of her words in her kiss.
When she pulls back, she says, “Did you mean what you said? During
the postgame junket?”
“Which part? I said a lot. Mostly blocked it out.”
“About keeping promises.”
“Every fucking word.”
“Good.” She grins, lifting her shot glass. “To mistakes.”
I lift mine too. “And promises.”
We toss the shots back, and I wipe my hand across my mouth.
“So, you never did tell me how that story ended.”
“Oh, that?” She grins. “It looks like it's still being written, but I'm
predicting a happily ever after.”
“I'm predicting you're right…wife.”
EPILOGUE
RYAN
“That woman is exhausting.” I flop down into my chair and reach for my
champagne glass, gulping back half of it in one go. “Remind me to never
get married.”
“Again.” He tugs my hand into his lap, rubbing his fingertips over the
gold band that still sits around my finger. He tried replacing it once with a
big diamond set, but I refused. I love it too much. “Unless you want to.
Have the big celebration and all that, I mean.”
One weekend when the Comets were facing Vegas, Rhodes and I snuck
off after the game and made our marriage official.
This time, we didn't share our elopement with the world. Just with
Harper and Collin, the way it should have been from the beginning.
Surprisingly, Grams and Rhodes' parents were fine with it. I think they
were all just happy we found a way to fall in love after the whole lying-tothe-world-and-it-blowing-up-in-our-faces fiasco.
Every now and then, Rhodes will ask if I want to do it the “right way,”
but I always give him the same answer.
“I already have everything I want.” I trace the rose he has tattooed on
his ring finger. He surprised me with it after the Comets ended their season
early, losing in the second round of the playoffs. He said even though they
lost, this way he'd always remember everything good that happened that
season.
His lips twitch, fighting a smile. “Everything?”
“Well, I mean, I would like to get out of here, maybe have an orgasm or
two. But beyond that, yes, everything.”
He leans into me, his lips brushing against mine. “I think I could make
that happen.” He captures my mouth in a kiss, his tongue quickly pushing
past my lips, ramping up the heat.
I'm lost in the moment, completely captivated by the way he commands
my mouth, his tongue sliding over mine as his hand slides up my face and
into my long blonde curls, pulling me closer.
I have no idea how much time passes before I hear a throat clearing.
“Excuse me, Ryan.” Harper's mother practically hisses my name. I'm
not sure if it's because she's never been a big fan of me or because I'm
currently making out with my husband in the middle of her daughter's
wedding. “I could really use your help with the—”
“Caterer? We have it covered, Mom.” Harper places her hand on her
mother's shoulder, pulling her attention. “Why don't you go dance with
Uncle Randy? I'm sure Aunt Blythe would love for you to take him off her
hands for a bit. She looks tired.”
Her mother glances over at the fun, older couple swinging around the
dance floor. They both look like they're having a complete blast, but I know
what Harper is trying to do—save me.
“Oh, all right then,” her mother says. “Randy always was a handful.”
Harper's mother sends me one last disapproving look before scurrying
away.
“God, that woman is exhausting.” Harper shakes her head, grabbing
Rhodes' glass of champagne and downing it all at once.
“That's exactly what I said!”
“It's no wonder my sister moved here after her divorce. I mean, can you
imagine having to deal with a cheating ex-husband and my mother?”
Harper shudders, her lacy gray dress shaking around her. When she first
suggested a gray dress, I thought she was out of her mind, but the beautiful
ball gown-style garment fits her perfectly. “Speaking of my sister, have you
seen her around here?”
“Actually, I think I saw her and Lowell step outside for a moment,”
Rhodes answers. “They seem to be getting along, which I suppose is good
considering…”
He trails off, but we all know what he's alluding to. Hollis and Lowell
meeting did not go as everyone had planned.
“Well, I'm glad. I was worried.” Harper waves her hand. “Anyway, you
two get back to Frenching. I'm going to find my husband.” She giggles,
bouncing on the heels of her black glitter Converse. “Husband—oh my
gosh, I have one of those!” She claps her hands and takes off in pursuit of
him.
I peer around the decorated venue and still can't believe it myself. With
the black curtains and tablecloths, spooky décor, and low lighting, these two
managed to have a beautiful dark-themed wedding in the middle of July and
pull it off spectacularly.
I wave at Grams, who is currently rocking back and forth with Miller,
her date for the evening. How she's managed to wrap the entire team
around her finger in the last year, I have no clue, but it's adorable to see the
grown men fussing over her. They're always rotating in and out of her
apartment, helping to hang or move something, or just there to visit. I think
most of them just miss their own grandparents, and since Grams is more
than willing to have the company, they take as much advantage of it as she
does.
She shoots me a wink and a thumbs-up. I shake my head, grinning.
My eyes drift over to Harper and Collin, who are now wrapped around
each other in the middle of the dance floor. They look like picturesque
newlyweds, heads bent together, smiles plastered on their faces. It's hard to
believe there was ever a time when Harper was so reluctant to love Collin.
“I can't believe they're married.”
“I can't believe we're married,” Rhodes says. “It feels like just
yesterday we were waking up hungover in Vegas, the sins of the night
before hanging over us.”
Some days it does feel like just yesterday.
Some days it feels like a lifetime ago.
But every day with Rhodes…every day feels just right.
Unable to stop myself, I lean over and press my lips to his.
He grins against my mouth. “What was that for, cupcake?”
“Cupcake?”
He shrugs. “Trying it out. Not a fan?”
“No. Not a fan, buttercup.” His face pulls into the scowl I'm all too
familiar with, and I laugh. “Not a fan?”
“Not even a little.”
A quick shutter noise catches our attention.
“Sorry. Couldn't resist.” The photographer grins at me. “Thanks again
for recommending me for this job, Ryan. Photographing a Carolina Comets
player's wedding…” He shakes his head in disbelief. “This is going to be
such a bright spot in my portfolio.”
“I'm glad you could fit them into your schedule, Winston. Who knows,
with the way this team seems to be pairing off, you might have more
projects in your future.”
“Grams and Miller do seem pretty cozy,” Rhodes remarks.
Winston laughs. “Speaking of cozy, I really don't want to miss this
moment.” He takes off to grab a few shots as Miller drops Grams down into
a dip, her mouth falling open in shock.
“That kid is way too smooth for his own good.” Rhodes shakes his head
then rises from his chair and holds his hand out to me. “All right, let's go
show them up.”
“You want to dance?”
“What? I dance.”
I lift a brow. “Since when?”
He leans down, lips against my ear. “Don't pretend you don't remember
our evening in Vegas. I distinctly remember someone asking to be spanked
as we danced.” My cheeks flame red, and he chuckles darkly. “That's what I
thought.”
He straightens and extends his palm once more with a cocky grin
pulling at his lips. I place my hand in his, letting him pull me to my feet.
We make our way out onto the floor, and Rhodes spins me into his
arms, tugging me close. My body lines up against his like we were made to
do this together, pressing against one another in all the right places.
The song that's playing isn't even slow, but we don't care, swaying
leisurely anyway.
“Can I ask you something?” he asks quietly.
“Of course.”
“Do you remember why we decided to get married? The first time,” he
amends.
I shake my head. “No. That night is still fuzzy.”
He nods. “For me too. I can remember feeling safe with you, feeling
comfortable. And happy—though that could have been the alcohol.” I
laugh. “But I can't remember the moment we said fuck it and did it.”
“I can't either. Sometimes I wish I could, but other times…I don't know.
I kind of like the magic of it. They say you tell the truth when you're drunk,
and maybe our truth was this.”
“I had a crush on you, you know.”
I pull my head back, looking up at him. “What? You did not.”
“I did. That first time I saw you, under the arena lights, I thought you
were gorgeous, and I had a crush on you. I mean, I didn't realize it then, but
I do now. I think a big reason I was always extra grumpy to you was
because you intimidated me.”
“I intimidated you? I'm sorry, but have you seen your scowl?”
He laughs. “I'm being serious.”
“I am too! You're scary when you're all…growly.”
“Growly?”
“Yeah. You know…beastly.”
“I've always hated that nickname.”
“I can imagine why.”
“But I don't hate it anymore.”
“No? What changed?”
“I found my beauty.”
I grin. “That was cheesy. Like romantic comedy cheesy.”
“You loved it.”
“I love you.”
He captures my lips in a searing kiss, so quick and hot that I'm lucky
he's holding me up right now because my knees can't take it.
“Do you think anyone will notice if we sneak away?”
“I sure as hell hope not.” He grabs my wrist, hauling me off the dance
floor in an instant.
“Rhodes!” I admonish. “What are you doing?”
“Kidnapping you.”
“Taking me to your big, dark castle.”
“Later. But for now…” He wrenches a door open, peering inside. “This
will have to do.”
“I am not going into a storage closet with you.”
“You are too.”
“Am not.”
He takes a threatening step toward me, and I have to tip my head back
to meet his heated stare. “Has anyone ever told you that you argue too
much, Ryan? Someone really ought to spank you for it.”
His words from our night in Vegas send a spark through me, and I arch a
challenging brow. “Are you offering?”
“Yes.” He takes another step, his lips ghosting along my ear. “Now, get
in the closet…wife.”
He doesn't have to say it again.

HOLLIS
Weddings are supposed to be happy days. They are supposed to be filled
with smiles and love and tears of joy.
Weddings are not supposed to be filled with infinite sadness and enough
tears to fill a damn decorative mason jar.
But here I am, sitting in my car, crying my eyes out because my little
sister is marrying the love of her life this weekend and I just signed my
divorce papers earlier this week.
I can't force myself to get out and face it all.
Don't get me wrong, I am beyond thrilled for my little sister. Harper has
always been a cynic when it comes to love, so the fact that she's about to
walk down the aisle and exchange vows is monumental. It's an even bigger
deal because she's marrying NHL superstar Collin Wright, but that's a
whole different conversation.
Watching her get a perfect life she never really wanted when I was the
little girl who planned her wedding at five years old and thought I had
found my happily ever after? Yeah, it stings.
Not nearly as much as finding out your husband had a mistress and
they'd been sleeping together before you got married, but it still stings.
I swipe at the tears running down my cheeks, frustrated by them—my
tears and my ex-husband and his mistress. As embarrassing as it was when
Harper came home to tell my mother and me she was engaged, I cried then
too. In front of her. Like straight up just burst into tears like an awful big
sister.
After that whole mess, there is no way I can walk inside looking like
this.
Another tear slips down my cheek, and I swipe at it. I am not about to
ruin my sister's big weekend with my silly tears.
An old beat-up truck blasting music so loudly it's rattling my windows
comes careening into the parking lot, whipping into the space next to mine
as if it belongs here. I know for a fact it does not.
My brows slam together in frustration because the jerk doesn't even
bother turning the music down. Doesn't he know two people who are madly
in love are inside about to rehearse a ceremony so tomorrow they can start a
new life together?
Ugh.
A set of fresh tears streaks down my cheeks at the thought. I squeeze my
eyes shut, trying to push away the thoughts of what I've lost, then wipe at
my face again, which I'm sure is a mess. I pull down the sun visor to check
the tiny mirror inside and—yep, I'm a mess. Streaks of black run down my
cheeks and a mess of makeup sits under each eye. All because my favorite
mascara wasn't available in waterproof because of course it wasn't.
It's not a big surprise though. Nothing has gone right since I was
blindsided by my cheating ex-husband.
My car was backed into, and the driver took off…in a parking lot that
had no cameras.
I was detained for shoplifting because the cashier didn't want to believe
me that the candy bar wrapper in the cart wasn't mine and I was feeling
petty enough to argue.
Oh, and that haircut I treated myself with? Butchered, leaving me with a
short bob, which I did not want.
It's been a challenging couple of months, to say the least.
The only positive is that this divorce hasn't been dragged out any longer
than necessary. Thad granted me the divorce when he realized I had copies
of his text messages. You'd think, being a lawyer, he would have done a
better job of covering his tracks, but nope. He left everything out, right
there for me to see. A part of me wonders if he did it on purpose. The way
he acted in the months leading up to our wedding—like how he wasn't
invested in the planning and was picking fights—should have been a red
flag, but I was too caught up in the years I'd put into our relationship and
what I wanted for my future to see it for what it was.
Lies.
All big lies.
I should have listened to my best friend, Emilia, when she said Thad
was a douchebag who wasn't to be trusted. Sure, she said it when she was
drunk, but there's truth to our intoxicated ramblings, right?
“His name is Thad, Hollis. That should tell you everything you need to
know about the douchebag.”
In hindsight, she was right.
I wish she were here now. She always makes me laugh. But I have to
suffer through tonight alone.
Tomorrow, though…tomorrow we drink. And then drink some more. I
already know I'm going to need it.
With a sigh, I reach across my BMW—a hush gift from Thad since he
didn't want his transgressions getting back to his buddies at the firm—to
pop open the glove box.
And…nothing.
Not a damn thing.
“The one time I don't have ten billion Starbucks napkins shoved in
there…”
I slam it closed, then lean my head back against the seat, trying not to
cry yet again. I don't need an even bigger mess to clean up.
“Ugh. Get ahold of yourself, Hollis. You're acting ridiculous. It's just a
napkin. That's it. It's a napkin.”
Tears sting my eyes again because it's not just a napkin—it's a wedding
too, a wedding I am certainly going to bawl my way through, and not
exactly for all the right reasons.
I squeeze my eyes shut to block out all the negative thoughts that are
hurtling their way through my mind and take a deep breath.
Then another.
And one—
“OH MY GOD!”
I glare over at the old truck next to me, that damn music still rattling my
windows. With the dents and scratches and the bumper hanging on by what
looks to be a thread of duct tape, I don't understand how the truck itself
hasn't rattled apart with how loud the music is.
The windows are tinted, but not so dark that I can't see inside. The
driver is leaned back in the seat without a care in the world, a pair of dark
sunglasses covering his eyes, looking like he's not moving anytime soon.
Is this asshole serious?
It's annoying. He's annoying.
I bet Harper and Collin must be inside right now wondering what the
hell that loud, obnoxious noise is. I'll be damned if this asshole is going to
ruin my little sister's rehearsal.
I shove my car door open, march to the driver's side of the asshole's
truck, and smack my palm against the window.
He doesn't move.
What the…
I smack the window again.
No reaction. Not even a flinch.
Is this idiot sleeping?
I smack the window a third time and…nothing.
I huff, rolling my eyes skyward. Then, because I am off my rocker
completely, I knock one last time—only there is no window, and I connect
with the stranger's face, knocking his sunglasses askew.
I…I just hit a person!
“Oh shit!” I squeak out, retracting my hand and slapping it over my
mouth.
I just got a divorce, my life is in shambles, I just hit a person, and now
I'm probably going to jail for assault. Can my life get any worse right now?
The guy—who looks vaguely familiar, but I can't quite place him—
works his jaw back and forth from the unexpected hit. He brings his large
hand up, his long fingers caressing the spot where my palm connected with
his face. His chest rises and then falls with a heavy sigh.
I hold my breath as he slowly—like at a glacial-pace slow—pulls his
aviator sunglasses down and pierces me with the most dazzling green eyes I
have ever seen. They're so unique and beautiful that I audibly gasp.
Luckily, preventing even further embarrassment, my hand is still firmly
over my mouth, so I doubt he hears it.
His gorgeous eyes that are the color of pine narrow, and even that's not
enough to get me to stop staring into them. They are so different than
anything I've ever seen before. It's not the color that makes them so unique.
It's the pain and secrets that are hiding within the swirls that make them
stand out. This guy has been through things that have hardened him.
A sympathetic frown pulls at my lips because I can understand. I've
been through things that have hardened me too.
“Are you fucking serious?”
And just like that, my sympathy is gone.
His tone is sharp and dark. And yeah, okay, he might have a reason to
be pissed since I did just technically hit him, but still—he's the asshole who
came barreling into the parking lot when there's a damn wedding rehearsal
inside. Rude on its own, but especially rude since he doesn't even belong
here.
“I'm dead serious. Your shitty taste in music is loud and disruptive and
you have no business being here.”
It's not shitty taste in music. I love the song. Everyone loves the song
that's playing. It's a crime to not love Queen, but I'm not about to admit
that to the jerk.
He lifts a dark brow. “That so?”
“That's so. This is a private event.”
“Private event, huh?”
“Yes, and—”
He scoffs…then hits the button to roll his window back up, effectively
cutting me off.
My jaw slackens as I stare at the truck, watching him disappear again.
Who the hell does this guy think he is?
I'm about to bang on the damn thing again, but I don't have the chance.
The loud rumble of his vehicle abruptly dies, and he pushes the door open. I
jump back so I don't get whacked with it, though I guess it would be fair if I
did get hit.
He slides out of the truck and towers over me. He's so tall I literally
have to tip my head back to look up at him. He reaches up and turns the
baseball cap on his head backward, and I'm annoyed with myself for
finding the action even remotely attractive, especially since this guy is a
total tool.
Even though he's wearing those damn aviator sunglasses again, I can
feel his heated stare. I glare right back, crossing my arms over my chest,
refusing to back down. I try not to think about how ridiculous I likely look
right about now. I stand at least six inches shorter than him even though I'm
wearing heels and am all dolled up in a tea-length dress for the rehearsal.
“This is a private event. What part of private are you not
comprehending?”
I point back at the sign that clearly says the parking lot is closed, but he
doesn't seem to care.
No.
His lips twitch.
He's amused, and that pisses me off even more.
He leans back against his dirty old truck and crosses his arms over his
chest like he's settling in and not planning to leave when he's clearly not
supposed to be here. “I guess all of it. Can you explain what the word
private means?”
I scoff. “It means you're not invited. You don't belong here.”
He nods. “And how exactly do you know I don't belong here? For all I
know, it's you who doesn't belong here.”
I wave a hand down my outfit. “My attire says otherwise.”
“I see, and why is your attire so important?”
“Ha!” I point a finger at him. “If you belonged here, that wouldn't even
be a question. You'd know exactly why I'm dressed like—”
“Like you have a stick up your ass?”
For the second time since I met this man, I audibly gasp at his words.
A stick up my ass?
Thad used to get upset whenever I wore something too low-cut to one of
the many client dinners we had to attend. I learned fast that I didn't want to
rock that boat and should cover up.
I never thought my wardrobe screamed stick up my ass though.
I narrow my eyes at him, choosing to ignore his jab. “You need to leave
before I call security.”
I have no clue if this place has security, but he doesn't know I don't
know.
He laughs, and it's a low, deep sound. “Go ahead. Call them.”
I don't like the confidence in his words. He sounds way too sure that
there is nobody I can call.
“I will.”
“Good. I'll wait.”
He sinks back against the truck even more, watching me.
Waiting.
And waiting.
“Well?” he asks, arching a brow. “Are you going to call?”
“I don't have my phone.”
“That's okay. You can use mine.”
He reaches into his back pocket and produces the latest iPhone, holds it
my way. I stare down at it with surprise, the device the sheer opposite of
what he's driving. He doesn't look like he should have the latest anything,
not when his truck is literally being held together with—holy crap, are those
zip ties around the mirror?
“Go ahead. Call.” He shakes his phone at me. When I don't reach for
the device, a slow grin pulls at his lips. “Oh, I see. You were never going to
call. You were just trying to scare me off, huh?”
“No. I'll call.”
He wiggles the phone again, and I don't take it.
He lets out another low laugh, then slips the phone into his back pocket.
His arms go back over his chest, and his stupid lips are pulled into a stupid
grin. “Listen, darlin', I—”
“I am not your darlin'. I'm not your anything.” I stalk toward him, lips
curled at the unwanted nickname, and I don't stop until I'm just a few feet
away, my finger pointed firmly at him. He doesn't look the least bit scared.
In fact, he looks amused that he's riled me up, and it pisses me off even
more. “You're trespassing at a private event, and I'm—”
He holds a hand up, stopping me. “Let me get this straight. You hit me,
and you're mad at me?”
“I didn't hit you on purpose! And the only reason I hit you at all is that I
was trying to get you to turn down your damn music because this is a
private event and you're—”
“Let me guess…I'm trespassing?” He shakes his head, then pushes off
the truck, leaning down until we're eye level. Our noses are nearly touching
at this point, and I should be totally freaked out because this guy is a
stranger. But I'm not. I'm too angry to be freaked out.
I also shouldn't be noticing that his bottom lip is bigger than his top or
how soft his lips look.
But I do.
Just for a second.
Then, he opens those lips, and all thoughts of anything other than anger
fly out the window.
“Well, I have news for you, darlin': I'm not trespassing. I—”
The doors of the venue swing open, pulling our attention.
“Oh my gosh! You're here!” My little sister claps her hands, bouncing
on her heels excitedly, the biggest smile on her face. I can't help but grin
back at her. Collin stands just behind her, hands in his pockets, watching her
with a smile on his face as she zips down the stairs toward me.
Harper pulls me into a hug, and I squeeze her back, melting into her
warmth. For a moment, I almost forget about everything that's just
happened and the jerk standing a few feet away from me.
She pulls back, looking me over. “You look…”
“Like a mess? I know.” I wipe at the mascara that's pooled under my
eyes. “Sorry. It's kind of been an emotional morning.”
A sympathetic smile pulls at her lips, and I hate it. I don't want her
sympathy.
Especially not this weekend.
I wave a hand. “Enough about that. I'm so happy for you, Harper.”
Her sad smile turns radiant just like that.
“Thank you. I'm so happy for me too. And I'm so happy you two have
already met,” she says, nodding toward the guy standing behind us.
“Glad you found it,” Collin says, clapping him on the shoulder and
bringing me back to reality.
“Almost didn't.” The guy smirks when he says it, and it's like they're in
on some secret the rest of us don't know.
“Why is it good we've met?” I ask, looking around at the three of them,
not understanding how they all know one another.
“This is Collin's teammate who you'll be walking down the aisle with,
duh. Now come on,” she says, looping her arm in mine and dragging me
toward the building. “You guys are late and we have some practicing to do.”
This is my partner for the weekend?
This guy? The one I just punched in the face?
He's a pro-hockey player?
I glance back at him, watching as he slowly ambles up the stairs behind
us, that smug grin he can't seem to wipe off firmly in place.
Fuck my life.

LOWELL
Collin is lucky he's like a brother to me because otherwise, there is no way
in hell I would ever put up with this shit.
First I have to spend the entire weekend with my teammates in the offseason. Don't get me wrong, I love these guys, but I also love my me time.
And now he's telling me I have to spend the weekend with the girl who
punched me in the face just minutes ago.
Sure, I was in the wrong for pulling into the parking lot with my music
blaring like a maniac, but I don't think that warranted being hit in the face
by a stranger.
Especially not in the parking lot of my own business.
I glance over at my attacker. She has her head thrown back laughing at
something Emilia, the team's social media manager, is saying.
Looking at her now without all the mascara running down her face and
the crazed look in her eyes, it's clear I should have picked up on the fact
that this is Harper's sister. It's obvious they're related. Their faces are the
same shape, and they have the same full lips, the same pert nose. Hell, even
their hair color is the same shade of brown. They look like they could be
twins instead of having the two-year age gap I know is between them.
And how do I know all this information? Collin. The dude never shuts
up about his wife-to-be. But I suppose that's to be expected when you find
your person.
I thought I had found my person once upon a time. Oh, how wrong I
was. So very, very, embarrassingly wrong.
Hollis must feel my gaze because she glances over at me, and that smile
she was wearing is replaced by a deep frown in a matter of milliseconds.
The change is so drastic it makes me laugh. Which of course pisses her off
even more. It's like she's annoyed by my mere existence.
She glares at me, and my smile pulls even wider. I chuckle when she
turns her back to me completely.
We did several run-throughs for the wedding tomorrow, and each time I
had to link arms with Hollis, she grew stiffer and stood farther away from
me. It didn't take long for Harper to pick up on it, and she pulled Hollis
aside. I have no idea what they talked about, but when we ran through it for
the fourth time, it was much smoother.
Now that we're done practicing, Hollis is back to being ice cold. Funny,
because I should be the one who is upset given the circumstances of our
introduction.
“Having fun yet?”
My teammate Rhodes slides up next to me. He takes a sip from his
champagne glass, then lets out a long sigh like he's as exhausted by all of
this as I am. Which is even funnier knowing that out of all of us, he's the
one who has been married the most times.
I glance at the scar on his face, and I momentarily feel bad because even
after all this time of knowing him, it's still the first thing my eyes drift to. I
guess when you have a scar from right under your eye down your cheek and
slicing through your lips and it's as marred and jagged as his, it's kind of
expected.
If he notices, he doesn't say anything. Instead, he takes another drink,
looking out at the small crowd in front of us. There aren't many people,
only around twenty-five, but it feels like a hundred with how badly I don't
want to be here right now.
I grunt in response to his question.
He laughs. “You look like you're having about as much fun as I do in
crowds.”
One of our best defensemen on the Carolina Comets, Adrian Rhodes
isn't exactly known for being social. He's as notorious for skipping out on
interviews as he is for his stats on the ice. He doesn't do press, and he
certainly doesn't do crowds.
Hell, before his wife, Ryan, came along, we had to fight tooth and nail
to get the dude to go have a beer with us—his own teammates—after a
game. While we do still have to coax him into coming out more often than
not, there have been many times in the last year that he's said yes without
us prodding too hard.
But still, the dude hates crowds. For me, it's not so much the crowds;
it's just the event.
“I'm just glad Ryan didn't make me wear a tie. I get enough of that
during the season.”
Fuck, he's telling me. If I could burn my suit and tie, I would. I know
some guys love dressing up for games, but I am not one of them. Which is
exactly why I wore a pair of dark jeans and a button-up shirt. I already have
to dress up for this event tomorrow. I'm not doing it today too.
“Man, I'm glad we never had to go through all this formal shit for our
wedding.”
“I mean, to be fair, you did get married in Vegas…twice.”
He grins like he's thinking back on it. “And I'd do it again in a
heartbeat.”
“Even the first time?”
“Especially the first time. It led me to Ryan.”
I grimace at the lovey-doveyness of it all.
Rhodes takes notice and chuckles at my discomfort. “You know, it's
kind of funny that as a guy who hates relationships so much, you co-own
one of the hottest wedding venues with your sister.”
“Trust me, I see the irony in it as well.”
Not too long ago, my younger sister, Stacie, came to me with the idea of
opening a wedding venue next to the brewery we own together in my
hometown, which just happens to be about two hours from the arena I play
at.
I'll admit, it took some convincing for me to be on board with the
wedding venue idea. We're a brewery—why did we need to host weddings?
But when it became clear to me that it was something she was passionate
about, I thought it was fair that I support her. After all, she gave up a lot of
her childhood for my dreams and aspirations of playing professional
hockey.
So, we tossed up a new building and connected the two with a huge
outdoor seating area that's easily transformed into the perfect outdoor
reception setting.
I never thought I'd be hosting my teammate's wedding here, but Harper
fell in love with the place not even knowing it was my business since it's
not really something I advertise. I'm more of a silent co-owner, especially
during the hockey season. She was more than thrilled when I gave them the
friends and family discount—meaning I didn't charge them a dime—on the
venue. So, for them to be torturing me with all this other bullshit is really
unfair.
It's nothing against Collin and Harper. I'm happy for them. What they
have seems to be one of the rare occurrences—something real. Just like
what Ryan and Rhodes have.
No, my problem has to do with my disdain of relationships in general.
Love and me? We don't get along too well.
My sister thinks I'm being stubborn and that I need to just move on.
That's easy for her to say. She wasn't the one who was tricked into
believing she got a woman pregnant, proposed, announced to the world he
proposed, then found out it was all fake and nothing but a trap to get his
pro-hockey money.
A trap I fell right fucking into too.
The worst part? I actually thought I was in love with her…and I know I
was in love with the baby that never existed. I didn't just mourn the loss of
my relationship; I mourned the loss of a future that was never really mine,
and I am not about to hurl myself into another relationship. Getting burned
like that once was enough for me, thanks.
So I keep it light and casual in that department. The one-timer isn't just
good for the ice. It's pretty much how I get by.
“Okay, serious question, did anyone else notice the lack of babes at this
thing?”
We both turn toward Miller, who is scanning the crowd with a frown.
“First”—Rhodes smacks him across the back of his head—“no. Stop
trying to pick up women. Second, don't say babes. It's weird.”
“First, ow. You ass.” Miller rubs at the spot. “Second, I'm not trying to
pick up women right now. I'm just scouting.”
“Scouting?”
“For tomorrow,” he elaborates.
I roll my eyes. “You're exhausting.”
“And horny. So very horny. Lonely too.”
“Yeah, but I'm sure your right palm isn't,” Rhodes comments, not even
bothering to hide his smirk behind his champagne flute.
“Exactly! That's my problem.” He holds said hand up. “It's getting
tired. I'm pretty sure it's calloused—look!”
“I'd really rather not discuss your masturbation issues, Miller,” I say to
him.
“Would you rather talk about why you were late? Were you the one
masturbating?”
I glare at him. “Hardly.”
Not that I'd ever admit as much to the idiot, but I can sympathize with
him. My dick has seen my palm more than it's seen a pussy in the last year
or so.
But that's been by choice. After winning the Cup, I wanted to take
another run at it, and I knew I couldn't get us far if I didn't focus. So that's
what I did. I played hockey and took every other distraction off the table.
Clearly, it wasn't enough. We got knocked out of the playoffs in the
second round.
But I don't want to dwell on that now.
“Why were you late though?” Rhodes asks. “Didn't want to come?”
Bingo. “Even I beat you here, which never happens. You're always first.”
He's right; it's not like me to flake on stuff. I'm usually the first on the
ice in the morning and the last to leave every day and after every game.
“Got held up in the parking lot.”
He cocks a questioning brow. “The parking lot? Here?”
“Yep. Don't you know I'm trespassing?”
I feel like I should be more upset about the whole encounter, but
thinking back on how utterly insane Hollis looked standing outside my
window with mascara streaks running down her cheeks, I can't help but
laugh.
“On your own property?” Rhodes asks, looking just as confused as I
was when I was accosted.
“Apparently so.”
“That sounds…”
“Completely crazy? Yeah, I know. Tell that to the nut who assaulted me
in the parking lot.”
“Someone assaulted you in the parking lot?”
“Not just any someone. Harper's sister.”
Miller—in his typical dramatic fashion—gasps. “No way.”
“Yep. Clocked me right in the face.”
“So, I know she's supposed to be your girl and all, so you get first dibs,
but does this mean you don't have a chance with her? Is she available,
then?” Rhodes and I both give him an incredulous look. “What? She's hot!”
“Hot or not, she's crazy.”
He shrugs. “Crazy can be fun.”
“What is wrong with you? I just told you she assaulted me.”
“Oh my gosh! I did not assault you! It was an accident!”
I turn around to find Hollis standing there. She has one hand on her hip,
her lips pressed tightly together as she stares down at me with eyes full of
ire.
I lied earlier when I said she's dressed like she has a stick up her ass.
Yeah, sure, her dress covers all of her assets and then some, but it definitely
hugs her in all the right places too. It's sexy in an understated sort of way,
especially now that she's washed her makeup off.
Frankly, she's beautiful, and it's distracting as hell.
And annoying, because I don't want to find her attractive. She's crazy.
Huh. Maybe Miller has a point about crazy after all…
“You really did hit him?” Miller holds his hand up to high-five her.
“Nice! He probably deserved it.”
She ignores his hand, keeping her eyes on me. “I obviously didn't know
who you were.”
“And you didn't bother trying to find out either. You just assumed I
didn't belong. Why? Because of my vehicle?”
“That thing is a total piece of shit,” Rhodes chimes in.
I'll admit it—my truck isn't in the best of shape. But it's the same damn
truck I've had since the moment I turned sixteen, and I'm not ready to let
her die yet. Even though I can afford a better vehicle—hell, I could afford
multiple better ones—I can't give her up. She's been good to me, and I feel
like I owe it to her to keep her going.
“I—I…” she sputters. “Well, I—”
“You what? Judged me? Jumped to conclusions?”
“No! Yes!”
“Well, which is it? No or yes?”
“Both.”
“Tell me, do you assault everyone who you don't know based on the
conclusions you've jumped to? You know, come to think of it, there was a
lot of force behind that punch. Seemed kind of premeditated to me.”
Her eyes narrow, her hand balling up at her side. “Oh, trust me, if I'd
meant to hit you, you'd know it.”
I don't know this woman at all, but something tells me she just might be
telling the truth. She might appear to be a little buttoned up, but from that
spitfire attitude she showed out in the parking lot, I'd say she's anything
but.
“Somehow I doubt that, darlin',” I find myself saying just to taunt her.
The way her jaw works back and forth is a sign she doesn't like that one
bit.
Now, normally, I have really good reflexes. You don't become an NHL
player without them. I can usually read people really well. Again, prohockey player. It's just a skill set that comes with playing the game.
But nowhere, not once in all my years of training and playing a sport
professionally, have I ever been prepared for this moment.
As if it's happening in slow motion and I'm in the audience watching it
unfold on the big screen, Hollis lifts her champagne flute…and splashes the
liquid directly in my face.
Miller and Rhodes jump back just in time, leaving me standing there
soaked and pissed off.
Hollis takes a step toward me, her eyes cloudy and angrier than I've
seen them yet—which is saying something. When she pushes up on her
toes, our noses are nearly touching.
It's then that I notice one key difference between her and Harper—their
eyes.
Pools of dark blue filled with rage stare back at me.
But it's not just any dark blue, and it's not just rage. There's a deep
lonely sadness swimming in there too.
For a moment, a part of me forgets everything that happened in the
parking lot and that I'm covered in champagne. For a moment, all I feel is
complete empathy for her. I know what that deep sadness feels like, and I
don't like that she's feeling it.
“I. Am not. Your. Darlin'.”
Hollis spins on her heel and stomps away, the entire room bouncing
their eyes between me and her retreating back, trying to figure out what the
hell just happened.
“Dude,” Rhodes hisses in my ear. “What the fuck did you do to her?”
I run my hand down my face to wipe it clean, shaking the excess
champagne off my fingers. A few guests glare at me for getting droplets on
them, but I don't really care. Apparently, I have a bigger problem.
“I think I just pissed off my date for the weekend.”
“Yeah, I'd say.” He lets out a humorless laugh. “Incoming.”
He dips his head toward the other side of the room where Collin is
charging my way as his soon-to-be wife beelines for the exit, running after
her sister. He doesn't stop until he's directly in front of me, his nose flaring
with anger. I've only seen him like this one other time, and that time, he
landed himself in handcuffs.
I hold my hand up to stop him. “Save it. I'm not in the mood.”
He steps toward me anyway, ignoring my hand. “I don't give two shits
if you're in the mood or not. I also don't care what that was all about. All I
care about is that you fucking fix it and you fucking fix it fast.”
With a sigh, I give him one terse nod, then head in the same direction
Harper and Hollis went, trying my best to ignore all the curious stares and
murmurs from the other guests.
Part of me understands his frustration with me. If somebody came to my
sister's wedding and screwed it up like I just did, I'd probably react the
same way.
But none of this is actually my fault. I'm not the one who was acting
like a crazy person. I'm not the one who was judging whether or not
somebody belonged here. I'm not the one who was hitting. I'm not the one
who threw champagne in somebody's face.
Okay, fine. I poked and prodded a bit, but still. Little dramatic, no?
I step into the hallway, and my eyes immediately go to two figures at
the end of it. Hollis and Harper are huddled together, Harper with her arms
around her big sister, consoling her. Hollis is crying, that much is obvious.
Her shoulders are shaking with her sobs, and they aren't exactly quiet.
I'm starting to suspect I had very little to do with her outburst in both
the parking lot and just now. It makes me feel bad because something else is
clearly going on.
The strangest urge to walk down the hall and comfort her comes over
me, and it stops me dead in my tracks.
My shoes squeak against the floor, and Harper's eyes meet mine at the
sound. She narrows her eyes, shaking her head to stop me from coming any
closer. She pulls away from Hollis, then mutters something to her that I
can't quite make out from here. Whatever she says, it has Hollis nodding
and wiping at her eyes.
Hollis gives her sister one last squeeze before rushing out the front door
without so much as a backward glance. Harper watches her go for a
moment before turning on me and stalking back down the hallway with the
angriest look I've ever seen from her. She only stands at around five foot
five, tiny compared to my six-foot-three stature, but fuck is she scarylooking right now.
I open my mouth to apologize to her, but when she holds her hand up, I
snap it closed.
“Whatever apology or dispute you're about to send my way, save it for
Hollis tomorrow. She's going through a lot right now and doesn't need any
more drama tonight.” She takes another step toward me. “But if I find out
tomorrow that you did not apologize to my sister, there will be hell to pay,
and I watch a lot of horror movies, so I know a lot of good places to hide a
body where they won't find you for years.”
I don't really doubt that she's telling the truth.
So, I nod. “Understood.”
“Good. Now let's get back to the party. For, you know, my wedding
tomorrow.”
With one last glare, she brushes past me.
And I know this long weekend just got a whole lot longer.

HOLLIS
“Oh my gosh, you should have seen the way you two walked down the
aisle. You were so stiff! I still can't believe you hit him.”
“He deserved it! You could have warned me about him, you know,” I
gripe to Emilia as we slide up to one of the many bars this place has.
“Oh, come on. He's not that bad,” she says. “In fact, he's actually really
nice. Probably one of the nicer guys on the team if I'm being honest. He's
always game for charity stuff, and he's so good with all the kids.”
“You sound like you have a crush on him.”
“Ha. Hardly. I mean is the man insanely hot? Yes. Obviously. Duh. But
you don't want to mess around with hockey players.” She says it like she's
speaking from experience, and I have a feeling she is.
Emilia moved out here a couple of years ago after she discovered her
boyfriend was living a double life with her and the neighbor next door.
Much like me, she had to bail. Though I missed her, I couldn't blame her
for doing it. Especially not when she was offered a social media manager
position with a professional hockey team.
The very first weekend she lived here, she had a two-night stand with a
mystery guy, and something in my gut tells me it was one of the players she
works with, though she won't confirm it.
“Wait…it's not him, is it?”
“Uh…no.” Though her cheeks flush a bright red. “Order me a wine, will
you? I'm going to run to the bathroom really quick.”
I plop down onto a stool and sigh. My feet are killing me, and I want
nothing more than to run a hot bath, then soak in it for hours.
“Long day?” the bartender asks, setting a napkin in front of me.
“The longest.”
I woke up this morning with an awful headache, no doubt from all the
crying I did yesterday. Then when I checked my bank account—like I do
every morning because I'm responsible like that—I realized somebody had
made not one, not two, but three purchases on my card without my
authorization. Guess who got to spend the morning on the phone with the
bank dealing with that? Me.
Then the coffee I had delivered for room service—a splurge on its own
—didn't come with cream, and when I called down to the front desk to
request some, they told me they were out. Which meant I was stuck with
black coffee, and I hate black coffee.
That was all before I even got out of bed.
I also had to deal with my sister freaking out about last-minute things,
my mother freaking out about last-minute things, and everyone else
freaking out about last-minute things. And don't even get me started on the
pitying looks I've been getting from everyone who knows I just got
divorced.
It has been an emotionally taxing day on so many levels.
The bartender chuckles like he's in on the joke, even though he has no
idea how long of a day it really was for me. “What can I get for you?”
“Do you have chocolate milk?”
I don't know why I say it. I had every intention of getting drunk tonight,
but wine doesn't sound appealing right now.
He lifts his brows, then shoots a glance down the bar. “Do we have
chocolate milk tonight, boss?”
Boss?
I turned on my stool to find my least favorite person in the world right
now.
Actually, probably my second least favorite person in the world right
now—fuck that asshole who stole my credit card information.
I hold my breath, waiting for him to say something asinine because
that's apparently the only thing that can come out of his mouth.
But to my surprise, he doesn't. He just looks at the bartender and nods.
“Yeah, we do.”
The bartender taps the counter twice and tells me he'll be right back,
then takes off. I turn to thank him for the drink, but the words die on my
tongue when I realize he's getting up and moving two stools down to sit
next to me.
Like right next to me. So close I can smell him, and he smells divine.
Almost like a hint of something woodsy with just a note of orange.
I hate that I like it.
He doesn't say anything as he takes a seat, his warmth wrapping around
me like a blanket I didn't ask for. Somehow, he seems so much taller sitting
beside me than he did standing next to me. I didn't think my heels gave me
that much height, but I feel so small sitting beside him right now.
“You do know your sister and Collin paid for an open bar, right?”
“I'm aware.”
He lifts a brow, waiting for me to elaborate. I don't because all I can
hear is Thad's voice in my head. He used to get so mad at me when I would
order at his work functions because it was “embarrassing.”
“Chocolate milk, Hollis? Really? You're an adult—adults don't drink
chocolate milk. Grow up.”
But he never knew I love chocolate milk so much because it reminds me
of early mornings with my father. He'd get up and have a pot of coffee and
read the newspaper. He'd pour me a glass of chocolate milk and hand me
the crossword section. We'd sit quietly at the kitchen table while he read
and I worked.
It's always been a comfort thing for me. Whenever I'm in a high-stress
situation, I have a glass of chocolate milk to calm my nerves. It helps take
me back to simpler times, times when I was young and hopeful and didn't
realize how cruel the world can be.
Before my husband turned out to be no better than any other man in my
life and cheated on me.
“Okay,” he says, and—shockingly—drops the subject. He lifts his own
beverage of choice—it looks like a cocktail of some sort—and takes a
healthy sip.
We sit next to each other quietly for a long time. How long, I have no
idea, but it would feel too wrong to ask the guy to go away after what he
just did for me with the chocolate milk.
Besides, I guess I owe him after yesterday. I try not to cringe thinking
about it. That was not one of the finer moments in my life.
I have no idea what happened. My emotions got the best of me. I was
already stressed heading into the situation, and he and his smug attitude
didn't make it any better.
“Look, about yesterday,” he says as if he can read my mind. “I'm—”
I hold my hand up, stopping him. “There's no need to apologize. I'm the
one who should be saying sorry. I was completely out of line on many
accounts, and I regret that. I've been going through a tough time, but I
shouldn't have taken that out on you.”
“I wasn't going to apologize.”
I jerk my head back. “Excuse me?”
“I wasn't going to apologize. I was just going to say I'm sorry you're
going through whatever it is you're going through, but I forgive you for
your actions yesterday.”
Oh man, this guy is rich.
“Are you serious?”
“Are you serious? Because as I remember it, I was doing nothing but
minding my own business yesterday. You were the one who attacked me.
Both times.”
“You prodded.”
“Okay, fine,” he says with a shrug. “I concede to that.”
“And I concede that I might have been a little…”
“Crazy? Erratic? Completely fucking batshit?”
I narrow my eyes at him, even though he's not wrong. I was the one
who attacked yesterday—literally, even though I didn't intend to. But he's
the one who provoked me. He should take the blame too.
I'm too tired to keep arguing and care though.
I blow out a long breath. “Look, it's obvious we got off on the wrong
foot, and yeah, maybe I was a little”—I emphasize the word so he knows
I'm not the only one at fault here—“crazy yesterday, but can we start over?”
He eyes me carefully, those captivating green eyes of his bouncing back
and forth between my own blue ones. Watching me. Waiting. I don't know
what for, but his penetrating gaze is intense enough to make me shift in my
seat. I don't like how it brings me neither comfort nor discomfort.
If anything, I feel seen for the first time in a long time.
After what seems like forever, he gives me a slow nod. “Yeah, we can
start over.” He lifts his drink just as the bartender sets a glass of chocolate
milk in front of me. “To starting over?”
“To starting over.”
We clink our glasses together.
I take a sip of my chocolate milk as he downs the rest of his drink, then
motions to the bartender for another.
“You didn't shrink away from me after the ceremony,” he says, running
a hand through his hair. “I'm impressed. And impressed that you didn't hit
me or throw champagne on me.”
“Well, the night is still young,” I say.
“That's fair.” He clears his throat and runs a hand over the five o'clock
shadow on his face. “I guess I should say I'm sorry. I was a little…
antagonistic myself.”
“A little?”
“Okay, a lot. I'm just…I'm not really into weddings.”
“Not into weddings? Don't you own this venue?”
“Co-own.” He nods. “With my sister, actually. She's the one who
wanted to use the extra property for weddings. I thought we should just
build an activity area or open space for food trucks to come by, but she was
right about the numbers for a wedding venue. It's much more lucrative than
any of that.”
Ah, so he's one of those guys—always about the money.
Thad was like that too. He wanted the latest and greatest, and he wanted
it before anyone else could have it.
“Yes, I'm sure you're hurting for money, Mr. NHL Superstar.”
“Oh, so you do know my name, then. I was starting to wonder.”
I roll my eyes. “I know your name, Lowell.”
Even though the room is dimly lit, I don't miss the way his eyes flare
when I say his name for the first time, testing it on my lips and his ears.
“Cameron.”
“Huh?”
“My first name—it's Cameron.”
I stick my hand out toward him. “Nice to meet you, Cameron. I'm
Hollis.”
His eyes spark again as he clasps my hand. “Nice to meet you, Hollis.”
A shiver races down my spine as my name rolls off his lips. He says it
like he's cursing it and kissing it all at once.
We don't pull our hands back immediately. In fact, it's safe to say we sit
there holding each other's palms for far longer than is appropriate.
I can't seem to make myself pull away, and apparently, he can't either. I
don't get it, and based on the way his brows sink lower and lower by the
second, he doesn't either.
The bartender slides a new drink in front of Lowell, and we finally
break the contact.
“So,” I say, rubbing my hand against my thigh. I'm not sure if I'm
wiping his touch off or trying to savor it. “How exactly does an NHL star
who doesn't like weddings come to own a wedding venue?”
“Not just any wedding venue—a wedding venue and a brewery.” He
shrugs. “Just something fun to invest in. I don't really have much of a say
around here. My sister is the real boss.”
I don't know why, but I like that he doesn't take all the credit for the
business as most men would. I like that he focuses the attention on his
sister. Though I'm sure being an NHL player, he gets plenty of attention. He
doesn't need this too.
“I suppose that makes sense, then. But if you're not into weddings, why
did you give the approval?”
“Because it was what she wanted.” He says it so matter of fact, and I
like that too.
“I see. And you don't like weddings because…”
“And you were crying in your car yesterday because…” he challenges.
Well, shit. He has me there.
Based on the way he smiles, he knows it too. He lifts his drink to his
mouth, still staring at me expectantly like I'm going to spill my guts with
just one glance. Not a chance.
“Gosh, I feel so much better. I had to pee throughout all those speeches.
Yours was great, by the way.” Emilia plops down on the stool next to me.
“Oh, good, you ordered me wine.”
Except I didn't order her wine. I forgot about it the moment I sat down
and realized Lowell was here.
I glance around, trying to figure out who it came from, and I don't miss
the way the older guy at the other end of the bar is staring intently this way,
his eyes firmly on Emilia. When he finally peels his eyes from hers and
realizes I'm looking at him, he flicks his gaze away.
Emilia notices none of this. She just picks up her glass, downing half of
it in one go before nodding toward mine. “They have chocolate milk here?”
“I made sure they got her some.”
“Oh, hey, Lowell. Didn't see you there.”
“Emilia.” His eyes bounce between us. “You two know one another?”
“You could say that.” Emilia elbows me lightly, grinning. “We've
known each other since the first grade—the first day of first grade to be
exact. Hollis was really shy back then and got so nervous on the bus ride to
school that she threw up in her lunch sack and didn't tell anyone about it.
When lunchtime came around, I felt bad and shared half of my peanut
butter and jelly with her. We've been best friends since.”
I try not to react to the story because even though I was just a kid, it's
still embarrassing.
“Huh,” Lowell says. “It's hard to imagine Hollis as shy.”
“I can imagine it is for you. Heard she clocked you pretty good.”
“Sure did. She's a fighter, that one.”
“That one is sitting right here,” I interrupt, looking pointedly at Emilia,
who just smiles back at me. “Come on, let's go dance.”
“But you hate dancing.”
“No, I don't.”
“Yes, you do. You barely even danced at your wed—” She stops
midsentence, snapping her mouth shut, realizing maybe right now isn't a
good time to bring that up. “You're right. You love to dance. Let's go
dance.” She guzzles the rest of her wine in one drink, then hops off the
stool. “Besides, they're playing Queen, and you love Queen.”
The moment she says it, my eyes find Lowell's, and his green gaze is
dancing with laughter.
“Love them, huh?” he says. “Thought they were—what was it you
called them again? Shitty?”
Emilia gasps. “She would never! She's obsessed with them.”
“That so, Hollis?”
I shrug, and he shakes his head with a grin I find way too charming as
Emilia drags me away.
For the first time since I met him, I'm not so sure I want to get away
from him.

LOWELL
I feel like a fucking creep right now.
I've been sitting at the bar for the last twenty minutes just watching
Hollis and Emilia dance out on the floor. They're laughing about something
—what, I don't know—but I can't help but notice that this version of Hollis
is the exact opposite of the version I met yesterday.
Honestly, she's confusing as hell.
And intriguing.
I hate that she's intriguing because it makes me want to get to know her.
I don't want to want to get to know her.
“You look like hammered dog shit.”
“Thank you. I was hoping someone would notice how hard I worked to
look good today.”
Smith laughs, taking a seat on the stool next to me. “This have anything
to do with the fight you started last night?”
“One, it wasn't a fight. Two, how do you even know about that? You
weren't there.”
He lifts a shoulder. “Word gets around.”
“Miller?” His grin is answer enough, and I shake my head. “Fucking
rookie.” I toss back the rest of my cocktail and motion to the bartender for
another. “It's not last night. It's just…other shit.”
“Other shit like that girl you're staring at?”
My eyes drift back out toward the dance floor in the middle of the
courtyard. Hollis has her arms up as she shimmies her ass from side to side.
Honestly, she's a horrible dancer. Zero rhythm and doesn't know how to
move her body at all.
But for some reason, I still can't look away.
“Interesting,” he mutters, and I turn my attention back to him.
“What is?”
“Nothing. I just haven't seen you like this in a while.”
“Like what?”
“Captivated.”
I scoff. “I'm not captivated. I'm…”
“Interested?”
I glare at him. “Intrigued is all.”
“Right.”
“Dude, it's nothing.”
He holds his hands up in innocence. “I didn't say it was.”
“Your tone sure as shit did.”
“And your insistence that it's nothing sure as shit does too.”
“Because it's nothing. You know how I feel about relationships.”
When everything went down with Celine several years ago, Smith was
there to help me pick up the pieces and put myself back together. I was still
finding my way with the Comets at the time, and Smith took me under his
wing and helped me get my head screwed back on so the whole mess
wouldn't affect my performance on the ice too badly. He said I was too
young and had too promising of a career to let something like that get me
down and get me sent back to the AHL.
So, I adopted his philosophy on life—hockey comes first no matter
what. I've lived by that rule for the last several years and it's kept me on
track. Because of it, I got to hoist the Stanley Cup over my head, and that's
what this is all about, isn't it?
“And you get it—we have the same outlook on that,” I say.
He runs a hand over his jaw, scratching at the neatly trimmed beard he
keeps. “I don't know. I'm starting to think I might have been wrong about
that after all.”
I snap my head back, surprised by his words. “Oh man, tell me you
aren't going soft on me too. It's bad enough hearing Collin and Rhodes
going on and on about their wives. Don't tell me they got to you too.”
He lifts a shoulder. “Nah. Just…getting older. Starting to realize the
things that matter and that don't.”
“Hockey matters.”
“Hockey always matters. But…some things matter more.”
I follow his line of sight out onto the dance floor, and unless I am
completely crazy, he's looking right at Hollis' dance partner.
I have questions—so many questions—but much like me, Smith is a
private guy. That's something we agree upon and respect about one another.
I can't help but wonder though if Emilia may just be the cause of the
shift I've seen in him over the last two years. The timeline does add up…
“Ignore me,” he says, interrupting my thoughts. “It's just weddings.
Sometimes they get you thinking, you know? Of things you might be
missing.”
A sharp twinge in my chest pulls my attention.
“Missing? What could be missing?”
He gives me a look that tells me I know exactly what he's referring to,
but I ignore it.
He means love. I don't miss love because I don't need it. I don't need it
because I've had it and it sucks. All I need is hockey…and maybe a few
one-night stands. That's it.
“Anyway.” He pushes off the bar, then claps me on the back. “I'm going
to go stop Miller from feeling up Ryan's grandmother. He's getting handsy,
and I don't trust the rookie.”
I laugh because it's probably not a bad idea. To say Miller is a bit
unpredictable would be an understatement.
He turns away and takes two steps before spinning right back around
toward me. I lift a brow at him in question.
“Ask her to dance.”
“Ask who to dance?”
“The girl you can't take your eyes off of. Trust me, if I could ask
somebody to dance right now, I would.” He glances back at the dance floor
longingly before giving his head a shake and retreating into the crowd.
I peel my eyes away from his retreating back and look out at the crowd
on the floor. Hollis is dancing right in the center, throwing her arms about,
having the time of her life.
She looks ridiculous. Happy.
And for the briefest moment, I want to be out there with her having fun
too.
The song slowly slips into a much milder tempo. Emilia motions toward
the bar, but Hollis waves her off, swaying back and forth slowly by herself
in the middle of the crowd.
I don't know why I do it. It could be Smith's words repeating in my
head, or it could be because she looks so awkward swaying back and forth
alone. Either way, I let my feet carry me forward.
I don't stop until I'm standing right in front of her. Her eyes widen,
surprised to see me. I'm surprised by it too.
I don't know who makes the first move, but one second she's standing
four feet away from me, and the next she's in my arms, no longer dancing
awkwardly alone.
We're slowly moving around the dance floor, completely coordinated,
and it feels comfortable doing this with her. Maybe it's just because I
haven't been this close to someone in a long time, but her body feels good
next to mine. Soft…warm.
“You're really good at this,” she mutters quietly after several long silent
seconds.
“Lessons.”
“Huh?”
“I took dance lessons. Ballet too. A lot of hockey players do. It helps us
move better on the ice, increases our flexibility and agility.”
She tips her head to the side. “That is…unexpected.”
“Plus, it helps us score points with the ladies.”
“Is that something you need help with? Scoring points with the ladies?”
“I don't know—you tell me. How am I doing?”
“Scale of one to ten?” I nod. “I'd say a solid four.”
“A four?”
“A solid four.”
“Ah, yes, solid makes it so much better.”
“I mean, it really does. You could be a soft four, which is really more
like a three.”
“Out of ten?”
She nods. “Afraid so.”
“And how does one score a three out of ten exactly?”
She motions behind me, so I swing us around, wanting to see what she's
looking at.
“You see that guy dancing with the old lady? That is a solid three. He
definitely gets points for yucking it up with the elderly, but he loses a lot of
points because it looks desperate, like he's trying way too hard to impress
someone.”
“You do know that's my teammate, right?”
“Hey, I don't make the rules, I just relay them.”
“I'd say your scoring is spot-on because well, I know Miller and he is
definitely trying too hard, but I'm still confused how he is a solid three
while I am a solid four. I've not danced with one old lady tonight, and I
certainly don't look desperate. How am I only one point ahead of him?”
“Ah, see that's where it gets kind of tricky. You haven't danced with any
old ladies tonight, so you definitely lose points there. You've also not
danced with anyone tonight, so you lose more points there. In fact, all
you've done is sit at the bar skulking, so again, you lose more points. At
that point, you're a one.”
“How do you know what I've been doing all night?”
Her cheeks turn pink like she's admitted to something she shouldn't
have.
“That's not the point,” she mutters. “The point is the points.”
“Right. And I have…one? For not being gentlemanly enough and being
an antisocial asshole, but also not looking desperate?”
She shakes her head. “Four.”
“How do I gain the other three?”
“Snazzy suit and scruffy sexy five o'clock shadow combined with your
lonely hearts club attitude giving you this whole I'm broken please fix me
vibe have brought you up a few.”
“Let's definitely circle back to that snazzy suit and scruffy sexy five
o'clock shadow.”
“Ah, see, you spoke, so you're back down to a three. You are much
cuter when you don't speak.”
“Duly noted. Don't speak—got it.”
“Look at that, already down to a two.”
“Well, since I'm losing points by the minute, I'd like to address the
whole lonely hearts club thing. I can assure you I am not out here looking
for a lover or a friend.”
“Really? This is a wedding after all. Isn't that what people do at
weddings? They hook up and make one-time bad choices they'll regret later
because they're sad and lonely because someone else is getting their
happily ever after when they're a freshly divorced almost-thirty-year-old
starting their life over.”
I lift a pointed brow at her. “It sounds like you're speaking from
experience there.”
It would make sense though—the reason she was crying in her car, the
reason she's been crying all weekend, the reason her emotions seem to be
all over the place.
If she's freshly divorced, this weekend has to hurt for her.
The only indication that I might be right is the way her eyes flit away
from mine just before that same sadness I saw before seeps back into her
gaze, and it makes me want to hold her closer and wrap my arms around her
to form a protective layer so nobody can ever hurt her again. Whoever
broke her like this, I want to break them.
More than that, I want to see her happy and carefree again. I'd do
anything to get that back.
I tug her closer until her body is flush against mine and drop my lips to
her ear, trying not to get distracted by how good she smells when I'm
standing this close to her. Her heart rate picks up at our proximity, and I can
hear her breaths coming in sharper by the second.
“Tell me, Hollis, are you looking for a lover or friend?”
She gulps. It's so audible I hear that too.
She tips her head back, staring up at me, her tongue darting out to wet
her lips. “Are you offering?”
It's my turn to be surprised because I did not expect her to say that.
“That depends… Which one are you looking for?”
She laughs, though there's no humor to it, and slowly shakes her head.
“Neither. I have no business looking for either. Not right now.”
“Everyone deserves a friend, Hollis. Even you.” I tip my head down
until we are eye to eye. “Especially you.”
Another stuttered breath.
Her eyes flash to my lips, then to my eyes, back to my lips once again.
If I were to move just an inch, our mouths would be touching. I'd be
kissing Hollis, and I don't think I would be stopping anytime soon.
She opens her mouth to respond, but whatever she's about to say is cut
off by a shutter sound.
I glare at the intrusion.
“Sorry,” the wedding photographer says, not looking the least bit sorry
at all. “You two were just…wow. The chemistry was sparking—I had to
capture it.”
He shakes the camera at us and snaps a few more pictures before
sauntering off. The moment has passed.
I look back to Hollis, but with how stiff she's grown in my arms, I
already know what's coming before she even says it.
“I have to go.”
She pulls away, and I let her leave.
I don't know how long I stand there watching her walk away, and I
don't know how long I stand there after she's gone.
I do know it takes me all of one second to miss her and to want to hold
her again, and all of two seconds to push away the hundreds of questions
already running through my head. I also know it takes me exactly thirty
steps to get to the door leading outside, and it takes me one minute to find
her in the gardens off to the side of the brewery.
She's sitting on a bench, her shoulders curled forward, head resting in
her hands. It's obvious she's upset, but I don't know what about, and I don't
know why I care so much.
Why the hell do I care so much?
I stalk toward her slowly and quietly, not wanting to startle her, but
somehow, she knows I'm here.
“You can't be my friend, Lowell.”
I take a seat on the bench next to her, not missing the tear that streaks
down her face. “Why not?”
“Because I don't like you.”
I laugh softly, gently reaching for her face and tipping it up so she's
looking at me.
“That's fine. I don't really like you either.”
It's a lie. I do like her. In fact, I can't remember the last time I liked
someone as much as I like her.
I don't want to like her, just like I really don't want to be fighting this
urge to press my lips to hers. I don't want to want to kiss her.
But I do.
I really, really do.
Especially when she's peering up at me with wide eyes filled with
unshed tears. I want to kiss away all the sadness and all the problems she
seems to be having. I want to see her smile again. I want to see her laugh.
Want to taste her.
I think she's just as surprised as I am when I press my lips to hers. It
takes her a moment to respond, like she's waiting for her brain to catch on
to what's happening.
I'm waiting for my brain to catch on to what's happening too.
Why am I kissing her? What the hell am I doing?
I don't know how long we sit like that, unmoving, our lips just resting
together, but it's like all the tension snaps out of the air in a second flat and
we're not sitting still anymore.
Hollis kisses me back like it's the first and last kiss she'll ever get, and I
don't dare waste a second of it, sliding my hand higher into her hair, the
other one going to her hip, dragging her to me until she's straddling my lap.
She lets out a low moan the moment our bodies connect, then settles
against me like she's sitting right where she belongs. Her hands crash into
my hair, tugging me closer and deepening the kiss.
There's no way she doesn't feel my cock through these awful dress
pants, just like there's no mistaking the wet spot pressing against me where
our bodies are meeting.
I drag my hands down her body, running my fingertips along her curves,
memorizing them, making sure I touch every inch of her. I slip my hands
over her ass and under the thin, flowy dress that's bunched around her
waist. My hands slide over her cheeks, and I make a low noise of approval
when I realize she's wearing a thong.
She wrenches her mouth away at the sound, her breaths coming in
ragged as she stares at me with glassy eyes—this time for a reason other
than tears.
“What are we doing, Lowell?”
“I'm being your friend.”
She laughs softly. “I told you I don't want to be your friend. I don't like
you.”
“Fine. Then I'm being your lover.”
She crushes her lip between her teeth. “That's a bad idea.”
“I know.”
“It's a really, really bad idea.”
“I know.”
“This is exactly like one of those bad ideas I was talking about earlier.”
“I know, Hollis.” I squeeze her ass cheeks, dropping my forehead to
hers. “I know.”
She's right. It's a really bad idea. Like the worst possible one ever.
She's my teammate's sister-in-law. Collin would kill me. Not to mention
she's freshly divorced and sleeping with her right now would probably fall
into a morally gray area. She's too emotionally vulnerable.
She's too—
She moves her hips, rubbing herself against my cock, which is still
dying to get out of these dress pants. I grip her hips, tugging her closer
because oh god does she feel good. I run my nose along her jaw, loving the
smell of fresh flowers that seems to be radiating off her.
“What are you doing, Hollis?”
“I don't know.”
“I thought this was a bad decision.”
“It is. Such a bad one.”
“The worst,” I agree, peppering kisses along her neck.
She nods. “Lowell?”
“Hmm?”
She pulls back, our eyes colliding, the moon reflecting off her dark blue
gaze.
If this is the moment she walks away, I want to commit it to memory.
She's gorgeous, her skin slightly sticky from the heat in the air, cheeks
flushed from my kisses, hair a mess from my hands.
Her mouth opens, and she says something I didn't know I needed to
hear so badly.
“I want to make a one-time bad decision with you.”

HOLLIS
I haven't cried since Harper's wedding in July, a little thing I've been
immensely proud of considering how stressful everything has been in my
life.
But today? Today I feel like I want to cry, and it's all because I just had
to get out of my apartment and try working somewhere else for the day.
The moment I walked into the cute little coffee shop I found a couple of
weeks ago, I knew it was a bad idea. The smell in here is…ugh, it's awful
today, and it's making my stomach turn like crazy. It usually smells like a
sweet, delicious baked good, a big reason I come here.
Not today.
Today, the coffee smells burnt, the hazelnut syrup is making me gag,
and if I have to smell one more heated-up egg sandwich, I really may hurl.
I clutch my stomach, willing myself not to puke. I just have a bit more
left to finish writing, and after that I'm golden and can take the weekend
and Monday off.
It's one of the things I love about content writing—the flexibility. I also
love being able to pick up and work anywhere I want. It made packing up
my entire life and moving across the state after the divorce a whole lot
easier to do.
Leaving my mother and trying to get her to understand that I was going
to be just fine on my own? Well, that was a whole different story.
My stomach protests again and I press my hand against it, hoping to
calm it down. I close my eyes, sucking in a few deep breaths so I don't hurl
in the middle of the shop.
Come on, Hollis. Just half an hour longer. You got this.
My phone buzzes against the table, and I'm embarrassed by the way I
rush to check it.
I deflate when I see it's just my mom calling for the fifth time today
even though she knows I'm working. I send her call to voicemail and wait
for my phone to light up with an angry two-minute-long message.
I don't know why I expected it to be anyone different. It's always just
my mom calling, no matter how badly I want it to be someone else.
It's silly for many reasons. One, I never gave him my number. And two,
I shouldn't want him to call.
I knew the score the minute I asked Lowell to take me to bed. It was a
one-time thing. That was it. So me waking up disappointed by the cold spot
next to me the following morning is my own fault.
Him not contacting me is probably for the best. I mean, he is my
brother-in-law's teammate. Getting involved with him—again—wouldn't
be the best decision. I think I'm all tapped out on bad decisions lately.
“Welcome to Cup of Joe's! What can I get you today?”
“I'll have a hazelnut latte, and then I'll take an egg—”
I reach for whatever is nearest to me—which just happens to be my
laptop bag—and I lose all the contents of my stomach. I groan, wiping my
mouth with the back of my hand. I reach blindly for a napkin off my table
and use it to wipe my sweaty forehead.
What the hell is wrong with me?
This is the second time this week I've thrown up. First, it was from bad
leftover pizza—something I never believed was a thing until I saw it
splattered in the toilet. Now, judging by the noodles in the bottom of my
laptop bag, it's the Chinese food I had delivered last night.
“Ugh,” I grumble, tossing the napkin into the now ruined bag and sitting
back against the booth I'm sitting in. “Great. Just what I needed.”
“Are you all right?” someone asks from beside me.
I wave a hand, not really paying attention to them as I close my eyes
and suck in a few deep, steadying breaths because my stomach is turning
again.
I don't know how long I sit like that, but I'm interrupted by a sweet old
voice.
“Here you are, dear.” I peel my eyes open to find a woman who looks
about sixty holding a cup of water out to me. “Drink this. It'll help.”
I reach for the cup and gulp it down without question. My stomach
rumbles again as the water hits it, but it doesn't take long for it to settle
back down.
“Thank you,” I manage to choke out, my throat hurting from the puking.
“And I'm sorry. I'm so embarrassed.”
“It's all right, dear. We've all been there before.”
“We've all puked in public before?”
“Well, most of us mothers have. It's really no big deal.”
Mothers? What is she talking about?
“I'm not a mother.”
“Oh, sorry. I thought…” She waves a wrinkly hand. “Well, never mind
what I thought. It's not important. Do you need another glass of water?”
“Actually, that would be great, thank you. I don't think I can stand the
smell of walking through the place.”
She purses her lips like she wants to say something, then shakes her
head, thinking better of it. She takes the cup from my hands and makes her
way back up to the counter for a refill.
Mothers? I shake my head. Does the old bat think I'm pregnant? Do I
look pregnant? I know I ate a lot of Chinese last night, but I'm not pregnant.
That's not—
“Oh fuck.”
“Pardon?” the old woman says, setting a new cup of water on the table.
“I…”
I have to go.
I have to go now.
I rise from the booth so fast water sloshes out of the cup. I don't even
care that it almost hits my laptop. I'm too busy freaking the fuck out.
“Thank you so much for your help,” I say to the old woman as I pack
up. I toss my laptop bag into the trash, then gather up the rest of my things,
slinging my purse over my shoulder. “But I have to go.”
“Go? Are you sure you're in a condition to go, dear?”
No. “Yes, I'm fine. Thank you again. And sorry.”
“It's fine. I'm—”
I don't hear the rest of her words.
I'm already out the door, flying down the sidewalk to the nearest
drugstore. I go immediately to the family care aisle and grab no less than
six kits. As a last-minute decision, I grab a bag of Solo cups and head for
the bathroom.
I don't even bother paying for anything. I'll do that after. I am way too
freaked out to wait around for someone to ring these up. I need to know
now.
I rip them all open, along with the cups, and hover over the toilet,
willing myself to pee.
After I dip every single stick, I wait.
And watch.
And wait.
And watch.
And wait.
And finally…I cry.
I cry because not one, not two, but all six tests say the same thing.
I'm pregnant.
“I'm preg—”
The word gets stuck in my throat, and I swallow it down.
Once. Twice.
I run my tongue over my lips and try one more time.
“I'm pregn—”
It gets stuck again.
It's the same thing that's been happening for the last three days since I
took those tests. After I cried in the bathroom of the drugstore for twenty
minutes, I paid for the tests and grabbed three more just to be sure, then
took them home and did it all over again. The results were the same on
every single one.
Just like the results were the same this morning when I heard back from
my doctor.
“Congratulations, Ms. Kelly, you're pregnant.”
I threw up in her office at her words. She wasn't too happy about that,
or the fact that I was already nine weeks along and didn't have a clue.
After I explained that I've always had erratic periods and have been
under a lot of stress since my divorce, she understood. She asked if I was
going to tell my ex-husband about the baby.
I laughed until I cried.
Then I puked again.
I still can't believe it.
How the hell did this happen?
I mean, I know how. I just…how?!
We used protection. I know we used protection. I literally watched him
roll the condom on.
But maybe something happened. I mean, we were going at it pretty
hard. Maybe it broke and neither one of us realized it. Maybe it's all my
fault because I genuinely can't remember the last time I took my birth
control pill because I've been too distracted by everything else going on in
my life.
Maybe…
No.
I'm going to drive myself crazy thinking of all the different scenarios.
None of them will change the outcome.
“I'm pregnant.”
I blow out a stuttered breath, completely shocked to my core. I just got
divorced three months ago, and the first guy I sleep with—completely on a
whim—gets me pregnant. What the hell did I do in my past life to deserve
this kind of karma?
I rest my head against my steering wheel only to jump in surprise when
the horn blares. Well, if Harper didn't know I was here before, she
definitely knows now.
Just seconds later, the front door opens, and she stands there, staring at
me, perplexed as to why I'm just sitting in my car, beeping my horn. What
she doesn't know is that I'm sitting in my car beeping my horn because I'm
terrified to walk in there and tell her I'm pregnant…with Lowell's baby.
I'm mostly terrified because she has no idea we slept together.
Just then, Emilia's car pulls into Harper's driveway, and she waves
excitedly at me. I don't even have the heart to wave back.
I asked Harper if we could have a girls' day today at her house. Figured
I might as well let them know the consequences of my actions together
rather than having to repeat it over and over again. Mostly because I'm not
sure I can.
I gather my purse and my confidence and step out of my car just as
Emilia exits hers.
She claps her hands. “I am so excited about today. I need a break before
all those smelly stinky boys start coming back to the rink in a few weeks.”
Just thinking about the rink and hockey players has me wanting to toss
up my breakfast.
Or maybe that's just the morning sickness.
Either way, I hold my hand to my stomach, trying to push the feeling
down. It's something I've been catching myself doing a lot over the last few
days, touching my stomach.
There's a baby inside me. I'm growing human life.
It's not that I never thought I would have a baby or a family. I'd be lying
if I said I didn't want those things with Thad once upon a time. In fact, I
had our whole life planned out pretty much from the start.
We'd get married and it would be just us for a few years so we could
navigate life as newlyweds together without the extra stress of starting a
family. Then, when I turned thirty, I'd stop taking my birth control and we'd
start trying. We'd have been together for eight years at that point. We'd be
ready.
What I never planned on was him cheating on me and throwing
everything away.
Now I'm divorced, single, and pregnant by a man that I hardly know. I
have no idea how Lowell is going to react at all.
Will he be upset? Will he deny that the baby is his? Will he step up and
help me raise it? Do I want him to help me raise a kid? Will he even want
the baby?
Do I want the baby?
The moment the question crosses my mind, I know the answer.
Yes. I want this baby even if Lowell doesn't. Even if he doesn't want to
be part of this child's life, I'm okay with that. I can take care of it on my
own. I'm strong and independent and I—
Oh god, I'm crying again.
“Hey, hey, hey,” Emilia says in a soothing voice, pulling me into her
arms. “What's going on?”
“It's… It's… I-I'm…”
But the words don't come.
“Shhh. It's okay. Let's go inside and get some wine in you. That will
make you feel better.”
That makes me cry even harder because I can't have wine and she
doesn't even know that.
We slip into the house, past Harper, who shoots me a concerned look
full of so many questions. Emilia steers me to the living room and plops me
down on the couch, handing me a box of tissues and a pillow as she takes a
seat next to me to console me.
“I'll grab the wine,” Harper says, heading for the kitchen.
“Stop!”
The word comes out harsher than expected, and she halts in her tracks.
“Stop? Is everything okay? I…” She trails off when I start shaking my
head.
“No, nothing is okay.”
Harper swallows thickly, then glances over at Emilia, who just shrugs.
“Can you sit?” I ask her.
She slowly lowers herself to the couch across from us. “I'm… You're…
You're scaring me, Hollis. What's going on?”
I suck in several deep breaths before finally gathering the courage to
meet my sister's curious gaze. When I do, I have a feeling she already
knows what I'm about to say to her.
“I'm pregnant.”
Emilia gasps next to me.
But not Harper. She doesn't react.
I don't think I like that she doesn't react.
“Shut up!” Emilia says, jostling me. “You're lying.”
I turn to her. “I wish I were.”
“How? When? Is it”—she shudders—“Thad's?”
“No.”
She blows out a relieved breath. “Oh, thank god. Dodged that bullet.”
The light bulb goes off for her. “Well, if it's not Thad, then who?”
I slide my eyes over to Harper.
“Lowell,” she says quietly.
I swallow harshly just hearing his name.
“It is, isn't it?” Harper pushes.
When I nod, Emilia gasps again.
“W-W-What?” she sputters. “How! Where! When!”
“My wedding,” Harper answers for her.
I nod again.
“That's where you disappeared to?” Emilia slaps at my shoulder. “You
lied to me! You said you went back to your room because you weren't
feeling well and thought you had come down with something.”
“More like came down on something—some dick.”
I burst into laughter at Harper's blunt words, and it's exactly what I
needed. I laugh and laugh until my laughter turns to tears once again.
I don't know how long it takes me to stop crying, but when I do, there's
a tissue in my hand courtesy of Emilia, and I dry my eyes.
“Sorry,” I say. “I'm kind of a hormonal wreck right now.”
“Don't apologize. This is kind of a life-changing situation right here.”
I laugh sardonically. “You can say that again.”
“What are you going to do?”
“Well, I'm sure I'll probably cry some more, but after that, I'm not
sure.”
Emilia laughs. “No, I mean, with the baby. Are you going to…”
“Yes,” I answer her unasked question. “I'm keeping it no matter what.”
She gives me a sympathetic smile because we all know my life is about
to change entirely. Hell, my life already has changed entirely. Since the
moment those tests in the drugstore bathroom came back positive, I've
known nothing will ever be the same again.
“What happened? I thought you two weren't getting along,” Emilia
says.
I think back to the wedding that now seems so long ago—probably
because I feel like I've lived three lifetimes over the last three days—and
frown. My problems that day seem so silly compared to this.
“We weren't. Then we were. And then we really were.” I shrug. “You
know how weddings go—they make you horny and you do stupid things.”
“Ha. You can say that again.” She doesn't elaborate, but I'm sure it has
to do with her mystery man who may or may not be a hockey player. “So,
are you two like dating now?”
I shake my head. “No. It was just a one-time thing.”
“He is kind of known for that.” She slaps her hand over her mouth.
“Sorry. Ignore that.”
She has nothing to be sorry for. Based on the way he slipped out of my
room so easily, I kind of figured it wasn't his first time leaving a naked
woman alone in a bed.
“It's fine,” I tell her, though I don't exactly feel fine. It worries me that
Lowell might not take the news of the pregnancy very well.
“I, uh, hate to be the one to ask, but have you told Lowell yet?” Harper
asks like she's reading my mind.
“Not yet.”
“Tell him what?”
We all jump at the sudden sound of Collin's voice.
He's standing in the kitchen, staring out at us with his hands on his hips,
watchful eyes darting between the three of us. He's breathing hard, one
earbud still in his ear, sweaty and gross like he just got done running ten
miles, and hell, he probably did.
None of us speak up, so he says, “What are you telling Lowell?”
“That he's got a nice ass!” Emilia blurts out in a panic.
It's pointless. Collin isn't stupid. He knows he just walked in on a
serious conversation.
“Did he do something?”
“What? No! Well, yes, kind of.”
His brows inch closer together. “I'll kill him.” He spins on his heel like
he's going to murder him right this instant, and I lurch from the couch.
“Stop!”
“No. If he hurt you or upset you, I'm killing him. Harper, where's our
shovel?”
“It's in the garage.”
“Harper!” I yell at her, rushing into the kitchen after him.
She shrugs. “Sorry, just reflex.”
“Collin, stop. You can't kill him.”
“And why the hell not?”
“Because I'm pregnant!”
He stops, eyes wide. “You're pregnant? What does that have to do with
Lo…” It takes a moment for him to work it out, but when it clicks, his
brows slam together once more. “You're pregnant and you're saying the
baby is Lowell's?”
I place my hand over my belly. “Yes.”
“The wedding?”
“Yes.”
“I see.” He nods a few times, then claps his hands together. “Well, now
I'm really killing him.”
“Collin!” Harper admonishes this time.
“What? You can't expect me to not murder him! He's an idiot and took
advantage of your sister when she was vulnerable and knocked her up. He
needs his head smashed in for that!”
He's wrong and right.
He's wrong because Lowell didn't take advantage of me. Hell, I was the
one who kissed him back. I was the one who told him I didn't need a friend.
I was the one who asked him to make a bad decision with me.
I try not to laugh at that because this was really not the bad decision I
was talking about. I just meant sex, a one-night stand that would make
being around each other a little awkward and uncomfortable because we'd
seen each other naked.
I didn't mean a get me pregnant kind of bad decision.
“You can't kill him yet. He doesn't even know. Let's at least see how he
reacts before we commit to several years in prison.” Harper tries to reason
with her husband, going over to kiss him on the cheek to calm him down.
It works.
“Fine,” Collin concedes. “But if that fucker so much as reacts any
differently than complete and utter fucking joy, he's dead.”
That doesn't sound fair at all, but I don't tell him that. I'm sure the last
thing he is expecting is to hear from me, and I bet he's really not expecting
what I'm going to have to tell him. If he reacts with anything other than
complete shock, I'll be surprised.
I just hope he doesn't completely turn me away. I've had enough lifechanging news this week.
“When are you telling him?” Collin asks.
“I, uh, was going to tell him tonight.”
“Okay. That's probably best. We're about to head into preseason soon,
and…” He trails off.
Right. Because Lowell is a professional hockey player.
I'm pregnant, and the father is an NHL superstar.
I did not have this on my bingo card at all.
I nod. “I know. I'll tell him.”
“Good.” He shakes his head, muttering something I can't quite
understand, but I'm pretty sure it's nothing good about Lowell and this
whole situation. He points down the hall. “I'm going to go take a shower,
let you girls finish your little hormone fest.” He presses a quick kiss to
Harper's head, then takes off down the hall.
“Uh, hey, Collin?”
He turns back around. “Yeah?”
“Do you think I could get Lowell's number?”
He blinks once. Twice. Then drops his head, shaking it.
“So fucking dead.”

LOWELL
I press the decrease button on the treadmill several times, taking my speed
from seven MPH to a nice brisk four MPH to cool off. I try not to burn
myself out in the gym in the off-season too much, especially since I help
out at summer skate camp.
Lately though, I have so much energy and pent-up frustration that if I
don't do something to expend it all, I'm going to combust. I don't have a
clue as to what's wrong with me, but I haven't been able to shake this
feeling of irritation all summer.
I'm annoyed because I'm bored at home, but I'm annoyed when I have
to leave the house. I'm annoyed when there's too much noise and annoyed
when it's completely silent. Nothing feels right, everything's just slightly…
off.
I'm slightly off.
I think the worst of it all is that I can almost pinpoint the exact minute I
started feeling this way—the morning after Collin and Harper's wedding.
It took every ounce of willpower I had to make myself crawl out of bed
and leave Hollis to sleep, but I did it because that was what we agreed upon.
I did it because I knew starting something up with my teammate's sister-inlaw would be really, really stupid. I did it because I was scared that I liked
her a little too much, and I can't afford that.
Except ever since I left her lying there, I haven't been able to stop
thinking about her.
I haven't been able to stop thinking about the way she felt under me. Or
the way she tensed and whimpered just before she came. The way she
moaned my name like it was a curse. And I definitely can't stop thinking
about the way she tasted on my lips.
Try as I might, I can't stop thinking about her at all.
My cock starts to swell, which is really inconvenient considering I'm
trying to wind down, not work myself back up.
I slow the treadmill down another notch, letting my legs cool off for a
quarter mile before hitting the shower and heading home to yet another
night cooped up inside my house with a Caesar salad and a Marvel movie
pulled up.
Normally when I get tired of being alone, I'll call up Collin or Rhodes
or even Smith. But the last two times I did, they all three shot me down, so I
haven't bothered with them since.
I could call Miller and see what he's up to, but I'm not that desperate…
yet. Besides, preseason is soon. I'm sure I can find something to keep me
occupied until then.
I click the machine off and grab the hand towel I have sitting in the
cupholder. I run it over my face, wiping away the sweat that's dripping off
me, and grab my phone.
I'm surprised to see I have a new message. I didn't hear it go off during
my run, but I was pretty in the zone, so that's no real surprise.
Unknown: Hi.
That's what the first message reads, and I pinch my brows together,
annoyed. I don't recognize the number, and there's not much I can discern
from a two-letter word.
Then, my phone buzzes against my hand.
Unknown: Wow. That was stupid. I realize you probably have
no idea who this is, huh?
And I still don't.
Unknown: It's Hollis.
Unknown: From the wedding.
Unknown: Harper and Collin's wedding.
Unknown: I'm Harper's sister, Hollis.
I smile as she overexplains and find myself just the tiniest bit bothered that
she really thinks I could possibly forget her.
I couldn't forget her if I tried, and trust me, I did.
Me: Sorry, you must have me confused with someone else. I
don't remember anyone named Hollis from Harper and
Collin's wedding.
Me: Wait—is that you, darlin'?
Hollis: In case you're wondering, I am hardcore glaring at you
right now.
Me: Noted.
Hollis: Collin gave me your number. I hope you don't mind.
Me: I don't.
And that's the truth. I don't mind.
In fact, I'm glad Collin gave her my number. I can't even count the
number of times I wanted to ask him for it and stopped myself from doing
it.
Me: But I am surprised to be hearing from you.
Hollis: Given how we left things, I'm sure.
I'm not certain if that's a dig for how I slipped out before she woke, but it
makes me feel guilty either way.
Hollis: Would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
As surprised as I was to see her text pop up on my phone, this surprises me
even more.
Do I want to have dinner with her? Yes. But I should tell her no, should
tell her I'm busy or seeing someone, should remind her that the night we
shared was a one-time thing.
I shouldn't be playing this dangerous game with her.
But…I want to. I really, really want to.
My fingers fly over the screen, and I hit send before I can take it all
back.
Me: Yes.
I step out of my truck and toss my keys to the valet.
He looks at me like I'm insane.
“Uh, sir?”
“Put it under Lowell.”
His eyes widen, recognizing the name.
“Yes, sir,” he mutters, dipping his head and rushing to the driver's side
of my beat-up truck that I truly have no business valet parking.
I slide a hand down my button-up shirt—something I hardly ever wear
—and suck in a breath. Not that I'd ever admit it out loud, but I'm almost
nervous to see Hollis.
I shouldn't be. This isn't a date or anything. It's just dinner between two
friends who have definitely seen each other naked.
But we're not friends.
Or lovers.
I have no idea what we are.
This is why this is an absolutely horrible idea. I should leave, should
text her and tell her something came up.
But I can't stop myself from pulling open the door to the restaurant
anyway.
It takes me all of two seconds to spot her sitting at the end of the bar.
She's staring at the drink in front of her, her fingers playing with the straw,
pushing the ice cubes back and forth.
God, even from the side she's more beautiful than I remember, and I
remember a lot about her. Her brown hair is longer than it was a few
months ago, and it's tied up in a messy, low-hanging bun that looks almost
like she just threw it up and also totally intentional at the same time. She's
wearing a flower-print dress paired with a cardigan over her shoulders,
leaving a whole lot to the imagination.
As if she can sense my presence, she turns toward the door, and our
gazes clash for the first time in months. She looks the same yet different,
and I can't quite place my finger on why.
The corners of her lips tip up just slightly like she's both happy and sad
to see me. I'm not quite sure how I feel about that as I make my way
through the restaurant, trying to ignore the stares of the other patrons.
I don't really go out a lot, and this is a big reason why. People are
always staring, talking about me behind their hands, trying to figure out
where exactly they know me from, and the hockey fans who do know me
don't always respect boundaries.
But I'm not paying attention to them right now.
The only thing I can focus on is Hollis.
We don't break eye contact. Not when I slip onto the stool next to her,
and not even when the bartender stops in front of us.
“What can I get you?” they ask.
“I'll have whatever she's having.”
“You got it.”
I stare at her, taking her in because I can't seem to take my eyes off her.
It's not that I thought I'd never see her again. She's Harper's sister; I
knew we'd be running into one another at some point. I just didn't think I'd
see her again not on neutral ice.
Without thinking too much about it, I lean forward and press a quick
kiss to her cheek. I don't miss her sharp inhale at the innocent gesture.
But it's not innocent. We both know that.
When I lean back, I still can't stop staring at her.
She shifts under my gaze, the smile on her lips growing shy as her
cheeks turn pink. “What?” she asks, almost like she's nervous.
“Nothing. Just…it's good to see you.”
She blows out a breath, taking the straw of her drink back between her
fingers. “You say that now.”
I tip my head in question, not understanding what she's meaning, but I
don't have the option to ask because the bartender slides my drink to me,
pulling us both from the moment.
“Thanks,” I say to them.
“No problem. Would you like to place an order for your dinner, or did
you need a moment?”
“I'm…not hungry,” she says, her lips curling upward.
“Are you sure?”
She nods. “Positive. I've been…sick recently. I'm still not feeling the
best.”
“Not even some French fries?”
Her eyes light up when I say it. “Actually, those do sound good.”
“Two orders of fries, please,” I tell the bartender. “One with bacon and
cheese.”
Hollis lurches forward next to me, a hand covering her mouth like she's
about to vomit at the mere mention of it.
I catch her by the hip to stop her from falling off the stool. “Are you
okay?”
She nods, still not moving her hand from her mouth. “The ba—”
Another lurch. “No bacon. Please.”
“Okay, yeah. No bacon.” I nod at the bartender, who seems to
understand what's going on, then look back at Hollis. “Are you sure you're
okay? If you're not up to this, we can get together some other time.”
She shakes her head, moving her hand from her mouth and sucking in a
few deep breaths. “No, I'm okay. We need to do this tonight.”
“Do what tonight? It's just dinner.”
She winces. “It's not just dinner though.”
“O…kay.” I draw the word out, completely confused by what's going
on right now.
I wait for her to fill me in, but she doesn't. She turns her attention back
to the drink in front of her, plunging the straw into the ice cubes that
haven't melted yet.
I take a sip of my own drink and pull a face. “Ugh. What the hell is
this?”
“Sparkling water.”
“That is definitely not what I was expecting,” I say, setting the cup
down, reminding myself to ask the bartender for a real drink. “Tastes like
ass.”
She grins at that, then just as quickly as the smile appeared, it's gone.
She's acting strange and fidgeting way too much for my liking.
Something is definitely up.
“What's going on, Hollis?”
She opens her mouth to speak, then snaps it back closed, shaking her
head.
I'm starting to grow frustrated with her non-answers. I'm about to ask
her just what the fuck is going on when the bartender sets the two baskets of
fries between us.
Much to Hollis' horror—and mine—they forgot to leave off the bacon.
The moment the basket is on the counter, she slaps her hand over her
mouth and charges toward the restrooms, knocking into not one but two
waiters on her way through.
It takes me several seconds to catch up to what's happening before I
take off after her to make sure she's okay. I burst into the women's
restroom, not caring who else might be in there, and find her hunched over
a toilet emptying her stomach.
Whatever sickness she had, she definitely still has it.
I curl my hand around hers, taking over holding her hair back for her as
she continues to get it all out. When the last of her dry heaves subside, I let
her go and help her to her feet. She turns into my arms, burying her face in
my chest.
I just hold her.
Even when she begins to cry, I still hold her. Whatever is going on, it's
breaking her…and it's breaking me to see her like this.
When her sobs die down, she pushes away from me, then wipes at her
midnight eyes. Just from the look in them, I have a feeling whatever is
about to come out of her mouth is going to wreck me.
“I'm pregnant.”
My heart drops straight to the floor.
When she asked me to dinner, I didn't think she was asking me so she
could tell me she's pregnant.
The scariest part of it all is that I know she's telling me because it
involves me.
Even still, I can't help the words that leave my mouth next.
“Are you sure?”
“I'm sure. The doctor confirmed it this morning. I—”
“No,” I cut her off, shaking my head. “Are you sure?”
Her eyes narrow. “You better not be asking me what I think you're
asking me, Lowell.”
I don't answer.
Her nostrils flare, and she shoves at my chest so hard I stumble
backward out of the stall. She follows, her eyes nearly black, shaking her
head as she heads to the sink.
“Am I sure? Are you serious?”
Again, I say nothing.
“Get out!” she screams, shoving at me again. “Go!”
But I don't get out. I don't go.
I can't.
I'm stuck here in this spot trying to figure out how the hell this
happened.
Done with me, she throws her hands up and moves to the sink. She
loads her hands up with soap and scrubs and scrubs and scrubs, all while
muttering about what an ass I am.
I am an ass. I'm an ass who somehow got my one-night stand pregnant,
then questioned if the baby is mine knowing full well it is.
I swallow the lump forming in my throat.
She shuts the water off, then grabs a paper towel, drying her hands.
She turns, glaring at me. “Do you have anything to say?”
“I…I don't know what you want me to say. I don't understand how this
happened. I used a condom. I always use a condom.”
She huffs out a laugh. “Yeah, well, clearly condoms aren't always
foolproof.”
They aren't, and they especially aren't if they've been tampered with.
I don't voice the concern, mostly because I feel sick for even thinking it.
Hollis would never do that.
She tosses the paper towel in the trash, then folds her arms over her
chest, watching me and waiting. I don't know what she's waiting for
because I don't know what to say right now.
This isn't…this isn't how this was supposed to go.
Just one night. That's it.
Not this. Never this.
“What, Lowell? Nothing to say?”
“I don't know what you want me to say.”
“I want you to say something other than Are you sure because that's
about as much as you've said about the whole thing.”
“I'm just…in shock right now. I haven't seen you in months and then
you just show up and announce to me that you're pregnant and I'm just…
trying to process it is all.”
“Haven't seen me in months? You're the one who left me in bed!”
“You knew the rules,” I say, and it's exactly the wrong thing to say.
She snaps her head back like I've slapped her with my words.
“Knew the rules?” She scoffs. “Yeah, I guess I did know them. But
guess what, Lowell? The rules have changed. The game has changed. I'm
pregnant whether you like it or not, and I'm having this baby whether you
like it or not. If you don't want to be involved, just say so, but don't stand
there and act like this is all my fault and I did it on purpose to trap you or
something.”
I swallow the bile that swims up my throat. She doesn't know how close
she is to exactly what happened to me with Celine. Get pregnant, get
married, get my money—that was the plan.
I don't know who Hollis was with before me. I don't know if she was
with someone after me. And while I don't think Hollis would do what
Celine did, there are too many variables to form an opinion right now,
especially when in reality, I don't actually know her all that well.
“Oh my god.” Her mouth drops open. “That's what you think, isn't it?
You think I planned this, don't you? Think it was a scheme I cooked up or
something.” She takes a step toward me, her nose nearly touching mine.
“Well, guess what, buddy? I didn't want this, and I especially didn't want it
with you.”
She shoves past me and out of the restroom, leaving me standing there
wondering just what in the fuck I'm going to do.

HOLLIS
“He said what?”
“And I quote, Are you sure?”
“That asshole!” Emilia bursts out, slamming her hand on the table.
“I cannot believe he'd say that.” Ryan's sitting with her mouth hanging
open, staring at me like I've got two heads. It's about how I felt last night
when I heard it.
Harper's the only one who hasn't said a word, but I can see the way her
jaw is clenched. She's equally as upset as them, and I have no doubt she's
already determining how she's going to get away with his murder.
I love their outrage for me, but it pretty much went down exactly like I
was expecting it to. I mean, sure, I didn't think Lowell would question
whether the baby is actually his or would pretty much insinuate that I got
pregnant on purpose to trap him, but I figured he wouldn't exactly be
thrilled to be having a child with his one-night stand either.
God, the look on his face when I told him…there was such a mixture of
emotions in such a short time. He looked terrified, which was no surprise.
Then he looked like he might puke—again, no surprise there.
Then came the betrayal and disgust.
Those two hurt the most.
A waiter sets down a replacement basket of chips for us and drops off
three margaritas. The four of us are currently sitting at a table outside a
Mexican restaurant for lunch because I am a firm believer that there is
nothing queso and tequila can't fix. Since I can't partake in the tequila
myself, I'm leaving it to them to get drunk for me in solidarity with this
hilariously bad time I'm having right now.
How did my life get so messed up in the last year?
“I hate him,” Emilia says, taking a sip of her margarita, shaking her
head. “He's always seemed like such a nice guy. I can't believe he'd say
that.”
“It's fine.” I wave my hand. “It was just…shocking.”
“It's not fine, Hollis,” she insists. “It's far from fine. He's the one who
did this to you, and he needs to step up and take responsibility for it.”
“In case you forgot, I was an active participant in the whole ordeal.”
“Oh, I didn't forget. I didn't forget because I am dying to know how the
sex was, but I've been too scared to ask you because I didn't want you to
burst into tears again.”
I steal a chip from the basket and throw it at her.
“Hey!” She tosses one back my way, missing me completely and hitting
the person at the table behind us.
They don't notice, and we all snicker at their obliviousness.
“I'm kind of curious too,” Ryan says, grabbing her own chip. “Lowell
has always given off this intense sort of vibe. I wonder if that carries into
the bedroom too.”
“I'm totally telling Rhodes you think about other dudes in the
bedroom.”
Ryan glares at Harper. “You wouldn't dare. He'll—actually, you know
what? Go ahead and tell him. I'll take the punishment.” She pops the chip
in her mouth, almost giddy at that thought.
“So, how was it?” Emilia asks again.
“How was what?” I feign ignorance, taking a sip of my water.
“The sex!” She shouts it just a little too loud, drawing stares from others
at the tables next to ours. “You know, the sex you had with the hot-as-hell
pro-hockey player. They've got stamina for days, you know.”
“Sounds like you're speaking from experience,” I toss back, and she
flicks her eyes away, avoiding my gaze. Dammit. One of these days, I will
get her to talk about it.
“I'm definitely speaking from experience when I say you heard right,”
Ryan says.
“Can confirm,” Harper agrees.
“See? I was right. Tell us.”
“It was…” I lift a shoulder. “It was nice.”
“Nice? Nice? You got pregnant from nice sex? How boring.” Emilia
pouts. “Never tell your child that.”
I laugh. “I don't think I'll be telling the tale of how my baby was
conceived.”
“You never know. My mother told me once—in detail. Like way, way
too much detail.” She shudders, then reaches for her drink again. “She was
drunk, which is what I'm about to be.” She takes a healthy sip, then dips
another chip in the queso. “Tell me or I'm going to throw this messy-as-hell
chip at you.”
“You wouldn't.”
“Oh, I would.”
She lifts it to chuck it my way, and I hold my hand up.
“Fine, fine. I'll tell you. Put the weapon down.” I shake my head at her
antics as she pops the chip into her mouth with a victorious grin. I glance
around the table, and all of them are staring at me expectantly, apparently
very invested in knowing how sex with Lowell was.
I don't know what to tell them because I don't know how to put it into
words.
I don't know how to tell them I've thought about it almost nonstop since
it happened. I don't know how to tell them it was the single most amazing
experience of my life. How he laid me out across the bed and took his time
stripping my dress from my body, then kissing every single inch of it,
bringing me to orgasm twice before sliding into me and going for the hat
trick. How he was gentle in the best ways and rough in all the even better
ones.
And how the worst part is not even him being a giant asshole last night
can taint it.
I don't know how to say any of that, so I just say, “Better than anything
I've ever had before.”
Not that I have much to compare it to. I've only had sex with three men
in my life. One was my high school boyfriend, and that was over in about
point two seconds. The other was Thad, and he was pretty much a one-trick
pony…if you count just slamming into me in missionary to be a trick.
“You're totally glowing just thinking about it.” Emilia grins, bouncing
her brows up and down.
“I think that's just part of being pregnant.”
“Or the sign of some really hot sex.” She frowns like she's just
remembered who that really hot sex was with. “I have half a mind to go to
my uncle and tell him what a giant jerk Lowell is being. Have him mess
with his equipment or something.”
“While I very much appreciate it, that's not necessary.”
“I could have Rhodes accidentally cup-check him during practice,”
Ryan offers.
I grin. “Again, thank you, but no.”
“You have to know Collin is going to murder him when he hears about
this, don't you?” Harper says.
“No, because you're not telling him.”
“Hollis! You can't be serious!”
“I am. I'm very serious. This whole…thing…it's between me and
Lowell and that's it. I don't need you ladies to deploy your men to fight my
battles for me.” I look pointedly at Emilia because I don't know exactly
who her man is, but I don't want her getting any ideas either. “It's going to
be fine. I'll figure it out.”
Harper shakes her head, clearly upset with me. I'm upset with me too,
especially for getting myself into this mess where the father of my baby
thinks I'm just some puck bunny trying to trap him.
I have no idea what gave him the idea that that's the type of person I
am, but it really bothers me that he thinks I'm even remotely capable of
doing something like that. It's what kept me up half the night trying to
figure it out.
Well, that and the urge to pee every damn hour.
“Have you told Mom yet?” Harper asks.
I groan. “Ugh. No, not yet. Mostly because I'm terrified she's going to
start apartment hunting out here the moment she finds out.”
“I'd be surprised if she already hasn't started now that we both live
here.”
I love my mother something fierce. She's a good person with a really
good heart, and Harper and I are her entire world.
But she can also be very…suffocating. She wasn't always like that.
Sure, she was a concerned mother and always wanted us girls to be careful,
but it got worse after our father passed. Suddenly everywhere we went and
everything we did was too dangerous. I bet if she could have gotten away
with it, she would have wrapped us up in bubble wrap just to keep us from
ever getting hurt again.
Keeping Harper and me safe and being overprotective is her way of
coping with not just my father dying, but how he died—in a car accident on
his way to see his mistress.
Up until that point, they'd had the perfect marriage. Sixteen years of
bliss. Sixteen years of dancing in the kitchen to Frank Sinatra and lavish
anniversary dinners. Sixteen years of good-morning kisses and never going
to bed angry.
To say her heart broke in the worst kind of way when she discovered
why he was out in the middle of a snowstorm would be an understatement.
She wants to protect us from that same hurt.
I lay my hand over my still flat belly because, in a crazy sort of way, I
kind of get it now. I haven't even met my baby yet and I already have this
intense urge to protect it at all costs. I can't imagine how strong that feeling
is going to be when they're nearly thirty.
“Let's talk about something else,” Emilia says. “Like baby names or
something. I personally think Emilia is beautiful, but I could be incredibly
biased on that.”
“You are,” Harper tells her. “But I think we can all agree that Harper is a
beautiful name too.”
I look at Ryan. “Care to throw your own name in the ring too?”
“Nah. I'll keep my name to myself, thanks. Though I do think you
should name your baby something badass, like Buffy or Khaleesi.”
I wait for her to laugh, but she doesn't.
“Oh, what about Katniss? Or Xena? You know, like the Warrior
Princess. I got it!” Emilia snaps. “Alanis! Like Morissette. She's like the
crusher of men's hopes and dreams and it's amazing. Total angry-girl rock
goddess.”
“That is… I'll take that into consideration too.”
“What if it's a boy?” Ryan points out.
“Thor. Definitely Thor,” Emilia says. “No, wait! What about Thanos?
Wait—no. Thor is much better.”
Ryan and Emilia settle into a debate over names, but Harper doesn't join
in. Instead, she slips her hand into mine and squeezes it.
“Even if Lowell doesn't come around, it's obvious that baby Buffy
Khaleesi Katniss Xena Alanis is going to be so loved.”
“Or Thor Thanos.”
She grins. “Or Thor Thanos.”
And for the first time since I took those tests, I don't feel so alone.
I was right about my mother.
I hold my phone propped on my pillow and try not to sigh as she starts
listing off all the apartments she's been looking at nearby.
“And then there's one that's only about two miles up the road from you.
They have a gorgeous garden I can picture enjoying my morning coffee in,”
she says, flipping the phone—like literally the entire phone, not just the
camera—to show me a distorted photo of said garden.
“Looks great, Mom, but don't you think you're jumping the gun here?”
She flips the phone back around and gives me a sharp glare. “Don't take
that tone with me, Hollis Pearl.”
I try not to cringe at the use of my middle name, which I loathe entirely.
I make a promise to myself right then to not give my child an awful middle
name.
“I'm going to be a grandmother. A grandmother, Hollis! Of course I'm
going to want to be part of that child's life, and I can't really do that from
the other side of the state, now can I?”
I want to point out that yes, she can, and I will make trips back and forth
all the time, but I know no matter what I say, it won't be enough. I may as
well resign myself to the fact that my mother will be moving out this way
with or without my approval. It's only a matter of time now.
“I know, Mom, I just—” My words are cut off by a big yawn, and a
frown tugs at her lips the moment my mouth opens.
“What's wrong? Everything okay?”
I barely resist the urge to roll my eyes. “Everything's fine. I'm just tired,
you know. Growing life and all that. I'm sure you remember what that's
like.”
“Oh, gosh, do I ever. You girls wore me out so badly before you were
even born. Especially Harper because she was just so unpredictable.” A
sweet smile tugs at her lips. “Forever marching to the beat of her own drum,
that one.”
She's right. Harper's always been just who she is and has never
apologized for it a day in her life. I've always admired that about her and
wish I could say I've done the same, but I haven't. Where Harper has
always been the type to stand out in a crowd and try new things, I've been
the type to blend in and not take many risks. It was easier that way. Safer.
Of course the one time I step out of my comfort zone and do something
risky, I get punished for it.
I pat my stomach. Sorry, little bit, you're not a punishment.
“Anyway, I should let you get some rest,” my mother says, surprising
me. “I'm sure this week has been very exciting for you.”
Exciting isn't the exact word I'd use for it.
When I told her I'm pregnant, the first thing she asked was if the baby is
Thad's and if we'd be getting back together. At first, I was really hurt that
she thought I'd go back to him after what he did to me. But when she blew
out a relieved breath when I told her not a chance, I was glad.
She asked if I was dating someone, and I said no.
After that, she dropped it. I was surprised she didn't press the issue and
ask more questions since she's typically all up in my business about
everything else. I think she could sense my turmoil regarding the situation.
She's not asking now, but I know she will later, and I'm already dreading
the conversation.
“Something like that,” I murmur.
Concern pulls at her eyes and I can tell she has so much to say, but she
doesn't say it. Instead, she says, “I love you, Hollis. Everything will be
okay.”
And because I'm a complete hot mess, tears sting my eyes. This week
has been exhausting, and I don't think I realized how badly I needed to hear
that from my own mother.
“Thanks, Mom. I love you too.”
“I know.” She winks. “Get some rest, okay? Call me tomorrow.”
“I will. Good night.”
“Good night, kiddo.”
I toss my phone onto the pillow beside me and roll over onto my back. I
stare up at the ceiling, running my hands over my stomach, marveling at the
fact that I have a little cherry-sized human growing inside of me.
Harper was right. Even if Lowell doesn't come around, I know this baby
will be loved and cared for. I have support from some of the greatest people
in the world who will make sure that holds true.
“Everything will be okay,” I tell myself as my eyes drift shut.
This time when I say it, I almost believe it.

LOWELL
“Hold your horses! I'm coming!”
I push my arm through my shirt as I amble through the house to find out
who the fuck is knocking on my door at this hour. It's barely seven AM, and
I have no clue who it could be. Only three people on the team even know
where I live—and one of those people is Coach.
Blurry-eyed, I bump into a table in the hallway.
“Fuck,” I mutter, annoyed at the table and myself. I've slept like
absolute dog shit last two nights, and I'd really rather not deal with whoever
is standing on my porch right now.
I yank the door open, a scowl firmly in place. “Wh—” I don't even get
the full word out before a fist connects with my face and I stumble
backward into the house. “What the…” I clutch my face as Collin shoves
his way inside my home.
He slams the door behind him, then slams me into the wall so hard I'm
going to be surprised if there's not a dent in it. He drags his forearm over
my throat, holding me in place as he gives me a murderous glare.
“What the hell, man?” I spit out, and he doesn't even flinch when my
blood splatters against his face. “What the fuck are you doing in my house,
Wright?”
“What the hell is wrong with you?” he hisses, shoving into my windpipe
with just enough pressure to knock the breath out of me. “Huh? What in the
actual fuck is wrong with you, Lowell?”
He shoves his arm into my throat again, this time hard enough that I
choke. I make a halfhearted attempt to try to fight him off, but the prick is
big and not going anywhere. Besides, I know deep in my gut that I deserve
this and so much more.
I was a total dick to Hollis the other night. The second the shock of
everything wore off, I knew I was completely in the wrong.
She wouldn't be setting me up. I know she wouldn't. We didn't spend a
lot of time together, but I know she's not that kind of person.
After she told me, I was up half the night staring at my phone trying to
decide whether I should call or text and what the fuck I was going to say to
make everything better. I kept coming up blank because I have no idea how
I am going to make it better.
Shit. It's been thirty-six hours and I still don't know how I'm going to
make it better.
“I…I'm sorry, okay? I fucked up. Are you happy?”
His eyes narrow on me, making sure I'm telling the truth. Satisfied with
what he sees, he shoves on me once more before releasing me, letting me
drop back down to my feet.
I gulp in deep breaths of air and wipe at the blood leaking from my nose
and mouth.
“Shit, man,” I say, still trying to catch my breath. “You're lucky I've
already lost my real teeth or else I'd be really pissed.”
“Yeah, well, join the club because I am pissed.” He shakes his head at
me. “What the fuck, dude?”
I take a few more deep breaths before pushing off the wall and righting
myself. I shove past him, making sure to knock him in the shoulder, and
head for the kitchen to clean off all the blood and get an ice pack.
He follows behind me, no doubt glaring holes into the back of my head.
“Did you really ask her if she's sure it's yours?”
I grimace at his words as I pull a bottle of water from the fridge and
twist off the cap. I swish the water around my mouth a few times to get the
taste of blood out. Then I down the rest of it in one drink and close the
fridge, not bothering to offer Collin anything because screw him after what
he just did.
I mean, I deserved it, but screw him.
“I…sort of implied,” I finally say after several long moments.
“And did you also imply that she got pregnant on purpose to try to trap
you?”
Another grimace, which is answer enough.
I grab the dish towel that's hanging off the stove, run it under some cold
water, and press it to my split lip that's no doubt doubled in size already.
Fuck, Collin hits hard.
“I have to ask again…what the hell is wrong with you, Lowell? Why the
hell would you say that to her? Do you really think that is something Hollis
is capable of?”
“No! Not at all.”
“Then why did you say it?”
I narrow my eyes at him. “You know why.”
“Because of that shit with Celine all those years ago?”
“Yes!”
“Dude!” He runs his hands through his hair like he's irritated with me.
Well, I'm fucking irritated with him, barging into my house and hitting me
at the crack of dawn. “Get the fuck over it already.”
“It's not exactly that easy.”
“Yes, it is. Because they are two completely different people.”
“You think I don't know that?”
He holds his arms wide. “Apparently not, because here we are.”
“I freaked, okay? In my defense, I had just found out my one-night
stand got pregnant. Kind of a lot to take in, no?”
He grinds his teeth together. “I owe you another for that too—for taking
advantage of her when she was vulnerable.”
“It wasn't like that,” I argue, because it wasn't.
At least I don't think it was.
Fuck…was it? Did… Did Hollis not want it too? I knew she was
struggling with the wedding and how fresh her divorce was, but it's not like
I pressured her into anything. Hell, she was the one who asked me to make
a bad decision with her. Did I do something wrong by saying yes?
“How did that even happen? Did you not wrap your shit up?”
“Of course I did! I just… The condom was kind of old, all right? It was
one I'd had in my wallet for a while.”
“A while? How long is a while?”
I screw my face up, not wanting to admit it. “A…year. Or more.”
He tosses his head back with a groan. “Holy fuck. No wonder you got
her knocked up.”
“Hey, it's not like I went to your wedding in hopes of falling into some
pussy, okay? That wasn't part of my plan at all. I know how desperate
unattached women at weddings are to attach themselves to someone. I was
not about to get mixed up in that.”
“But you did. You did get mixed up in it, and look where that got you.”
Fuck. He has me there.
I rest my elbows on the counter and drop my head into my hands. I can't
believe I got myself into this situation. Again, technically.
Only this time, it's real. It's very real and very fucking scary.
“How are you feeling?”
“Like shit. My face hurts, and I now have a pounding headache and I
think my tooth is loose. And I'm—”
“No, not that. About the baby, you idiot.”
Right. That.
That is a whole different barrage of emotions I'm not sure I want to get
into this early.
I'm scared.
I'm angry.
I'm worried.
I'm confused.
I'm so many different things, and I'm having a really hard time
processing it all.
“I—”
Another loud knock sounds on the door, interrupting me.
Who the hell is it this time?
I look to Collin, and he shrugs. “Beats me.”
I push off the counter and head for the front door. I peel it open, and, for
the second time this morning, a fist connects with my face.
“Ow! Son of a bitch!” I cradle my nose, which is now bleeding along
with my lip as I stumble back from the impact.
“You stupid fuck!” Rhodes rages, tossing me against the wall just like
Collin did. “Are you insane? Do you have a death wish? Do you—”
Movement from down the hall catches his attention. Collin's leaning
against the wall, arms crossed, clearly enjoying the show.
“Don't mind me,” he says. “Please continue.”
I shove at Rhodes, trying to get the beast of a man off me. He glares up
at me, shoving me into the wall once more before letting me go.
I can't decide if I want to keep my nose covered or rub at the bruise that
is no doubt forming on my chest at this point.
“Fuck,” I mutter, looking between them. “Is anyone else going to punch
their way into my house today?”
The door, which was never closed, is pushed open, and in steps Miller.
“I won't hit you, Lowell.” He holds his hands up. “I can't afford to mess
up these silky mitts.”
“Why the hell are you all here so early?”
“Uh, because apparently you're a dumbass who needed an ass beating,
and that's saying something coming from me,” Miller explains. He shuts the
front door, then claps his hands. “So, what's for breakfast, boys? I'm
starving.”
With a sigh, I shake my head and leave them in the hallway while I head
to my bedroom for a clean shirt since this one now has bloodstains on it
after I got punched in the face twice.
How is it not even eight AM and I've already been bloodied and
bruised?
After I grab a shirt, I head back to the kitchen. Collin and Rhodes are
leaning against the island glaring at me. Miller is helping himself to a pot of
coffee but can't seem to figure out how the filter works.
I shove him out of the way and finish the job, setting the sizing for a full
pot and pressing start before turning around to meet the glares of my
teammates.
“Harper?” I point at Collin.
He nods.
“Ryan?” I say to Rhodes.
Another nod.
I look at Miller. “Then why the fuck are you here?”
He shrugs. “I was just coming over because I was bored and the
summer skate camp isn't for another few hours. I honestly have no idea
what's going on.”
“It's like seven in the morning!”
“Are you really going to be mad at a guy for missing his captain?” He
juts out his lip, pouting in a way that makes me want to be the third guy to
throw a punch today.
Instead, I just roll my eyes at him and turn to grab the now-finished
coffee. I grab two mugs—because fuck Collin and Rhodes—from the
cabinet above the pot, pour a cup for me and a cup for Miller, and slide one
his way.
“Thanks,” he says, taking a loud sip. “So, what'd I miss?”
His innocence makes us all chuckle.
“Dipshit over here”—Rhodes hitches his thumb my way—“slept with
Harper's sister at the wedding.”
“You dirty dog, you.” Miller smirks at me, shaking his head. “Thought
she was too crazy for you?”
I don't answer him. The only person who is crazy at this point is me for
thinking what we did was a good idea.
“That's not all,” Collin adds. “She's pregnant.”
Miller gasps. “No way! Did you not wrap it?”
I toss my head back on a groan. “Why does everyone keep asking me
that? Of course I did!”
“Not well enough, apparently. You gotta double up and shit.”
Rhodes shoots Miller a concerned look. “You do not double up. Ever.
Do you do that?”
“Uh…n-no,” Miller says, not sounding the least bit convincing.
I'm not even touching that right now. I don't have the energy. I have my
own problems to be dealing with.
“What are you going to do?” Miller asks the million-dollar question
they are all wanting an answer for.
Fuck. What am I going to do? I wasn't looking for this and certainly
wasn't prepared. Hell, I went to dinner with Hollis half-expecting to get my
dick wet at the end of the evening. I didn't expect this major, life-changing
bomb to be dropped on me.
So, what am I going to do?
Long term? I don't have a clue. That's not entirely up to me.
But I know what I need to do short term, and that's apologize to
Hollis…if she'll let me.
I look at Collin and Rhodes, who are both staring at me, waiting to hear
what I have to say. I swallow the lump that's been hanging out in my throat
since yesterday, then blow out a heavy breath.
“I guess I have a phone call to make.”

HOLLIS
After we left things at the restaurant the other night, the last thing I
expected this morning was to receive a call from Lowell asking if he could
come over.
I told him no at first because I wasn't sure if I wanted to deal with the
stress of seeing him before my appointment this afternoon, but he insisted
on it and eventually I caved. Which is why I'm currently standing in front
of my mirror in my third outfit of the morning trying to talk myself out of
changing again.
Part of my brain is screaming that I should wear that leather mini skirt I
bought two months ago because pretty soon I'm going to be too big to even
get it up past my hips, but I know that's completely impractical.
If it wasn't for nausea and headaches and hormonal changes, you
wouldn't know I was pregnant. Everything looks the same, though I know
that's not going to be the case in the coming months.
I don't know how I feel about that yet, seeing my body change like it's
going to. I know some women love being pregnant and love the way their
bodies look while others loathe it. I wonder where I'll fall on the spectrum.
I tuck two rolled-up pairs of socks into my bra, then grab a pillow off
my bed and stuff it under my shirt. I check myself out in the mirror, trying
to imagine what I'll look like waddling around with a little human inside of
me.
It'll be…different, that's for sure. I'm going to look like a whole
different person. Hell, I'm going to be a whole different person. That's hard
to reconcile sometimes.
A knock sounds at the door, pulling me from my thoughts.
Shit! Lowell.
My heart rate picks up and my palms start to feel sticky. It's stupid. I
shouldn't feel this way about the man whose baby I'm carrying, but I do.
I'm nervous because he makes me nervous.
I'm nervous because I have no idea how this conversation is going to
go.
I'm just…nervous.
I pull the pillow from my stomach and toss it to the bed before darting
for the front door. I take a deep, calming breath, brushing a hand through
my hair. When I feel like I'm not going to pass out, I pull it open.
Collecting my breath was a smart move because the moment my eyes
land on Lowell, he steals it back. He's just so…magnetic. I don't want to be
drawn to him. I don't want him to be north and me to be south.
He's wearing a simple light gray shirt and a pair of jeans that hug his
thighs just a little too well. There's a baseball cap slung backward on his
head, and he's sporting what looks like a fresh cut on his lip that I want to
ask him about.
When I reach those green eyes that make me feel all kinds of things I
don't understand, I find that he's looking at me with a searching gaze, like
he's looking for any indication I'm going to slam the door in his face.
I won't…yet.
Instead, I move aside, allowing him to pass. The moment he steps over
the threshold, I breathe again.
I close the door behind him, leaning against it because all of a sudden
I'm feeling lightheaded. I don't know if it's from being close to him or just
being plain exhausted, something I am more than not lately.
He looks around the small apartment, and I realize then this place must
be laughable compared to wherever he lives. He's a freaking hockey player.
He probably has a mansion…or two.
When he's done with his perusing, he shoves his hands into the pockets
of his jeans and looks at me. His eyes do a slow scroll of my body, starting
at my feet, going all the way up. He inspects me closely, not missing a
single inch, like he's looking for any sign that I truly am pregnant. I want to
tell him I'm not showing yet, but before I can get the words out, he grins.
“Well, those grew a lot faster than I expected.”
My brows pinch together, and I look down.
Oh god.
My cheeks are on fire as I reach into my bra, pluck the rolled-up socks
out, and toss them onto the couch.
“I was…practicing.”
“Having tits?”
I glare at him, pushing off the door and heading into the kitchen.
“Would you like something to drink?”
“Uh, yeah. Vodka if you got it.” I send him a look, and he laughs. “I was
kidding. Though a drink does sound good right now. I'm, uh, kind of
nervous.”
“You? Mr. NHL Superstar, nervous?”
He grins at the nickname as he takes a seat at the little breakfast nook.
“Hockey players do get nervous, you know.”
“Huh. Would have figured you'd be used to the pressure by now.”
“This kind of pressure is a bit different.”
“That's fair.” I pull open the fridge and reach for the container of orange
juice. “I don't have vodka, but I have mixer.”
“Mixer works too.”
I grab two glasses from the cabinet and pour each of us a cup. It's funny
because I've never been a huge orange juice person, but for some reason,
it's almost all I want to drink these days.
I slide a glass Lowell's way, then return the juice to the fridge before
grabbing my own glass and leaning back against the counter.
“Should you be standing?”
My eyes fall to slits. “Fair warning, there are many sharp objects in this
kitchen I can stab you with.”
“I will take that into consideration.” He smirks at me over the rim of his
orange juice before taking a sip, wincing at the sting of the acidity on the
cut in his lip.
“What happened to your face?” I ask.
“Collin.”
I lift my brows, surprised.
“And Rhodes,” he adds.
“Because of…?”
He shifts uncomfortably on the stool, not meeting my eyes when he
says, “You.”
Ah. So that's why he called me up—because Collin and Rhodes made
him, not because he actually cares.
“They aren't why I called, though,” he says like he knew exactly what I
was thinking. “I was going to call before they…well…” He motions to his
face, then clears his throat. “I just didn't really know what to say.”
“And now you do?”
“No.” He laughs humorlessly. “Not a damn clue, but I couldn't just sit
by and let you think bad thoughts about me either.”
“I wasn't thinking bad thoughts about you.”
It's not a total lie.
Did I think he was a dick for questioning the legitimacy of my
accidental pregnancy? Most definitely. But…I also understood. Given the
way we met, I'm not entirely sure I can blame him for lashing out during an
emotional moment.
He lifts his cap off his head, then scrubs a hand through his deep brown
hair before replacing it. He sighs. “I, uh, was engaged before.”
My brows shoot up because this is very much news to me, especially
given how much he protested weddings.
“It was several years ago. I was seeing this girl for about eight months,
and it was pretty serious, you know.” He shrugs. “I loved her.”
He chugs the rest of his orange juice, then gets up and heads for the
sink. He rinses the glass out, sticks it in the dishwasher. I watch him move
around my kitchen as if he lives here too, and I'm not sure how I feel about
the fact that I don't exactly hate it.
When he's finished, he turns to me, resting his back against the counter
opposite me. He crosses his arms over his chest, and I do my best to ignore
the way his shirt stretches over his muscles as he stares a hole into the floor.
“I proposed when she got pregnant.”
My eyes snap to him, surprised.
Is he…already a father?
“We made the engagement announcement, planned the wedding…the
whole thing. I was happy. I was excited. I wanted the wife and the baby and
future. Four months.” His lips pull tight, and he shakes his head once before
finally looking me in the eye. “It took me four months to learn she was
lying.”
The pain in his eyes is so clear, and I have the urge to cross the kitchen
and wrap my arms around him. Whoever this woman is, she did a number
on him, and it really makes me hate her for hurting him.
“She was never pregnant. She just wanted me to propose and shotgun
the wedding so I couldn't back out. And I bought it, you know? I was so
young and stupid and in love that I bought it. I didn't question a thing. All
of her doctor's appointments were on days I had games, and I never once
thought to question it because who actually thinks the person they love is
out to screw them over like that?”
He stares at me but not really at me. It's more like he's staring through
me, like he's back there in the past and hearing all over again that she lied
to him.
He looks so…broken.
“I'm sorry that happened to you,” I say quietly, and he snaps out of
whatever haze he's in.
He sniffles a few times, then shakes himself off like he's shaking off the
memories.
“It's why I assumed the worst about you—because I've been there
before—but I shouldn't have done that. I shouldn't have put my past on you
like that. I'm the one who's sorry.”
I nod. “Thank you for telling me.”
“Thank you for not lying.” He narrows his eyes. “Right?”
“I'd say my morning sickness the other night was a pretty good
indication that no, I am not lying.”
He nods a few times. “For what it's worth, I'm sorry you're in this
situation.”
“I'm sorry, too. I definitely did not plan this.”
He gives a halfhearted chuckle. “I definitely didn't either.”
I finish off the rest of my orange juice, and he takes the cup from me,
rinsing it and placing it in the dishwasher as well. I'm struck again by how
comfortable he seems to be in my apartment and how much it doesn't
bother me. Normally if somebody came over here and started acting like
this was their place too, I'd be annoyed, but—and maybe it's because I'm
carrying his baby—I don't feel that way with Lowell.
“How are you feeling?” he asks.
“Tired, nauseous. Like I have to pee a lot. I keep having weird dreams
of blonde babies who are babies but also look like old people.” I shudder.
“It's weird.”
I don't tell him the other recurring dream I've been having because it's
about him. I keep dreaming that he offers to pay me a million dollars to take
my baby and leave, to never contact him and to never, ever breathe a word
of it to anyone. It's had me waking up crying the last two nights, but I keep
that to myself.
He laughs. “And about the baby? How are you feeling about that?”
“Scared,” I say honestly. “Like really, really scared. But also…okay.”
He nods like he understands. “And you? How do you feel…about the
baby?”
“Scared. Like really, really scared,” he echoes.
I smile because it comforts me that he's also terrified by this new
adventure we got ourselves into.
“When did you find out?”
“Officially? On Monday. Unofficially? Last Friday.”
“How?”
“Hazelnut lattes and egg sandwiches.”
He tips his head, brows drawn together. “Hazelnut lattes and egg
sandwiches?”
“Yep. I was sitting at Cup of Joe's, and the smell of those two things
was so overwhelming that I vomited in my laptop bag. Honestly, if it
weren't for the old lady who commented on it, I wouldn't have thought
twice, and I still might not even know today. My period hasn't been normal
for a while because of all the stress with the divorce and everything, and
since we used protection, I never even suspected I might be pregnant.”
I feel kind of stupid for not being more in tune with my body or
questioning why I hadn't had a period in months, but there's nothing I can
do about that now.
My phone buzzes against the counter, and I know what it is before I
even look. I cross the kitchen to check it and can feel Lowell's eyes on me
the entire time.
“Did you need to take that?” he asks.
I shake my head. “It's not a phone call, it's an alarm. I have an
appointment.”
“For the baby?”
I nod. “Yep.”
“And you're going now?” I nod again. He pushes off the counter. “I'm
coming with you.”
“You don't have to.”
“You're right. I don't have to—I want to.”
“You…want to be part of this?”
He scowls more deeply than I've ever seen him scowl before. “You're
fucking kidding me, right? Of course I want to be part of this. Why
wouldn't I want to be?”
I shrug. “I don't know. We don't really know each other all that well. I
mean, yeah, we had this connection and shared a night together, but that's it.
It's not like either of us planned to continue seeing each other past that one
night. This…this is different than just bumping into one another after
having sex and doing the whole We've seen one another nude awkward
dance thing.”
“I remember.”
“This isn't something we just walk away from in the morning, Lowell.”
“I know.”
“This is a baby. This is forever.”
He growls. “I know what it means, Hollis, and I want it.”
“Are you sure?”
“Surer than I've ever been in my entire life.”
I try not to let my relief show. As much as I was prepared for the
opposite, I was hoping he'd say that.
“Okay. Then we should probably go. My appointment is in an hour.”
“Remind me again why we got here thirty minutes early when our
appointment was twenty minutes ago and we're still waiting?”
Our appointment.
I don't miss that he says that. The way he's inserted himself into this
makes my stomach flutter, and I don't know if that's a good thing or bad
thing yet.
He drove the exact speed limit on the way here, which drove me nuts.
Then he wouldn't let me out of the truck unless he opened the door, which
was also annoying, albeit a little cute.
He insisted on helping me down and carrying my purse. I really wanted
to remind him that I'm barely even pregnant and he was being extremely
extra, but every time I opened my mouth to say something, I couldn't get
the words out. I think it's because I'm just relieved he wants to be part of
this with me.
I don't have any crazy notions that we're suddenly going to be dating
and then get married and live happily ever after. That's not going to happen,
and I'm fine with it. But just the fact that he's here? That he's not running
away or trying to toss money at me to keep quiet about the baby?
Yeah, it makes my stomach flutter for sure.
“I'm sure it'll just be a few more minutes.”
He shoots me a look that says that's not likely. “We've been here
forever.”
“I know, but what can we do about it?”
He huffs, then before I know it, he's marching across the room.
“Lowell!” I whisper-yell at him, and he ignores me. “Cameron!” I hiss.
This time he turns around, his eyes sparking at the use of his first name
before he holds his hand up like he's trying to calm me. He saunters up to
the front desk with just enough cockiness, the kind that isn't so much that it
makes him look douchey. He rests his forearms—the forearms I know look
incredible—on the counter and leans across it toward the young nurse
sitting there.
“Hey there,” he says to her, using that same voice I've heard from him
before—slick and silky and all kinds of hot. “I was wondering if you could
tell me about how much longer it's going to be, Josie.”
He puts extra emphasis on her name, laying the charm on thick.
And it works. Red steals up her cheeks, and she bats her lashes up at
him.
“Let me just check really quick. What's the name again?”
“Lowell.” Again, more emphasis on the name. “Was kind of hoping we
could get in soon. I have hockey practice in a bit, and…” He trails off,
waiting for her to connect the dots.
If the way her eyes sparkle is any indication, she knows just who he is,
and I have a feeling we're about to be next. She turns to the computer, her
fingers flying over the keyboard, her mouse clicking rapidly.
And then… “Ah, you're in luck. The doctor will see you now.”
“Really? Wow. Thank you so much, Josie.”
He sends her that same panty-melting smile he gave me at Harper's
wedding, and I'd bet a hundred dollars that girl's chair is wet right now.
Lowell waves me over as she rises to buzz us in.
I lift my brows at him. “You're incorrigible, you know that?”
“I have no idea what you're talking about,” he says, holding the door
open for me. “Now let's go see our baby.”
Our baby.
I don't miss that he says it.
And I don't miss the way it makes me feel.

LOWELL
“I brought donuts.”
I hold up the baby blue box of this city's best-kept secret as a peace
offering for being a few minutes late.
Hollis looks surprised to see me. “You're here.”
“Yes?” I don't know why it's a question, but I also don't know why
she's questioning my presence. “We have an appointment, right?”
“I wasn't sure you wanted to go since I haven't seen you in a while…”
“As long as it doesn't interfere with hockey, then I'll be there. Always.”
I won't lie and say I haven't been avoiding her a little but that's because
I don't know how to be around her. Does she just want me hanging out over
at her place? Does she want to come to mine? Are we supposed to be
spending time together at all? I don't really know how to navigate this. I've
never had to before.
In fact, I haven't spent time with someone I've slept with since Celine,
and everyone knows how that turned out.
Hollis shakes her head. “You know what, never mind. It doesn't matter.
We should get going. We're late.”
“I know, and I'm sorry about that,” I say as she shoves out of her
apartment, then turns to lock it. “Which is why I brought donuts to make up
for it.”
“You're late, so you decided to make yourself more late by stopping to
pick up donuts?”
“Well, no. I had the thought to get donuts first, and when I was leaving
with the donuts in hand—completely on time, mind you—my truck
wouldn't start.”
She shoots me a look as we step into the elevator and she presses the
Lobby button. “Let me put on my shocked face that your POS truck
wouldn't start. Tell me, Lowell, just exactly how many layers of duct tape
are holding up your bumper?”
“Hey! I'll have you know Fiona takes great exception to being talked
about that way.”
“Fiona? You named your truck Fiona?”
“Yep. Princess Fiona to be more accurate. Like from Shrek.”
It takes her a moment to get it. “Because she's big and green and ugly.”
“Precisely.” I grin as we step out of the elevator. “Anyway, it's not her
fault,” I say, holding the door to her building open for her, trying to score
some points back. “It was mine. I knew better than to risk turning her off.
She gets kind of pissy when it's cold out.”
“I am so confused about why you're driving around in that hunk of
junk. Don't you make like six and a half million a year?”
“First, it's seven. Second, don't you dare call my baby a hunk of junk.
She has feelings, you know.”
Hollis rolls her eyes as I open her car door for her. “Need I remind
you”—she climbs into the truck, then points to her belly—“you'll have a
baby to worry about soon too.”
“I'll get a second car, then. I'm not giving Fiona up yet though. I can't.
Here.” I hand her the donuts and make sure she's safely in the vehicle
before closing the door and heading to my side. I climb behind the wheel of
my beloved albeit beat-up truck and crank the engine.
Just like at the donut truck, she fusses about it. It takes three tries, but
she eventually fires, and we're pulling out on the road.
I can feel Hollis' stare on me, and I glance over at her. “What?”
“Nothing.”
“Not nothing. What?”
She waves her hand toward the dashboard with an amused grin as if that
explains everything.
“What? It's part of her charm,” I explain. “Besides, she can't go until
I'm done playing hockey.”
“And how close are you to being done?”
“Like ten years if I'm lucky.”
“I don't think this truck can last ten more years.”
“Shh! Stop jinxing it!”
She snorts, then flips open the box of donuts. She plucks one out and
holds it up as if to ask me what kind.
“Boston cream.”
She nods, then takes a huge bite, and I nearly swerve off the road when
a bit of white cream dribbles down her chin. She wipes it away quickly
before I do something stupid like park this truck and haul her into my lap
and remind us just how we got into this situation in the first place.
“What's your big attachment to her anyway?”
Big attachment to…?
Oh, right—my truck.
I try to adjust myself as inconspicuously as possible and shrug. “I don't
know. She's just… Well, she's been there with me through it all. Got her
when I was sixteen. Paid for her myself after working and saving for two
years.” I pat the dash lovingly. “We've been through high school, college,
the draft, the NHL…everything.”
We pull up to a stoplight and I glance over to find Hollis' lips pulled
into a smile. “Is she your lucky charm, Lowell?”
“What? No.” I feel the tips of my ears heat at my lie. “I don't believe in
lucky charms.”
“Pretty sure being superstitious is like rule number one for playing
hockey.”
“Oh yeah? You a hockey expert now?”
She wrinkles her nose. “Nah. I'm actually not really into it.”
“You're… Excuse me?”
“Yeah, it's just not really my thing.”
“I… Wow. I'm speechless right now.”
“Sorry?”
“It's okay. I think. Maybe.” I slap my hand against the steering wheel.
“No, no. It's not okay actually. Like…how? How? Hockey is…”
“Eh.”
“Eh? Eh?” I shake my head. “I'm going to make you love it. Just
watch.”
“You can try, but I doubt it.”
“That's what your sister said too, now look at her. I'm pretty sure she
painted her face for at least half of the games last season.”
“That's because she's insane.”
“And you're not?”
“No.”
“Hmm. I seem to recall a certain someone punching a certain someone
else over their music being too loud. I'm pretty sure that qualifies as
insane.”
“Not if it was justified.”
I shake my head with a grin and focus on the road. The drive to the
doctor's isn't far, and we're pulling into the parking lot in no time. She was
worried about being late, but we're still thirty minutes early.
I shut the truck off and look over, just watching her as she stares out the
window. Her lips are slightly parted and there's a little wrinkle between her
brows with how deep in thought she is right now.
I want to reach over and run my finger over all the lines marring her
forehead, brush them away along with all her worries and doubts. But I'm
scared if I touch her, I won't be able to stop.
“You okay?” I ask quietly.
She jumps slightly, almost like she forgot I was even here, then clears
her throat. “Yeah. I just… Sorry. Got lost in thought for a minute.”
“What are you thinking about?”
“Honestly? Everything. How good these donuts taste. The appointment.
How we're going to raise a child together when you're a professional
hockey player and away half the year. How our whole lives are changing.
Just…everything.” She sighs, then tosses the half-eaten donut into the box,
looking exhausted by the day already.
I get it. It's a lot to take in.
“We don't have to think about all that now. We have time still. I think
right now, we just need to focus on getting to know each other better.”
She snorts. “Right. Because we don't really know each other beyond the
bedroom, do we?”
“I personally think the bedroom is a really good place to know
someone.”
“Yes, I am well aware of that fact about you.”
She smiles, but it's sad, and that makes me sad. I know she's worried
about so many things—and I am too—but I don't want today to be about all
the stress of what's to come.
“Tell me about the appointment today,” I say to distract her. “What's
going on?”
“We get to hear the baby's heartbeat.”
I sit up straight. “We do?” She nods. “Is that why you're nervous?”
Another nod. “Yes. I'm just…scared. Worried.”
“About what?”
“That we won't hear anything.”
Screw my rule about not touching her. I need to touch her right now. I
reach over and grab Hollis' hand, lacing our fingers together. She's
surprised by it at first, but it doesn't take her long to relax. Her shoulders
drop as she sags against the seat like just my touching her has somehow
taken some weight off her shoulders.
It makes me feel bad because it didn't even cross my mind that
something like that was a possibility. The thought of that happening makes
me sadder than I thought possible, and I'm surprised by that.
When everything happened with Celine, I put up walls. A lot of walls—
like all the walls when it came to anything serious. No relationships. No
promises of futures. Not even breakfast the morning after because it just set
too many expectations and I wasn't in the business of fulfilling them.
Since I met Hollis, I've felt the cracks in those bricks I stacked up so
high. And this crack? It just might be the biggest of all.
It's just occurred to me in this very moment that I want this baby. I
really want this baby. I don't want to walk into that doctor's office and there
not be a heartbeat.
“Great. Now you look scared too.”
“I am,” I say honestly, and her mouth drops open at my confession.
“But I also know we don't have a thing to worry about. We're going to go
in there and hear our baby's heartbeat, and everything is going to be just
fine.”
“How do you know?”
“Because I just do. And if I'm wrong, I'll let you hit me again. I know
how much you love doing that.”
“Ugh,” she groans. “I can't believe I'm having a baby with you.”
“Well, it's happening, so believe it, darlin'.” I wink at her, and she rolls
her eyes, but I see the smile playing on her lips. “Now come on, let's get
inside before we're really late.”
I push my door open but stop when I hear my name on her lips.
“Hey, Cameron?”
“Hmm?” I look back over at her.
She's peering up at me with unsure eyes.
She doesn't say anything for a long moment, just stares at me.
Then finally… “I'm glad it's you.”
I hate that my throat grows tight and my eyes burn with unshed tears.
Her words are like a punch to the gut and the absolute last thing I was
expecting her to say.
I clear my throat and run my tongue across my lips.
“I'm glad it's you too, Hollis.”
Pride swells in my chest as I stare out at the group of guys on the ice.
They look good. They look ready.
We're currently up three to one in our preseason game against Florida,
and I knew the moment my skates touched the ice that this is exactly what
I've been needing. To be out on the ice where I belong, to get my head back
on straight and get immersed in the game I live for.
“Strong legs out there already,” Collin comments, eyes trained on the
same thing I'm looking at.
“Attaboy, Miller!” I yell as he flies by. Coach is testing him on some
new lines this season, but he's looking good, looking sharp. “Keep this
energy up and I think it'll be a good season.”
“Spoken like a true captain,” Rhodes says. He looks left and right,
making sure nobody is paying us any attention, then leans in a bit. “You, uh,
tell Coach yet?”
I shake my head, looking over at the short guy with the round belly,
trying to picture the man who used to be an enforcer but finding it hard to
see. “Not yet.”
“You need to before the season starts.”
He's right. I know he is.
I'm just not really looking forward to walking into Coach's office and
telling him, “Hey, remember that time I proposed to my girl because she
was pregnant and we planned a wedding, and then it turned out she wasn't
pregnant and it was a whole big thing? Yeah, well, this time I knocked up a
one-night stand, and she's really knocked up this time. Oh, and, by the way,
she's due in April.”
He's going to shit a brick.
“I will.”
“Harper said things are going well,” Collin comments out of the side of
his mouth, eyes still tracking what's happening on the ice in front of us.
“Ryan even said you're going to appointments with her and got to hear
the heartbeat yesterday,” Rhodes adds.
“I heard you cried.”
“I did not,” I lie, because I swear to fuck I'm taking to my grave that
after I dropped Hollis off at her apartment, I cried on my drive home. I felt
stupid for it, but I still can't wrap my head around the fact that this is
happening.
With Celine, it was different when she came to me saying she was
pregnant. We'd been dating for months at that point. Sure, our relationship
was still in that early honeymoon phase and there was still a lot of learning
and growing to do, but we were committed to each other.
With Hollis, it's a whole different arena we're playing in now, and that's
what scares me the most about it.
“I heard you wept like a little baby,” Rhodes adds.
I did. “Fuck off.” I scowl at them. “Is that all you four do? Just sit
around and gab about my private life?”
“It's been the hot topic at the dinner table lately,” Collin says. “I mean,
you did get my sister-in-law pregnant. She and Harper talk a lot, you
know.”
“About anything good?” I'm only half-joking.
I'm curious as hell how the unfiltered version of Hollis is handling all of
this. One minute I'm fine, the next I'm mildly freaking out. If I'm this back
and forth, I can't imagine how she's feeling with the whole mix of
hormones on top of it.
He doesn't get the chance to answer, because Coach puts us out on the
ice. Rhodes and Collin pair up as per usual, and I fly by them, heading over
for a pass we've practiced a thousand times. The puck hits just where I need
it to, then I send it over to Smith, who taps it back as he tries to fight off
Florida's man.
They're so preoccupied with defending against Smith they don't even
realize I have the puck until the last minute, and by then it's too late. I bury
it past their goalie, and the small crowd here at home goes nuts.
Sticks go in the air, and Smith smacks his glove against mine in
celebration.
“Nice pass, man.”
“Nah. That was all you.” He's always so modest about his skills, but we
all know he wouldn't still be playing in the NHL at his age if he didn't have
the grit he does.
We clamber back onto the bench, catching our breaths, ready for our
next run.
“Hey.” Collin leans into me, his eyes locked on his defensemen. “What
you said before? About if what she says about you is good or bad?”
“Yeah?”
“It's good, man.”
I needed to hear that more than I thought I did.
“Good. That's…good.”
“But I swear, if you hurt her, you're dead.”
He doesn't have to be looking at me for me to know he's serious.
“I don't plan on it.”
And that's the truth.
You can't hurt what you don't touch.

HOLLIS & LOWELL
Lowell: I told Coach today.
Hollis: Did he freak?
Lowell: Only about the due date.
Hollis: What's wrong with the due date?
Lowell: We really need to talk about your lack of hockey
knowledge.
Lowell: April is playoffs.
Hollis: Oh. And those are important?
Lowell: …
Hollis: I'm kidding!
Hollis: I know it's important because it determines the Super
Bowl winner.
Lowell: I…I can't. I just can't.
Hollis: What? Something wrong? *bats lashes*
Lowell: I know you're just teasing, but words hurt, Hollis. They
really, really hurt.
Lowell: I'm going to make it my sole mission to make you love
hockey before this baby gets here.
Hollis: We'll see about that.
Lowell: How are you feeling?
Hollis: Fine.
Lowell: Just fine?
Hollis: I have a human growing inside of me that's depleting
all my energy and making me a hormonal psycho.
Hollis: HOW DO YOU THINK I'M DOING?!
Lowell: Fine.
Hollis: You really don't need to keep checking in on me every
day.
Lowell: It's MY human growing inside of you that's depleting
all your energy and making you a hormonal psycho.
Lowell: Do you really think I'm not going to be checking in on
you?
Hollis: Ugh. Fine. I get it.
Lowell: Thank you. And you're welcome.
Hollis: Welcome for what? This alien inside of me?
Lowell: Yes. But also for checking in on you.
Hollis: Please. Do NOT act like you're doing ME a favor. This
is all your fault.
Lowell: It takes two.
Hollis: Lowell…
Hollis: Please. I'm tired. I can't take any more sparring today.
Lowell: Can you just let me know if you actually keep some
food down?
Hollis: The doctor said it was fine and I shouldn't be worried.
Lowell: Okay. Then I'll worry for the both of us.
Lowell: Just text me, you stubborn woman, okay?
Hollis: Fine.
Lowell: Stop saying fine.
Hollis: Okay…
Hollis: Fine.
Lowell: Calliope
Hollis: No.
Lowell: Good.
Lowell: I hate that name.
Hollis: Then why did you suggest it?
Lowell: Just making sure we're on the same page.
Hollis: Speaking of page…
Hollis: What about Paige?
Lowell: I'm…indifferent.
Hollis: *eye-roll emoji*
Hollis: Of course you are.
Lowell: I have suggested no less than five names to you this
week and this is the first time I've rejected one of yours and I
get an OF COURSE?!
Lowell: Also, please note it wasn't an outright no. I just said
I'm indifferent.
Hollis: That basically means no.
Lowell: *blinks*
Hollis: *blinks faster*
Lowell: *blinks hard AND faster*
Hollis: It's really rude of you to argue with a pregnant woman,
you know. It causes stress for the baby.
Lowell: Leave her out of this.
Hollis: Or him.
Hollis: We still don't know yet.
Lowell: It's a girl. I can feel it.
Hollis: Oh, can you? Can you feel it? Even when it's not inside
your body stealing all of your comfort and joy?
Lowell: Someone is a bit dramatic, no?
Lowell: Would it bring you joy if I had some food delivered?
Hollis: It would bring me joy if you left me alone.
Hollis: And sent a cheeseburger.
Lowell: You still pissed?
Hollis: Yes.
Lowell: Why?
Hollis: A SALAD, LOWELL. You sent me a salad. That's just…
wrong. On many levels.
Lowell: One, I sent a salad because YOU were the one
complaining about weight gain on the phone the other night.
Lowell: Two, I was reading a baby book and they said greasy
foods probably aren't the best to consume. They're hard to
digest. I did you a favor.
Hollis: Well, do me another favor—don't do me any more
favors!
Lowell: That's a very counterproductive request, don't you
think?
Hollis: Remember when I told you I didn't like you?
Lowell: Yes.
Hollis: Well, somehow, I like you even less today.
Lowell: I'll remember that for when I happen across a drivethru and don't order you any ice cream.
Hollis: You wouldn't dare.
Lowell: Sorry. I can't text. I'm busy ordering food.
Hollis: Shut up and get me chocolate.
Hollis: NO! Swirl.
Hollis: Wait. Chocolate.
Hollis: Lowell?
Lowell: This is an automated message. The person you are
trying to reach is currently in the drive-thru waiting on one
small ice cream for nobody else but himself. Please try again
later.
Hollis: I hate you.
Lowell: You wish.
Hollis: Sucks you guys lost tonight.
Lowell: You watched the game?
Hollis: No. Harper did.
Hollis: I just happened to be there.
Lowell: You totally watched.
Hollis: Did not. I don't even like hockey, remember?
Lowell: Take that back.
Hollis: It's boring.
Lowell: Hollis…
Hollis: And slow.
Lowell: Slow?! Are you kidding me? I can literally skate faster
than the speed limit in my neighborhood!
Lowell: I can't believe I'm having a baby with a hockey hater.
I'm so ashamed of myself.
Hollis: You are not.
Lowell: You're right. But I should be.
Lowell: Did you know that our baby is the size of a pair of
baby booties?
Lowell: Whatever those are.
Hollis: Are you looking at baby websites again?
Lowell: Yes. Since I'm not there, I like to know what you're
experiencing.
Hollis: That's…actually kind of sweet.
Lowell: I know.
Lowell: It's also still smaller than the average dick, but I'll have
to let Miller know that the baby is catching up to him fast.
Hollis: Umm…excuse me?
Hollis: Like a penis?
Lowell: Yeah.
Hollis: Did you just compare our child to a penis? A PENIS?
Lowell: Again, yeah.
Hollis: How… What… Why do you know the size of the
average dick?
Lowell: All guys know it instinctually.
Lowell: It's a thing. Trust me.
Lowell: Speaking of…how do we feel about Dick?
Hollis: I take it back. You're not sweet.
Lowell: I'm guessing Richard is out of the question, then, too?
Lowell: Hollis?
Lowell: Fine. I'll stop. But it's going to be really HARD to do.
Hollis: If you think I'm above kneeing you in the balls, I'm not.
Lowell: Oh, I am very well aware of all the pain you enjoy
inflicting on me.
Hollis: Good. Now remember that the next time you compare
our child to a penis.

HOLLIS
“So, are you excited about your first professional hockey game?”
Not that I'd admit it to him anytime soon, but Lowell's project to make
me love hockey by the time the baby gets here is actually moving along a
lot faster than I thought it would.
Though I do think I owe more of the credit to Harper than I do to him.
She's been making me watch all the preseason games and explaining
everything to me. I still don't really understand it, but I will admit it's fun to
watch.
“I…think so?”
I look around the big, nearly empty arena with wide eyes. Most people
are still milling about the concourse buying merch and filling up on beer
and food before warm-ups begin. This place is huge, and I can't believe it's
about to be packed with 20,000 screaming hockey fans.
I'm proud of myself for keeping my hormones in check because I've
only had to excuse myself to the bathroom one time for crying when I came
across a little girl with dark hair and pigtails who had LOWELL and the
number 55 stitched across her back. She was so cute, and all I could think
was… That could be mine.
“Just wait until the game starts. You're going to totally fall in love with
it then,” my sister says. “I didn't think I'd ever be into it, and now I love it.”
I want to point out that she most likely loves it so much because her
husband plays, but I don't.
“And it's going to make you so horny,” Ryan adds. “Like, unbelievably
so. Your sex drive is probably already off the charts, so I bet by the time we
get done with this game, you are going to want to climb your man like a
pole.”
I'm a little surprised by how right she is about my sex drive being
totally off the charts. I have woken up no less than four times this week
from very vivid sex dreams—so vivid I've had to get myself off each time
or else there was no way I was going to be able to go back to sleep. I know
they say some women's sexual desires can be really intense during
pregnancy, but I did not expect it to be that intense.
Just like I did not expect the star of my dreams to be Lowell, but oh has
he been the star.
The most frustrating part of it all is that no matter how hot my dreams
are, they still pale in comparison to the real thing, and that's something I
have to live with every day.
“He's not my man.”
Ryan and Harper look at each other and do very little to conceal their
smirks.
“He's not my man,” I insist, annoyed by their smiles. “There is nothing
remotely relationship-y or intimate happening between us. We're just
friends.”
“Much to your vagina's dismay, I'm sure. I bet it would love to be
dicked down by him.”
“Ryan!” Harper hisses, looking around to make sure nobody heard her.
“Sorry. Ignore me. Hockey makes me horny, and I'm not even the
pregnant one. It's just so”—she shimmies her shoulders—“hot.”
“She always gets like this during the game,” Harper explains. “I swear,
she and Rhodes go at it like rabbits when it's over.”
“I can definitely confirm that, but don't you dare sit there judging me
like that when you know you and Collin do the same.”
Harper's cheeks stain red, not denying it at all.
“Can we please stop talking about sex? Ryan was right—my libido is a
little nuts right now and I can't do anything about it, so hush.”
“Why can't you do anything?”
I point to my stomach. “Um, hello.”
“Yeah, so?”
“Who is going to want to sleep with a pregnant woman?”
“Um, probably your baby daddy.”
I wrinkle my nose. “I'm not sleeping with Lowell.”
“Why? Scared he'll get you pregnant?”
I roll my eyes. “No. I'm not sleeping with him because he got me
pregnant.”
“Okay…” She draws the word out, clearly confused.
I sigh. “I can't sleep with him because we're not together, Harper. Yes,
he got me pregnant, but we're not dating or anything.”
“Remind me again why you're not.”
“Because he doesn't do serious.”
“I'd say having a baby together is pretty serious, Hollis.”
“You're right. It is—but it's not like this was planned. We weren't even
supposed to see each other again.”
“But now you are seeing each other again and you're pregnant with his
baby.”
“Yeah…”
“So, then, what's the big deal if you sleep together? You're not going to
hook up with other people while you're pregnant, are you?”
“No! Of course not!”
“Okay. Then…”
“Then what?”
“Then ride that dick while you can!” Ryan says.
Harper hitches her thumb toward Ryan. “Yeah, what she said.”
“I… Okay. I'll take that into consideration.”
I won't take it into consideration though. Lowell and I haven't really
talked about our relationship or exactly how it is we're going to raise this
baby, but I don't think we need to. He was clear from the start—he doesn't
want a relationship. He already made the mistake of throwing himself into
something he wasn't entirely ready for once, and he got hurt. He's not going
to make that same mistake again.
The roar of the crowd pulls our attention, and Comets start spilling out
for warm-ups, starting with their goalie. They step onto the ice one by one
and skate in circles on the half of the rink closest to us.
Collin and Rhodes almost immediately come over to right in front of
where we're sitting, and it is absolutely adorable to watch Harper and Ryan
fangirl over their husbands while wearing their numbers on their back.
A sudden rush of jealousy rises in me. I don't understand what it means
or where it's coming from, so I push it down and pretend it never happened,
then focus my attention back to the ice.
I take it all in, absolutely mesmerized by everything that's happening. I
have no idea how they are all successfully ignoring the people beating on
the glass and trying to get their attention with signs and screams and
everything else while also warming up for the game. How they're blocking
it out, I have no clue, but it's impressive.
Even though I've only seen pictures of him in uniform and probably
couldn't pick him out if I tried, I know the moment Lowell steps onto the
ice because the Comets fans go nuts for their captain.
But he doesn't pay any attention to them.
No.
He looks at me.
In fact, he skates right over to me and stands at the glass, that stupid
grin of his that is really starting to grow on me firmly in place. He tips his
head and mouths one word: Good?
I nod, loving that even when he's supposed to be focusing on his game,
he's worried about me and the baby.
His grin widens, satisfied with that answer. His eyes drift down the front
of me, lingering on my chest and then my belly—both of which are starting
to grow—before he drags his gaze back up to my face. His stare has me
wiggling against my seat.
He taps the glass twice with the end of his stick, then skates away.
I can feel eyes on me, and I turn to find Harper staring holes into the
side of my head.
“What?” I ask.
She smiles, shaking her head slowly before turning her attention back to
the ice.
But not before I hear her murmur, “Just friends my ass.”
Ryan was right.
Very, very right.
The final buzzer just sounded, and I am hornier than ever. Watching
grown men skate around after a puck and shove on each other shouldn't be
hot, not in the least. But somehow…it is.
Like really, really hot.
“Well…” Ryan says, fanning herself. “That was nice.”
I laugh, because same.
“We going to Slapshots?” Harper asks.
“What's Slapshots?”
“A sports bar that's just around the corner. They have a tradition of
going after every home opener,” Ryan says. “We can walk there. The guys
will meet up with us in a bit after all the hubbub.”
So that's what we do. We make our way a few blocks over and grab a
table, and I learn that “hubbub” means their post-game interviews, a quick
workout—which totally blows my mind—and reviewing what went wrong
and what went right.
I'd say since they finished the game five to one and won the 15th
consecutive home opener of their existence, there was a lot that went right.
We're not seated at Slapshots long before the guys file in. Everyone
cheers when they're spotted, then returns to their respective drinks, and I
like that they have a place they can hang out like this and not be bothered
for the most part.
The bartender brings over several beers before the guys even have a
chance to sit down, already knowing what they want.
“Hey, Rod. Can we get some sparkling water with lemon whenever you
get the chance?”
He looks confused by Lowell's request, but when Lowell nods toward
me, understanding dawns, and he nods, taking off to prepare the drink.
“Thanks,” I say to Lowell as he takes the empty seat next to me, trying
hard to ignore how good he looks and smells right now. He has a ballcap
flipped backward and is wearing jeans and a shirt with #55 on the chest.
Simple, but with the confidence and high he's riding after winning tonight,
he looks ten times hotter.
Or maybe that's just the horniness talking again.
He winks in response, and I have to fan myself because my face
instantly heats.
“You good?”
“Yeah, just…hot. And a little tired.”
“We don't have to stay long, just a beer and then we can go. I was going
to ask if you wanted to come back to my place tonight. Just to…you
know…check it out, make sure it's all good for the baby and everything,”
he rushes out. “But if you're too tired—”
“I'm not,” I say way too quickly. “I'm not too tired. That sounds…good.
Nice.”
“Good. Nice.” He smirks. “Okay.”
And that's exactly what we do.
Lowell has one beer before pushing away from the table, holding his
hand my way. “You ready?”
I nod and slip my hand into his, allowing him to help me from the chair.
I try to ignore the fact that he doesn't let my hand go.
“We're heading out,” he announces to the table.
“Aww, already?” Miller complains, poking his bottom lip out. “Boo.”
“Sorry. I need to get my girls home. They're tired.”
Harper perks up at his words. “Girls?!”
“Ignore him. We don't know what we're having yet. He just thinks he
knows it's a girl.”
“Because it is,” Lowell insists.
I ignore him. “We've decided to wait to find out at the twenty-week
mark.”
“My money is on a boy,” Collin says.
“Nah. I say girl,” Rhodes chimes in.
“Team girl here too,” Miller agrees.
“You're officially outnumbered.” Lowell places his hand on my belly.
“You hear that? You had better be a girl or you're grounded.”
I gape at him.
It's the first time he's touched my stomach, and the first time he's talked
to the baby. It surprises me—not just because we're in public and everyone
is definitely gawking at us now, but because he does it with such ease, like
it's the most natural thing in the world to him.
I like that it's natural. I like that it's natural a little too much.
“What?” he asks, and I realize I'm still staring at him.
“Nothing.” I tear my eyes from his as I blink back the tears threatening
to spill over. “Let's get out of here.”
Lowell's house is a lot more modest than I pictured it being. He's an NHL
player who makes more in a year than I'll probably ever see in a lifetime,
and I thought his house would be stories tall on sprawling land with a
million windows and marble floors.
Instead, he lives in a gated community on about two acres, and not a
single home is gawdy or lavish. It just looks like a normal community for
normal everyday people.
“I like your new car,” I tell him, running my hands over the interior of
his brand-new Audi SUV.
“I promised you I'd get a new one for the baby.”
I grin because he did promise that, and I love that he kept his promise.
“Don't worry, Fiona is tucked safely in my garage. Figured it was too
cold for her tonight.”
“Oh, phew. I was so worried about her.”
“I know you were.”
He shoots me a grin as he pulls into a short driveway and clicks a button
so the garage opens.
Maybe I'm just really ignorant on what hockey players do with their
money, but I definitely didn't expect his garage to house his truck and that's
it.
No, wait—that looks like a bag of golf clubs tucked back in the corner.
We climb out of the SUV, and he leads me into the house via the
kitchen. A few smart lights kick on when we enter, and the first thing I
notice is the open concept, which leaves the living room visible from every
angle in the spacious cooking area. Despite the navy blue cabinets and sleek
black granite countertops, the kitchen is bright and open. I bet it's even
more gorgeous in the daytime. The living area contains a couch, a TV
mounted to the wall, and two bookshelves lined with odds and ends.
Everything is so…modest.
“Not what you were expecting?” he asks as I take it all in.
“Not at all,” I admit. “I thought there would be more gold.”
He laughs. “Nah. More of a silver guy myself.”
I grin. “It's a really nice house, Lowell.”
“Thank you. I'd like to take all the credit for it, but I had a designer do it
all. I just wanted something simple and sleek that didn't cost an arm and a
leg in case I ever play somewhere else.”
The possibility of that never even crossed my mind, and my heart
begins to race thinking about him moving away.
“Is that something that's going to happen?”
“I plan to Sidney Crosby my career and play for one team, but it doesn't
mean it's not a possibility.”
My hand instinctively goes to my belly as if to protect my baby from
that heartbreak.
He doesn't miss it.
“Follow me. I have something to show you.”
He leads me down a dark hallway, not stopping until he reaches the
door at the very end.
I lift my brows at him, curious.
“I know we haven't really discussed the mechanics of this whole
situation—something we should probably sit down and do—but I've been
working on something. You know…just in case.”
He pushes the door open and flips on the light.
My jaw drops, unable to believe what I'm seeing.
It's a nursery.
Not just any nursery either—it's a beautiful one with a custom design of
a midnight mountain-scape stenciled on the wall. The furniture is a soft
gray and there are touches of gold and yellow throughout. There's a halfbuilt crib in the middle of it all, which tells me he's the one putting
everything together himself.
“You did this?” I ask, my eyes darting everywhere, not wanting to miss
a single detail.
“Yeah. I've, uh, been working on it since the night you told me.”
I don't know what I was expecting him to say, but it wasn't that.
“You…have?” He nods. “But you didn't… You said… You…”
“Panicked. I panicked, but not once in that entire conversation did I say
I didn't want the baby or want to be part of their life. I have always wanted
that, and I will always want it.” He steps into me, his hands finding my
bump for the second time tonight. He bends at the knees to meet my eyes.
“This is forever, Hollis, and I'm all in.”
One.
Two.
Three.
That's how many seconds I last before I crush my mouth to his.

LOWELL
When I asked Hollis to come back to my place tonight, it wasn't for this. I
wanted to show her that I'm ready, that I'm preparing.
I didn't mean for this to happen.
She kisses me harder, almost like if she does, I'll respond. I don't
respond because I can't help but think of the last time she kissed me when
she shouldn't have.
I place my hands on her hips, and she takes it as a sign, pressing into me
more. For just a moment, I give in, pressing her back against the nearest
wall and devouring her. I slide my knee between her legs, and she moans,
rubbing herself against it.
I know it's wrong and we shouldn't be doing this, but I can't resist. I
want to kiss her. I want to kiss her so damn badly. I have since the moment I
saw her sitting at the bar the night she told me she's pregnant. I wanted to
sprint across that restaurant and pull her into my arms and make up for
leaving her behind, and I've wanted to kiss her every day since then.
But I haven't because that's not what this is about right now. It's about
the baby, not us.
I wrench my mouth away and she follows, trying to kiss me again, but I
hold her back firmly.
Her eyes are glassy, her breaths coming in short spurts as she blinks up
at me. “What's wrong?”
“That's… This isn't why I brought you here.”
“That's sweet, really, but I'm a big girl. I want this.”
“But what if I don't?”
Her face drops. “Is it… Is it because I'm pregnant?”
“What?! No, no. That's not it at all. Hollis, you're…” Incredible.
Gorgeous. Courageous. “It's not because you're pregnant.”
She peers up at me, her eyes shiny still, but this time with unshed tears.
Her chin wobbles a little as she asks, “Then what is it?”
“It's just…” I press my forehead against hers, squeezing my eyes shut.
“This is already complicated.”
“What is?”
“This…us…”
“I know.” She sighs. “I know. It's just I…ache.”
It's like her words are tethered to my cock because the moment they
leave her lips, I'm harder than I've ever been before. I couldn't stop myself
if I tried.
“Please, Cameron.” She moves her hips, her eyes fluttering shut as she
rocks herself against my jean-clad thigh. “Please. It doesn't have to mean
anything. I just need something. Anything.”
I can be something.
I can be anything.
“I need you.”
Three words—three words and all the excuses I had fly right out the
window.
Without another word, I slam my mouth to hers, then scoop her into my
arms and march us through the house. I don't stop kissing her and I don't
stop walking until I reach my bedroom. Not even when I lay her on the bed
and fit myself between her legs do I stop. I don't stop until she's fucking
herself on my thigh and crying for release.
“More,” she begs. “I need more. Please.”
I kiss my way down her throat and sit back, lifting her along with me.
As much as I love seeing her wear my number, I need to see her even more.
I peel her t-shirt from her body and toss the material aside, gently pushing
her back down. Her brown hair fans around her, her tits, which are filling
out more and more, spilling from the cups of her bra.
All I can do is stare because she's fucking gorgeous. She's gorgeous just
like this, and all I can think about is how much further she has to go and
how I can't wait to watch her grow my child.
I love the idea so much that I kiss her, thanking her with my lips in a
way I don't know how to do with my words. It's not long before she's
rubbing herself against my thigh again, and I know if I don't get her relief
soon, she's going to burst.
I kiss my way down her throat and past her breasts, which I promise to
spend more time on later. I press kisses over her belly, promising to worship
that later too, and I don't stop until I hit the waistband of her jeans.
Then, I laugh.
“What's so funny?” she asks, sitting up to look at what I'm seeing.
There's a small hairband holding the button of her jeans done because
her belly is too big to fit. It's ridiculous and adorable.
“Oh,” she murmurs sheepishly. “That.”
“Yeah, that.” My shoulders shake harder.
She glowers and shoves at my shoulder. “Shut up! It's not funny. All of
my good jeans were in the wash, and I couldn't get these to button.” She
groans, then shoves me again. “Just forget it.”
She tries to wiggle off the bed, but I don't budge that easily.
“Move,” she demands.
“No,” I say, grabbing her wrists when she starts beating on my chest. I
push until her back hits the bed, then bring her arms up over her head and
hold them there.
“Let me go, Lowell.”
“Oh, so I'm back to being Lowell now?”
“Yes, because you're a jerk.”
“I am not.”
“Are too.”
“Am not. Now stop moving.”
“You are so annoying. You're—”
I kiss the insult from her lips, and it takes all of two seconds before
she's moaning and rubbing against me again. My cock is throbbing behind
the zipper of my jeans, and I think I need a release just as bad as she does.
But not yet.
She groans when I pull my mouth from hers and trace the same path
from before down her neck and over her breasts and belly. This time, the
only reason I stop is to undo the makeshift button on her jeans.
She shoves onto her elbows to look at me. “What are you doing?” she
mutters, her voice scratchy with lust.
“Tasting you.” I peer up at her. “I can taste you, right?”
She gulps, trapping her bottom lip between her teeth with a nod.
I slide her jeans from her legs, trying not to laugh at her urgency to help
me, then reposition myself between them, swiping my tongue over her
before she has the chance to protest again.
“Unghhh,” she cries out, arching off the bed. “Oh god. More.”
And I oblige.
I spread her pussy with my tongue, licking and sucking and getting my
fill until she's practically fucking my face. Her hands crash into my hair,
holding me to her as she has her way with me, and I've never been so happy
to be used in my entire life. Her legs begin to shake, and I know she's close.
I keep the same pressure applied with my tongue as I slowly slide two
fingers inside of her. I hook them up, and that's all it takes.
“Cameron…” she moans, her legs shaking around my head as she
comes apart.
I wait for her legs to stop trembling before I slip my fingers out of her
and kiss my way back up her body. She's coated in a light sheen of sweat,
and her hair is a mess. It reminds me of the first night we had together, and
for a moment, I wish I had never walked away.
I roll until I'm on my back, dragging her along with me. She rests her
head on my chest and lets out a contented sigh.
“Give me five minutes,” she promises, her words sleepy and slurred.
Those five minutes never come and neither do I, but I've never been
more satisfied.
“You can't be serious.”
“I am.”
Hollis puts her hands on her hips, and I try not to stare too long at the
baby bump that's becoming more and more obvious every day.
It's not that I don't want to stare—I really want to—but if I stare too
long, I'm afraid I'll do something like rush across her apartment and toss
her up on the counter and have my way with her. Seeing my child grow
inside her is doing something to me that I never expected.
I like it. A lot.
It's why I'm over here all the damn time now and can't remember the
last time I spent more than one night in my own bed.
“You really don't want to find out?”
“No.” She shakes her head, the loose bun on top of it bobbing around as
she moves through the kitchen. “I want to be surprised. You're more than
welcome to find out, but I don't want to know.”
“I'm surprised.”
“Why?”
I shrug. “I don't know. I just figured you had all these grandiose plans
of prepping a baby room with a theme and colors and everything else.”
“I did.” I tip my head, not understanding what she's getting at. “Before,
I mean,” she elaborates. “With Thad.”
Right. Her ex. Her ex who is a huge piece of shit and who I want to
punch.
“Why not now, then?”
“I…I don't know. Maybe I'm picking up hockey superstitions or
something, but since none of this is what I had planned for my life, I figured
I might as well keep that going and just be surprised.”
Everything over the last few months has been so insane that I almost
forgot Hollis hasn't even been divorced for six months. I can't imagine how
she must be feeling going from happily married to divorced to pregnant by
a guy she barely knows all in the span of a year.
It has to be taking a mental toll on her.
“You want to know what I think?” I ask as she sets her fresh glass of
water down on the table, climbs back into her spot on the couch, and pulls
her computer back into her lap.
It's a game day for me, and sometime over the last few weeks, this has
become our routine until I have to be at the rink. I come over and we lie
around on the couch. Sometimes she'll work, sometimes I'll read,
sometimes we'll talk, but mostly it's just about spending time together.
“What's that?”
“You just don't want to see if I'm right and it's a girl.”
“Well, do you want to know what I think?”
“What's that?” I echo.
“I think I need to pee.”
I mock gasp. “I am shocked. Shocked!”
“Always right when I sit down too.” She rolls her eyes, setting her
laptop aside, then rises from the couch. She teeters a bit, and I'm on my feet
in an instant to catch her.
I grip her waist, holding her steady. “You okay?”
“Yeah,” she says, “just a bit wobbly.” She points to her belly. “Still
getting used to this big thing.”
“It's not big.”
“Don't try to placate me, Lowell. I'm big.”
“You're not. You look just the size of a bell pepper, or a bottle of baby
shampoo. Take your pick.” Her brows scrunch together at my words. “Baby
sites—they're weird.”
“Ah.” She nods, pushing away. “Be right back.”
She slowly makes her way to the bathroom, and I don't dare sit down
until she's shut the door behind her.
I don't like that she's unstable, but I guess I can also understand. Her
body is changing so much every single day even if she can't always see it.
It's…well, kind of fucking amazing if you ask me.
I flop back down on the couch and nearly knock her laptop off the
cushion with the force. I manage to grab it before it crashes to the floor and,
in the process, wake it up.
I know I shouldn't look. It's a total invasion of privacy.
But I do it anyway because pulled up on the screen is an apartment, and
I think that might involve me just a little bit.
Is she thinking of moving? She hasn't mentioned it and I just forgot, has
she?
I click around the page and check out the photos. It's…fine. Not exactly
what I would want to live in, but then again, I have the luxury of being
picky.
It's a two-bedroom and the rent is almost double what she's paying here,
not to mention it's on the complete opposite side of town…and the arena,
which means I'll be farther away from her and the baby.
I don't want to be farther away from her or the baby.
I…
Oh shit.
Does she want me to ask her to move in with me?
I like being with her. I like touching her. And I definitely like what we
did last week at my house.
But that's all different than actually being in a relationship.
I'm not sure I'm ready for that even if we are having a baby together.
It's one thing to love and care for the baby growing inside her. The baby
can't hurt me. All the baby will know is how to love me.
But Hollis…she can do so much more damage than that. I'm not sure
I'm ready to give anyone that power yet.
I hear the toilet flush, then the water turn on, so I click back to the first
photo and drop the laptop back where she had it. I do my very best not to
look guilty when she comes out of the bathroom, pretending to scroll
through something on my phone.
“Ah, so much better. For like twenty minutes, I mean.” She laughs at
her own joke as she climbs back onto the couch.
I halfheartedly smile at her. She turns her attention back to her laptop.
Click.
Scroll.
Click.
Scroll.
I don't stop watching her.
I can't stop watching her.
She notices.
“Do you remember at Harper and Collin's wedding when I ordered that
chocolate milk and you didn't make fun of me for it?”
“Yes.”
“And remember how Emilia came over and she and I danced?”
“Yes. That's when I discovered you're a liar who loves Queen.”
“Everybody loves Queen, Lowell. I'm pretty sure that's an actual law
somewhere.”
“I don't think that's how that works, but okay. Why are you asking
about the wedding?”
“I was just wondering if you remember when you sat at the bar staring
at me, watching me dance for like twenty minutes like a complete creep.”
“You knew I was watching you?”
“You're kind of hard to ignore.” She lifts a brow. “Anyway, I just
wanted you to know you're doing it again.”
“Doing what again?”
“Staring at me like a creep.”
Fuck.
“It's your beauty. I can't get enough of it.”
It's true, but it's not the only reason I'm staring. I'm staring because I'm
scared she wants more and I might not be able to give it to her.
She snorts. “I hope hockey covers your vision insurance. You clearly
need your eyes checked.”
I frown. That's the second time just today that she's commented on her
body, and I wonder if it's because she's embarrassed about the changes.
I sigh, then reach over and push her computer closed, stealing it right
out of her hands.
“Hey! I was reading something!”
I set the laptop on the table. “What were you reading?”
“A…uh…an article! Ha!”
“Oh yeah?” I lift a challenging brow. “About what?”
“How to get away with murdering your baby daddy.”
I can't help but grin.
Baby daddy.
Daddy.
I'm going to be a dad.
It's the first time I've heard the word in reference to me, and I like it—
and not in a kinky way. I'm going to be some little boy or little girl's daddy,
and I don't think it's fully sunk in yet. I'm not sure it will sink in until the
baby is here.
It's…scary.
And exciting too.
But mostly scary.
I shake my head, pushing away all the thoughts trying to intrude, then
focus back on the task at hand: crawling across the couch until I'm lying on
top of her and we're fitted perfectly against one another.
“You can't murder me.”
“You're right. Collin already called dibs.”
“I can take Collin.”
“Uh, the busted lip you had a while back says otherwise.”
“No. The busted lip I had says I deserved what I got, not that I couldn't
take him.”
“Hmm. I'm betting on Collin.”
“Oh?” I ask, dropping my head and running my nose along her jawline,
taking in the scent that's completely her. “Is that so?”
“Mmm”—she moans when I run my tongue over the column of her
neck, unable to stop myself from tasting her—“hmm. That's s-so.”
I chuckle against her, loving how responsive she is. I press my hips into
her, letting her feel everything she's doing to me, letting her feel that even if
she thinks she's not attractive, I do.
I keep pressing kisses along her neck and her collarbone and her cheek
and everything I can except for her mouth, all while I rock my hips into her.
She whimpers every time my cock brushes just right between her legs, and
she arches her hips up, seeking more contact.
“Hey, Hollis?”
“Hmm?”
I rub against her again. Another moan. I drag my lips away from her
body and pull back, breaking our contact.
This time when she whimpers, it's pained.
“No. What are you doing? I—”
“Hush,” I interrupt, staring down at her. “I need you to listen to me,
okay?”
“Okay,” she says, and I laugh because that is not hushing.
She tucks her lips together, a promise not to say anything else.
“You're beautiful.” She opens her mouth, but I cut her off with a sharp
glare and she clamps her mouth shut. “Everything about you is beautiful,
even the parts you don't like. Hell, especially the parts you don't like.
Those are my favorite because they need the extra love.”
A smile starts to slip across her lips.
“What you're doing…growing this baby inside of you…it's magical.
Sexy. You're sexy. I need you to realize that, okay? I need you to realize that
seeing your stomach grow and knowing that's my baby in there is the
hottest thing I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing.”
She doesn't say anything, but she doesn't have to. I can see the tears
sliding out of her eyes and into her hair.
“So the next time you decide to talk crap about yourself, I want you to
remember that every time you do, my boner dies, and that's just a waste of a
good boner.”
A laugh bubbles out of her, and I capture it with a kiss, wanting to keep
it for myself. I might not be able to give her everything she needs, like a
relationship or a welcome into my home, but I can give her this right now.
I kiss her until my alarm goes off, reminding me I need to be at the rink
soon.
Then I kiss her some more. And once again just before I walk out the
door.
“If we win tonight,” I tell her, “that's becoming my pregame ritual. It
has to—for science.”
She laughs and shakes her head. “Damn hockey players and their
superstitions.”
That night, we beat Seattle four to zero.
I never understood it before when the dads on the team would complain
about being away from their wives and kids, but I get it now, and I have
never been more excited for a plane to land in my life. I'm so damn excited
I almost become one of those people—the clapper when the pilot
successfully lands.
I don't care.
I don't care because I miss Hollis and I need to see her.
I realize I'm probably growing way too comfortable spending time with
her, but I can't stay away. Whenever we're not together, I want to be.
Whenever we are together, I never want to leave. I just like being around
her, and it's not even all entirely related to her carrying my child.
I just like her.
I get it now, what Smith was talking about when he said he was learning
what matters and what doesn't, what was missing and what wasn't.
Hollis is what I've been missing.
I realize that now as I stumble into her apartment building just after two
AM. Our plane landed not too long ago, and though I kept telling myself it
was too late to bother her and just needed to go home, I drove here anyway.
Even though I kept telling myself to turn around and not get on the elevator,
I did it anyway, and even though I promised myself I wouldn't knock on her
door, that's exactly what I'm doing right now.
I rap my knuckles against the wood, and it's only seconds until I hear a
shuffling coming from inside the apartment.
Hollis pulls the door open. Though her hair is rumpled, she doesn't look
like she was sleeping at all. In fact, it looks like she was waiting up.
For me.
She's wearing a thin t-shirt that's pulled tight over her stomach, which I
swear is even bigger than it was the last time I saw her. Her tits—which
have gone up at least half a cup size—are straining against the fabric so
much that her nipples are nearly visible through it. She's wearing a pair of
tiny shorts and a look in her eye that says she's hungry…and not for food.
My cock instantly springs to life, straining against the dress slacks I
didn't bother changing out of.
“Hi,” she says quietly, her lips tipping up in the corner.
I grin back. “Hey.”
She doesn't move, and I don't either.
Then suddenly we're both moving at once.
I have no idea who reaches for who first, but one second I'm standing
outside her apartment, and the next I'm inside with her against the wall, her
legs wrapped around me, our mouths fused together like kissing each other
is what they were made for.
Not kissing her for four days felt like hell.
Kissing her for four seconds feels like heaven.
And I have no idea how I'm going to stop.

HOLLIS
I shouldn't be waiting up for Lowell for several reasons.
1. I don't know what time he'll be getting back to North Carolina.
2. I have no idea if he's coming over here because it's not something
we've discussed.
3. We're not together.
4. I'm getting too attached and I know I am.
Despite knowing all of this, I'm waiting up anyway.
I miss him. I miss hanging out with him and laughing with him. I miss
scrolling through baby websites with him, getting ourselves all worked up
over what's to come. I just miss…him.
Something changed between us that night at his house. Not just
physically, but emotionally too. It was the first time I really got to see how
invested in this he truly is. You can say you're going to do something all
you want, but actions speak louder than words, and Lowell's action of
building our baby a room definitely spoke volumes.
A knock sounds at my door, and I jump off the couch before I can think
too much about why I'm so excited by the idea of seeing Lowell, then
swing the door open.
A lot of the guys tend to change out of their suits when they're on the
plane back home, but Lowell didn't tonight. He's wearing a perfectly
tailored dark gray suit that makes his green eyes look even more captivating
and a smirk that says he's come over for a reason.
He rakes his eyes down my body, and I swear I can feel his stare
penetrating me between my legs just like his tongue did a few weeks back.
We haven't had a repeat of that night, but I want one—badly. Especially
after the many make-out sessions we've had since then. He always seems to
pull back at the last minute when it's starting to get good, but tonight, I
want more.
Tonight, I want him.
“Hi,” I whisper.
“Hey,” he says, that grin of his growing.
I have no idea how long we stand there staring at one another, just like I
have no idea who it is that makes the first move. All I know is one second
Lowell is standing outside my door grinning at me, and the next he has me
pressed against the wall with his mouth fused to mine.
“God, I missed your mouth,” he says against me.
I missed you.
But I don't say that.
Instead, I say, “I missed yours more.”
Then he kisses me on said lips. He kisses me until I'm almost positive
they'll be bruised tomorrow. Until I'm literally writhing against him,
needing relief. Until I am so fucking turned on I'm going to explode if
something else doesn't happen soon.
“Lowell…”
He chuckles darkly, like he knows what he's been doing to me all along.
He goes to pull away, pumping the brakes like he has been doing, and I
can't this time.
I need a release.
I clutch the lapels on his suit, not letting him run, and look straight into
his deep green eyes, loving the way they darken as he begins to understand
what I'm silently asking for.
Begging for.
He gulps once. Twice.
“Are you sure?” he asks quietly.
He's not asking me if I'm sure I want to have sex. We both know the
answer to that. He's asking if I'm sure I understand what we're about to do
really means.
Sex.
Just sex.
I know that, and he knows that too. He can't offer more, and I'm not
even sure if I'm ready for more.
But this right now? This I am definitely ready for.
Just sex.
I want just sex.
“Yes.”
His eyes flicker with just that simple word, then he's ravaging my
mouth again.
We kiss for what feels like hours before he wrenches his mouth from
mine, down my chin, and over my throat. He kisses me there, nipping and
sucking, leaving behind spots that will surely be visible tomorrow, but right
now I don't care. Not when his hand is sliding along my side, his fingers
brushing the waistband of my shorts but never slipping beneath the tiny bit
of fabric. Over and over, torturing me slowly. Deliciously.
I love and hate it, and I want more yet I want him to stop.
When he finally dips his fingers into my shorts, I sigh with the relief of
what's to come.
Lowell slowly moves his fingers lower and lower until just the pad of
his finger brushes over my clit. I hiss at the contact, and he laughs again
like an asshole, clearly enjoying my discomfort.
He doesn't move his hand for a long time. He just holds the pad of his
finger there, alternating between kissing paths up my neck and sucking on
my lips.
Then finally—fucking finally—he dips a single finger into me, and my
knees nearly buckle.
“Fuck, you're wet.”
“Because you're torturing me!”
He chuckles again. “You like it.”
“I do,” I pant, bearing down on his finger that's gliding in and out of
me, loving the way his palm is brushing against my clit. “So much. But you
know what else I'd like?”
“Hmm?”
“To be fucked.”
He pauses for only a moment, then says, “I think I can manage that.”
I cry out when he withdraws his finger from me, and then yet again
when he lifts the glistening digit to his mouth and licks it.
“Shit,” he groans. “I almost forgot how good you taste.”
“You…like doing that?”
“Like it? Are you kidding me?” He laughs mockingly, one side of his
lips turning up in a smirk. “I'd spend an entire twenty-four hours with my
face buried in your pussy if I could.”
I tremble at the thought, loving the idea of it, especially given the last
time he was between my legs, I thought I was going to stop breathing at one
point.
He doesn't miss the shiver.
“Is that what you want?” He cups me through my shorts. “For me to eat
your pretty pussy?”
“Y-Yes. No. Yes.”
He laughs. “Well, which one is it, darlin'?”
“What I mean is yes, but not now. Right now, I want…” I gasp as his
thumb presses into me through my shorts, circling my clit with a force
that's just delightful enough. “I want…”
“To be fucked, was it?”
I gulp, nodding.
He steps away—like completely away.
I reach for him, but he shakes his head just once. He kicks his shoes off,
then, slowly, he shoves his suit jacket off his shoulders and tosses it aside.
His hands drop to his belt, and I practically salivate watching him unhook
it. He doesn't take his pants off though. He doesn't pull his cock out, and
somehow, it's hotter than if he were actually naked.
His deft fingers make quick work of undoing the buttons on his dress
shirt. He strips that off and throws it somewhere too.
He's gorgeous. There's no other word to describe it.
He reaches out, one finger under my chin, and tips it up.
“Don't move,” he instructs, and I nod.
Then he's gone. Across-the-room gone.
He sits on the couch, spreading his legs wide, and just watches me. His
eyes rake up and down my body, then he does it all over again. Just.
Watching.
It's unnerving and exhilarating all at once. I've never been touched like
this before, and he's not even physically touching me. He's just looking,
and somehow, it's so much more.
“Strip.” His voice is low and commanding, and it makes me eager to
follow his directions.
I grab the hem of the thin t-shirt I have on and slowly tug it over my
head. I'm not wearing a bra, and it feels so strange standing before Lowell
with just a pair of shorts on.
When I don't make a move to push them off, he lifts a brow, waiting.
I want to make him wait.
I want to make him squirm and yearn for me like I am for him. So I take
my messy hair and wrap it into a ponytail, loving the way the strands brush
lightly across my shoulder blades. Loving the way his eyes track every
single movement. Loving the way the humor dances in his eyes when he
realizes what I'm doing.
Finally, when I'm good and ready, I drag the shorts down my legs,
stepping out of them and tossing them to the side.
His eyes widen, then darken, and he inhales a sharp breath at the sight
of me. He slides his pants down his legs, his cock finally springing free, and
oh god is it as beautiful as I remember.
He strokes it once, twice, reaching down to cup his balls and pull on
them. My nipples pebble to stiff peaks just watching him, and I bet if I were
to slip my hand between my legs right now, I'd be drenched.
Only then do I realize I never had any power in this moment at all. It
was all him.
It was always him.
“Come.”
Slowly, I saunter across the room, enjoying watching him play with
himself.
I stop at his knees. “Now what?”
“Now, you use me.”
Use me.
He said that before, and just like then, it does something to me. I know
it's him relinquishing control because he wants me to feel comfortable. I
love that he's putting my comfort first. I think it's hotter than anything else
that's happened tonight.
He reaches a single finger out, sliding it through my pussy for a
moment, only to bring it back to his mouth for a taste.
I lied. That's the hottest thing he's done tonight, and it has me falling
into his lap—literally. I straddle him, twining my arms around his neck and
rubbing myself against him. He looks down, watching where we're
connected.
“Fuck,” he mutters. “You're perfect.”
“I haven't even done anything yet.”
His hands find my ass, kneading my cheeks.
“And if you don't soon, I may revoke the whole being a gentleman
thing I'm doing.”
I roll my bottom lip between my teeth. “I'm sorry, Lowell, am I teasing
you too much?”
I rub against him again.
“Is this taking things too slow for you?”
Another rub.
“Is this—”
I don't finish the sentence.
I don't finish the sentence because suddenly I'm lifted and Lowell's
cock is pushing into me.
We both let out a low groan as he slides in, inch by delicious inch.
I've missed this. It's the first thing that runs through my mind, which is
ridiculous because I've only had this one other time.
I lean forward, resting my forehead against his, trying to get used to his
size again.
“You feel…” He gulps. “Fuck.”
“Good fuck?”
“Great fuck.”
He crashes his mouth to mine, kissing me slowly as he lets me take the
lead, allowing me to slowly work myself on him. He doesn't rush me; he
lets me have complete control.
My orgasm is building higher and higher and it's within reach, I just
need…
“Lowell…”
His fingers that have been playing lightly in the ends of my ponytail are
the only indication of what's to come. Suddenly, he wraps my hair around
his fist and yanks my head back just hard enough for it to cause a bite of
pain, but not enough for it to be malicious.
I cry out as his other hand comes up to rest at the base of my throat,
where he applies just the tiniest hint of pressure as he fucks up into me.
Over and over again. Faster. Harder. So damn needy I think I may actually
fall apart.
And then I do.
My orgasm hits me out of nowhere, a blinding white light behind my
eyes and a tingle from head to toe. There was no warning. No usual
crescendo. It just shattered the earth around me with no preamble.
My pussy clenches around Lowell's cock and he's riding the same wave
I am just moments later, spilling himself inside of me. Almost instantly I
collapse onto him, and he catches me with ease, like he knew it would
happen all along. He wraps his arms around me as I rest my head on his
shoulder, trying to catch my breath.
I have no idea how long we sit like that—Lowell holding me and
drawing small circles on my back, me resting against him.
But however long it is, I know it's not enough.
Which isn't a good thing because this has to be enough.
With as much energy as I can muster, I push away, finally looking at the
man who just made my world implode. His curious green eyes are watching
me, searching to make sure I'm okay with what just happened.
I'm okay with it.
I am more than okay with it. Too okay with it.
“Well, the good news is, I definitely didn't get you pregnant this time.”
A laugh bursts out of me because it's what I didn't know I needed right
now.
But Lowell knew.
Lowell always knows.
And that's what scares me the most.

LOWELL
I tried to resist her.
Heaven help me, I tried.
But it was impossible with her looking up at me with those sapphire
blue eyes full of desire and need. So, I caved, and if it meant waking up
with her curled around me like she currently is, I'd do it all over again.
Hell, I'd do it all over again even if she weren't. Last night was
incredible. The kind of incredible that rocks you to your core and scares you
because you're certain absolutely nothing will ever be that good again.
It can't be. It's impossible.
She wiggles against me, and I can tell by the change in her breathing
that she's beginning to wake up, which means I should probably stop
staring at her like a total creep.
“Mmm.” She snuggles deeper into me. “You're warm.”
“It's a blessing and a curse.”
“I'm always cold.”
“I've noticed.”
She presses a soft kiss to my side, and I can feel her grin against me. It's
the same dopey grin I'm wearing.
“Good morning,” she mutters.
“Good morning. Sleep well?”
“Mmm,” she says again, this time stretching her body out. “So good.”
“Are you sore?”
“A little.” She blushes. “But I like it.”
I like that she likes it.
She pushes up on her elbow and looks down at me. “Can I try
something?”
“Of course.”
She leans down and presses her lips to mine. It's a quick kiss before
she's pulling away, but I grab her, holding her hostage before she can get
too far.
“We've tried that before,” I say to her.
She laughs. “We have, but you'll thank me later.”
She kisses me again, but this time, she doesn't pull away—she heads
south.
And keeps going and going.
She pauses when she reaches my stomach.
“Is that… Is that lint in your belly button?” She digs the piece of fuzz
out, tossing it onto the floor.
“Hey! Put that back! It was keeping me warm.”
“You're ridiculous.” She smothers a laugh against my stomach,
continuing her path.
She looks and feels fucking amazing, sliding over me, pressing kisses
down my stomach. Her pussy slides against my cock as she continues her
languid assault, and I'm only mildly embarrassed by the sound that leaves
my throat.
She laughs, then places kisses all over my thighs, dutifully ignoring my
cock that's likely harder than it's ever been in my life. I would do anything
in this moment to feel her pretty lips wrapped around it.
She kisses my right thigh, then my left. Back to my right, but this time
she's just slightly closer to my balls. She keeps going until I'm pretty sure
I'm going to nut without her ever touching my dick.
Then, in one slow, long lick, she traces her tongue from my balls all the
way to the tip of my cock and finally covers it with her mouth.
As embarrassing as it is, I almost come.
“Fuuuuuuuck.” My hips rise involuntarily.
She giggles around me, and I swear to fuck I feel it in my toes too. She
sucks me, rolling her tongue around the head, using one hand to fist my
length and the other to lightly scrape her nails along the sensitive inside of
my thigh.
I'm going to die.
I am going to die, and this is going to be the most epic death ever.
I don't even notice I've driven my hips upward until she gags, and I
immediately feel bad, backing off.
“Shit. Fuck. I'm so sorry. I—”
She shoves me back down, continuing to work me over, and it's not
long until I build right back up to where I just was—about to make a mess.
“I'm going to come, Hollis, so unless you want me—”
“Use me,” she murmurs, repeating my words back to me.
She wraps her tits around my hard cock and opens her mouth. She
wants me to fuck her tits.
Oh god.
So, I do.
I fuck her tits, loving the way the tip of my cock brushes against her
tongue. Everything is just enough to make me explode.
“Incom—”
It's all I can manage before I coat her lips and throat and her chin with
my cum, and I'd be lying if I said the sight of her covered in me wasn't
enough to make me ready for another round right away.
Because it is. I'm not exactly sure why it is, but it's hot and it's doing
something to me.
She pushes up to her knees, looking up at me with a proud smirk.
“You good?”
I laugh, throwing myself back on the bed as she crawls back up to the
pillows. “I can't believe I just fucked your tits. That's like shit you do when
you're eighteen and your girlfriend is on her period, but you want to screw
and she says no to anal, so you go to town between her tits.”
“That sounds…oddly specific.” Hollis lifts an amused brow.
I shrug. “Just some story I heard from some guy.”
“Uh-huh.” She laughs. “Sorry we didn't… I'm just tired.”
My brows crush together. “Hollis, you don't need to apologize, and you
also don't need to titty-fuck me because you feel too tired for sex.”
“Well, I wanted to. So there.”
“Is that your way of saying no to anal?”
She sputters out a laugh. “Yes. Yes, it is.”
“Yet…right?”
She shakes her head with a grin, rolling away from me. “Don't you have
practice this morning?”
Oh fuck.
I scramble to check the time, but it's still early. Like way-too-early-tobe-up kind of early.
But I have an idea.
“Come on,” I tell her. “I want to take you somewhere.”
“Is it to the shower? Because…” She looks down at the mess drying on
her.
“Yes. And then to donuts.”
“Donuts?” She dashes off the bed faster than I've seen her move in
weeks and runs to the bathroom. “I'm showering first!” she calls out, and I
laugh.
We are definitely not taking turns.
“This is the place you've been getting donuts from?”
“Yep. Why?”
“I don't know. I guess I just wasn't expecting an adorable food truck. I
thought it would be a little mom-and-pop shop or something.”
“Nah. Just Scout.”
She lifts a brow. “Scout? You're on a first-name basis with the donut
maker?”
“You jealous?”
“No,” she says quickly…too quickly.
I try not to think too much about how much I like the idea of Hollis
being jealous of another woman over me. Not that she has a reason to be,
but still.
“Right. Sure.” I wink. “Stay there.”
I round the truck and pull her door open, helping her down.
“You don't have to do that, you know. I am perfectly capable of exiting
a vehicle by myself. I'm pregnant, but not that pregnant.”
“Are you seriously complaining about me being a gentleman right
now?”
“I—well, no. Kind of.” Her cheeks darken as we make our way up the
path to the food truck turned donut shop.
“I was raised with manners, Hollis, and pregnant or not, I'll still help
you out of the truck. Because that's what gentlemen do.”
She presses up on her tiptoes to whisper, “Do gentlemen also do what
you did to me this morning?”
Don't get a boner.
Don't get a boner.
Do. Not. Get. A. Boner.
“Behave,” I mutter, both to her and myself because I know I really don't
want to behave right now.
We get into the back of the line. It's short today. Usually, this place is
about ten people deep every time I come here. I have no idea how Scout
keeps up with everything, but she always does.
“So, how'd you find out about this place?” Hollis asks, taking in the
little setup.
“Well…I grew up about two hours from here, and Scout went to high
school with me. She's two years younger and was in the same grade as my
sister. Word got out back home that she owned this place, so I made it my
mission to come by and support it as much as I can. I might also make sure
to cause a scene when I'm here and get my picture taken as much as
possible in hopes it makes it on social media and gets her some of the
recognition she deserves.”
What I don't tell her is that Scout was bullied a lot for being shy and for
having gay dads, and I couldn't stand the thought of her putting her all into
this business and having it fail, not after everything she's gone through.
Hollis tips her head to the side, studying me. She doesn't stop, not even
when I shift uncomfortably under her gaze.
“What?” I ask.
“Nothing. It's just… You're a good guy, Lowell.”
“Are you surprised by this?”
She takes a moment to answer, and that's how I know it's honest and
not a reflex. “No.”
That makes my heart swell with pride.
“Mr. Lowell!”
A little voice pulls my attention from Hollis, and I look over to find the
eight-year-old who believes we're the best friends in the world charging at
me, a sketchbook and pencil in her hand as usual.
To be fair, she's right—we are the best friends in the world.
“What'd I tell you about calling me Mr. Lowell?” I ask as she skids to a
stop in front of me.
“That it makes you sound like your dad and you ain't no old man.”
“That's right.” I hold my fist out, and she bumps it. “What are you
doing here today, Miss Macie? No school today?”
“Nope. I have the day off because the teachers gotta talk to the mommas
and pappas.”
“Are they talking to your momma and pappa?”
She shakes her head adamantly. “No! I've been good!”
“No more kicking?”
She puts her hand on her hip. “Only when the boys need it.”
I tuck my lips together, trying not to laugh. “That's fair.”
“Who's this?” She points to Hollis. “This your girlfriend?” The word
girlfriend comes out with the slightest hint of disdain, and neither I nor
Hollis miss it.
“I'm Lowell's…friend,” Hollis tells her, sticking her hand out to shake
it.
Macie looks at it, then back at Hollis. “I'm Lowell's best friend.”
“Oh, so you're the one he's been telling me all about, huh?”
I grin because I know she's just trying to make Macie feel important.
I've never mentioned her to Hollis before at all.
Macie's little eyes widen. “He talks about me?”
Hollis nods. “All the time. He was telling me what a good artist you are
too.”
“I am a good artist. You want to see?”
“I would love to.” Hollis turns back to me. “Grab us girls some donuts,
will ya?”
She winks, then lets Macie drag her away to a table nearby. I watch as
they go, stepping up to the front of the food truck to order.
Scout being Scout, she already has my usual ready to go.
“Can I get a chocolate milk and a Boston cream too?”
I catch her grin from the corner of my eye, then finally look over at her.
She's watching me with a look I can't quite decipher, and I don't know
how I feel about that. I've known Scout from a distance for a long time
now, and we've even been friendly over the last few years. I don't like that I
can't quite read this expression when I usually always can.
“What?”
She shakes her head, raising her hands. “Nothing.”
“Bullshit. That's a something look.”
“What's that you're doing with her, Lowell?”
“With who?”
Scout nods toward the table where Macie and Hollis have their heads
bent together, discussing whatever it is they're drawing. They look so cute,
and with Macie's dark hair, they almost look like they could be mother and
daughter.
That's going to be mine someday.
The thought hits me all at once, and I'm taken aback by it.
I know logically, this will be mine someday. But not mine mine.
And the thought that I want it to be terrifies me.
I slide my card toward Scout. “It's nothing.”
Her brows rise, the corners of her mouth tipping up. “Then my look was
nothing too.”
We're both full of shit, and we both know it.

HOLLIS
“I'd like to keep an eye on your morning sickness, but everything is looking
good. Your fundal height is about twenty centimeters.”
“Her fungal is what?”
“Fundal,” I correct Lowell, trying not to laugh because he looks
incredibly concerned. “She means the distance from my pubic bone to my
uterus.”
“Twenty centimeters…that's like seven and a half inches or so, right?”
“A little over, yes.”
He nods. “And that's good?”
“Yes. It's measuring in range. Now, would you like to find out if you're
having a boy or a girl today?”
“No.”
“Yes.”
We answer the doctor at the same time, and she laughs at our difference
of opinion.
“Seems we have a split.”
If there's anything we've discussed the most during this pregnancy, it's
wanting to know or keeping it a surprise. I am team surprise while Lowell is
dying to know, though I think that's mostly because he wants to prove me
right if the baby is a girl.
I always thought I'd want to know too, but as the weeks go by, I realize
it truly doesn't matter to me what we have. All I want is to be able to look
into that baby's eyes and say, “I love you.” The rest doesn't matter, and it
will never matter.
“Is that normal?” Lowell asks from the chair beside me.
He's sitting forward, elbows resting on his knees, observing everything
happening. It's the same stare I've seen from him when he's watching
anything hockey related—serious and studious.
Even with the season in full swing, he's been so attentive and present.
Hell, he showed up for this appointment today still wet from his shower
after morning skate, and then when this is over, he'll go back to the rink for
a game tonight.
It shouldn't surprise me, but it does. Something tells me if I were having
this baby with anyone else, they wouldn't be this invested, and that makes
me feel ways I know I shouldn't be feeling.
“It's pretty common,” the doctor says reassuringly. “Plenty of parents
are opposite on the decision to know or not. How about I put it in an
envelope and whoever wants to know can look? Sound good?”
“That's perfect,” I answer, then look at Lowell. “You happy?”
“Yes. I can't wait to see that I'm right.”
The doctor laughs and continues with the exam. When we're finished,
she tells us everything looks perfect and she'll see us for our next
appointment, then sends us out front to set it up.
“My penis.”
“What?!” I squeak out, eyes widening, glancing at the receptionist who
either isn't paying us any attention or is really good at acting. I gulp,
looking back at the man I just might murder today. “W-What about it?”
“Your fundal height is the size of my penis. Seven and a half inches.”
I don't have to look in a mirror to know my cheeks are on fire right
now. “Cameron!”
“What? It is.”
“That's…nice.” I peek back over at the receptionist, who, based on how
red her cheeks are, is now listening very intently to our conversation. I
lower my voice. “You couldn't have found literally anything else to
compare that measurement to? Literally anything else that's seven inches?”
“Seven and a half.” He shrugs. “I'm sure I could have, but I'm most
familiar with this one.”
“That's… Okay, all right.”
I shake my head, promising with my eyes to make good on that
homicide threat. I turn back to the receptionist, who looks like she wants to
both laugh and climb on top of Lowell to see if he's lying or not.
“Our appointment,” I snap, and even I'm surprised by how bitchy I
sound.
“Oh! Of course!” She scrambles around to get us scheduled for our next
visit and gives us a card with all the information.
Lowell sets his hand on my lower back as we leave.
“I liked that,” he says quietly.
“Hmm?”
“Your jealousy.”
“I wasn't jealous,” I lie. “I was just…ready to leave.”
He lifts his brows and tucks his lips together, clearly not believing me as
he steers me toward the truck—because yes, he is still driving the clunker
around—and opens the door for me. He helps me climb inside, and by the
time I sit down, I'm winded, because that's just my life now.
I sigh, leaning back against the seat.
“You doing okay?” he asks, going from laughter to concern as he
searches my eyes for an answer.
“Yeah, just…tired.”
He's always doing that, always staring and looking at me, like really
looking at me. Sometimes it's unnerving, and sometimes I like it entirely
too much.
I'm starting to realize I like a lot of things about him entirely too much.
I like how patient he is and how supportive he is. How funny and smart
and kind he is too. I like the way he looks at me from across the room, and I
like the way he touches me like he's not able to not touch me. I like the way
I feel when I'm with him—protected and cared for.
And I really like the way he loves our baby.
He crowds against me, sliding his hands up my thighs to my protruding
belly.
I can't stand anyone else touching it. I've had some people try in the
grocery store—creepy much?—and it's uncomfortable even during the
exams. Hell, not even Harper has touched it.
But when it's Lowell's hands on me, it's calming, and I almost crave the
calm.
“You sure that's it?”
“I'm sure.”
He nods, then dips his head, putting his lips near my belly. “Excuse me,
little miss, but you're wearing your mom out and that's my job, okay?”
He places a gentle kiss to my belly, and now I'm no longer tired—I'm
turned on. There's something about seeing him talk to our baby that drives
me wild, and he's been doing it more often lately, which means I've been
ripping his clothes off more.
We've not really talked about us sleeping together, but we're not not
talking about it either. It's just sort of…happening.
I want to ask him what it means—if anything—but I don't want to ruin
whatever it is we have going on either. I just want to enjoy it and get
through these last few months of my pregnancy.
“Are you quite finished?” I tug him back up. “You know it gets me
going when you go all daddy on me.” I let out a squeak. “Not like daddy
daddy. But daddy, the non-kinky kind of daddy.”
His eyes dance with laughter. “Duly noted.”
“Shut up,” I grumble, totally embarrassed. “Are you going to open that
envelope or not?”
He dips his hand into his back pocket and pulls out the envelope
containing the anatomy scan of our baby.
He wiggles it my way. “Are you sure you don't want to know?”
“I'm positive. Don't tell me. Don't give any indication if you're right—
which you're not—or if I'm right—which I am. But you can look.”
He slips his finger into the envelope and peels it open, pulling out the
scan just enough to see the results.
And then nothing happens.
There is not a single twitch on his face when he sees it. I watch more
closely than I've ever watched anything before, but he gives nothing away.
He simply slips the scan back in the envelope and places it back in his
pocket.
All that curiosity I've been pushing away for months comes barreling
into me, and I want to reach in there and rip open the scan and see it for
myself right this moment.
He laughs. “You totally want to know now, don't you?”
I growl at him. “Again, shut up.”
Another laugh.
I groan. “Don't you have a hockey game to play or something?”
“No, darlin', I have a hockey game to win.”
“Please tell me that glow you have going on is not just pregnancy but
because somebody got dicked down by the hot-as-hell hockey player who
knocked her up.”
Sparkling water sprays out of my mouth at her words. “Jesus, Emilia.” I
run the back of my hand across my lips to clean them up. “Ryan said that
before. Who says dicked down? What does that even mean?”
“You know when he lays you down, then bangs you so good you can't
walk straight for at least two days? That's getting dicked down.”
I sputter out a laugh. “Oh my god, what is wrong with you?”
She shrugs, brushing her long red hair out of the way. “I'm horny and
it's been forever since I have personally been dicked down myself. I'm sure
working with all these hot players isn't helping at all. It's starting to get to
me.”
“I'm sorry.” And I am sorry. I know what it's like to be around Lowell
all day long and not get dicked down, so I understand.
“It's fine. It's my own fault.” She waves me off. “Anyway, you didn't
answer my question. Is that a sex glow and not a baby glow?” She takes a
sip of her wine, eyeing me expectantly.
I go for a noncommittal shrug, but I've known Emilia since the first
grade, and she knows exactly what all my shrugs mean.
“Ha!” She points at me. “You totally got laid, didn't you?”
I roll my lips together, nodding. “I did. I got laid a lot. Like a lot a lot.”
“Wait—has this been going on a while?” She pulls a frown when I nod.
“I feel so bad that I haven't been around, but it's—”
I wave my hand. “It's the middle of hockey season. I understand, and
it's not a big deal. I know you're busy corralling grown-ass men who love
to throw themselves around on the ice. You have a life and a job. I get it.
Me, I'm just kind of here, waiting to have this baby and looking for a bigger
apartment and hoping I can bust my ass over the next few months so I can
afford said bigger apartment when the baby comes.”
I found a place that's almost directly in between Lowell's and the arena.
It's decently within my budget with a little tweaking, but I know I'm going
to have to put in double the time I usually do over the next couple of
months to be able to save up money for any kind of maternity leave.
I also know it's going to be a lot of extra hard work for me when the
baby comes because Lowell is about to be in the most important part of his
season.
She tips her head. “What do you mean? Why aren't you just moving in
with Lowell?”
“Why would I move in with him?”
“Uh, because he got you pregnant!”
“Yes, I am aware of that fact.”
“And you're sleeping together!”
“Again, yes, aware of that.”
“You're telling me you're sleeping together, you're pregnant with his
baby, and you're not going to move in with him?”
“Yeah, pretty much.”
She doesn't say anything for several long moments. She just watches
me, and it's unnerving because when Emilia just watches, it means
whatever she says next is something I know I am not going to like.
“You're insane,” she whispers. “This baby has sucked all of your brain
cells out of you and you have gone utterly insane.”
To an extent, she's not wrong. But that's not what this is about. “I don't
see what the big deal is.”
“You don't see what the big deal is…” She mutters my words back to
herself, then scoffs. “Come on. You're smarter than that, Hollis. I know you
are.”
I am. But I'm also dumb enough to keep doing it.
I wave her words off. “It's fine. I'm fine. We're fine.”
“Are you?”
“Yes!”
It comes out louder than intended, but I'm getting frustrated by her line
of questioning. I'm a grown adult. I know what I'm doing.
“Sorry,” I say. “It's just… We are both very aware of what this is. It's
the same score as last time. It's nothing serious.”
She looks pointedly at his shoes that are sitting by the door.
“I admit that does look a little serious, but that's not what this is. We are
just two people enjoying the company of one another while we wait on our
baby to come into this world. I don't have any preconceived notions about
what is happening between us, and I know Lowell also does not have any
preconceived notions about what's happening between us. In case you
forgot, I haven't even been divorced for a full year. I am not looking to rush
into anything serious.” I run my hand over my belly. “Well, besides my
baby, of course. But it's not like I can just return that one. I didn't keep the
receipt.”
She laughs lightly, but the joy slips from her penetrating gaze all too
soon. “Can I say something?”
“Knowing you, you will anyway.” I motion for her to continue.
“I spend a decent amount of time around the team. Yeah, I don't travel
with them often, but I'm here at home with them when they're at the rink,
which we both know is a lot of hours a day during the season. So, it's safe
to say I know these guys fairly well, which means I feel like I can say this
with confidence: I have never seen Lowell the way he is now.”
“What do you mean the way he is now?”
“I mean…lighter. Happy.” She takes a sip of her wine. “Don't get me
wrong—he's always been really nice and friendly and he's just an allaround really good guy. But he's also always been private and a little
guarded, especially when it comes to letting anybody get close to anything
about his personal life. That said, I can't tell you the number of times I have
witnessed that man pass around a photo of your sonogram with nothing but
pride on his face, just like I can't tell you the number of times I have seen
his face light up talking about not just your baby, but you. I say that as a
person who has seen this without even knowing you two were sleeping
together, which means I'm coming from the standpoint of pure honesty
when I say he has feelings for you.”
I sigh. “Of course he probably has some feelings for me—I'm carrying
his baby.”
“True, but…” She lifts her shoulder. “I don't know, Hollis. It's different.
He's different. Even if neither one of you are ready to admit it, he has
feelings feelings for you, and unless you somehow end up admitting them,
neither one of you are walking away from this unscathed in the end.”
“End? There is no end, Emilia. I'm the mother of his child.”
She lifts her wine to her lips and raises her brow. “I know, and that's the
bitch of it all.”

LOWELL
I could stand here and watch this all day.
That's what flits through my mind as I lean against the wall just inside
Hollis' apartment, watching her shake her ass from across the room. I
remember the first time I watched her dance, and I remember thinking she
was godawful at it then.
She still is. And yet, I still love watching her.
“Radio Ga Ga” by Queen is blasting out of a smart device on the
counter, and she has no idea I'm even standing here. She's using a wooden
spoon as a microphone and singing horribly off-key.
It's adorable. She's adorable.
I don't alert her to my presence until the song fades out.
“Very nice! Encore!” I clap my hands.
Apparently, it's the wrong thing to do.
“SON OF A…!” She whirls around, hand to her chest. “Lowell! I just
pissed myself, you ass!”
She takes off running for the bathroom and slams the door, all while
muttering to herself.
I won't lie, I feel bad.
But only a little.
I help myself into the apartment and flop down on her couch. It's not
long before she's marching back out of the bathroom with a scowl firmly on
her face, still muttering.
Her scowl deepens the moment she spots me. “What the hell are you
still doing here?”
“Uh, it's game day.”
“And?”
“And I always come here on game day.”
“Well, I don't want you here. Leave.” She points to the door.
“Whoa, whoa, whoa,” I say, popping up off the couch. “I can't just
leave. I always come here on game day.”
She rolls her eyes. “Freaking hockey players and their stupid
superstitions.” She crosses her arms over her chest. “Fine. You can stay, but
I am not sleeping with you—not after you just made me piss myself. You
can't just walk up and scare pregnant women, Lowell.”
“Don't hate on our superstitions, okay? They're a real thing, and there's
like lots of science to prove it. Second, I didn't mean to scare you. You left
your apartment unlocked, something we should probably really talk about
because that is extremely dangerous. I could have been anybody.” She
opens her mouth to argue, but I keep going anyway. “And third, do you
think I just come here for sex?”
“W-Well… Well…” She throws her arms up. “Yes! Isn't that why you
come here?”
My mouth falls open in surprise. “Um, no. When have I ever come over
here and thrown myself at you or begged for sex? You're the pregnant and
horny one, remember?”
“Oh, so you don't want to have sex with me? You're just obliging my
request because I'm some sex-crazed maniac, huh?”
“Well, you have the maniac part right.”
“Lowell…” she growls.
“Hollis…” I growl back.
She literally huffs and puffs, and I can't help but laugh. She tosses her
arms up, trying to walk away from me, but I don't let her. Instead, I pull her
into my embrace, wrapping my arms around her.
“Stop, stop, stop,” I say, trapping her as I sigh. “I need you to listen to
me and listen to me closely here, all right? I am not just here for sex. Do I
like it? Yes. Nothing pleases me more than to walk out of this apartment
with the smell of you still on my face and fingers.” Her eyes darken at my
words. “But that's not why I come here. I come here because you're
carrying my child and I like spending time with them and you. Okay? So
don't minimize my coming over here as being just for sex. Though again, I
do really love that part.”
Like really, really love that part. I probably love that part way more than
I'm supposed to. We've been sleeping together for a while now, and I
almost can't remember a time when we weren't sleeping together.
I get it. It's a release for her, and I'm happy to help her out, but I have
no idea what that's going to mean for us down the road.
I don't want to think about that or any heavy bullshit right now. It's
game day, and I don't come to her apartment on game day to get all up
inside my head. I come here to relax.
Also, almost every time I've come here, we've won, but I'm not going
to tell her that.
She sighs, then loops her arms around my neck, her fingers going into
the edges of my hair, tugging lightly at the strands. “Okay, fine. You can
stay.”
“I can?”
She nods. “Yes. But, Lowell?”
“Hmm?”
“I changed my mind. I'd really like to have sex now.”
“Do it again, but slower.”
“Slower?”
“Yeah.” She licks her lips as I follow her instructions. “Oh god. Yeah,
just like that.”
“You like that?”
“I do. I like that a lot.”
“You want more?”
She traps her lip between her teeth, watching me intently. “Slower.”
“I can't go any slower. My jaw is getting cramped already.” I wiggle it
back and forth, then set my knife down, sitting back in my chair, patting my
full stomach. “Plus, I'm stuffed.”
“It was one steak!”
“It was one steak two steaks ago, Hollis. I am full.”
We've been sitting here for the last two hours eating dinner, and since
Hollis is not allowed to have rare meat, she's been forcing me to eat the
steaks for her.
And by forcing, I mean I definitely wanted to.
“Wimp.”
To be fair, the steaks are fairly small, and if I hadn't eaten an entire
basket of bread before they arrived, I probably could have finished this one
too. What I don't tell Hollis is that I'm trying not to make myself too full
because I have a feeling with the way she's been rubbing her thighs together
all night, this evening is going to end with both of us naked in her bed.
“Excuse me, waiter, do you think I could get about, oh, twelve ounces
of this ranch to go, please?”
Hollis immediately smacks her hand over her mouth, breathing in and
out deeply through her nose. I know right away it was just the mention of
ranch. I tried to put some on my salad last week and she ran to the bathroom
faster than I've ever seen her run—and that includes when I accidentally
made her pee her pants…for the second time.
The couple at the table who just asked for the ranch notices.
“Zachary!” the woman seethes. “Stop it!”
“What? This place has really good ranch, and we live like an hour away.
There's no way I'm leaving here without some to go.”
“Uh, let me go check with my manager.” The waiter scurries off,
looking as concerned as I am because this guy just ordered an entire small
bottle of ranch to go.
The woman jerks her head toward our table. “You just made that woman
sick with your disgusting ranch habit.”
He gasps. “How dare you! Ranch is not disgusting—you think my ranch
habit is cute!”
“Stop saying it!” She glances at Hollis, who is starting to look a little
green. “I'm pretty sure she's about a second away from blowing.”
Hollis shakes her head up and down, eyes wide, and I laugh, which
earns me a glare.
The woman leans over. “I am so sorry about him. Sometimes he leaves
his manners at home.” She glances down at Hollis' round belly. “Oh, you're
pregnant! That actually explains so much. You know when my best friend,
Zoe, was pregnant, she was the exact same way. Even the mere mention
of”—she glances at her husband—“well, the stuff that shall not be named
and she was ready to just lose it.”
Hollis takes another couple of deep breaths and removes her hand from
her mouth. She musters up a small smile. “It's fine. I'm the one who is
sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt your meal with my problem.”
The woman waves her off. “It's no big deal at all.” She turns her eyes
on me, squinting. “You look really familiar.”
“Delia!” her husband admonishes.
“What?” she asks. “Doesn't he look familiar?”
The guy puts his head in his hands. “That's because you watch him all
the time. He's the captain for the Carolina Comets, who we're season ticket
holders for!”
“Oh!” For a moment she looks embarrassed, then she waves her hand
with a shrug. “You know I just go for the snacks and hockey butts. I
couldn't tell a first trick from a downtouch or whatever they're called.” She
sticks her hand out. “Hi, I'm Delia. This is my husband, Zach.”
“Hollis.” She introduces herself, shaking the woman's hand, then points
to me. “And Cam—well, you know him as Lowell.”
Zach clears his throat. “Despite my wife not knowing you, I'm a huge
fan. I know it's a small world, but you might be a little familiar with my
brother. He's an agent for a couple guys on your team. Shep Clark?”
“Ah, yeah. I've met Shep a few times. He reps Rhodes and Wright.”
Honestly, the dude is a gifted agent and got both of them some pretty sweet
deals recently. “Definitely a small world. You said you live an hour away,
yeah?”
“Yeah, depending on traffic.”
“Have you ever been out to the brewery in Caseyville?”
“We haven't. Driven by lots of times on our way out to Slice.” Zach
pats his stomach. “That pizza there is killer.”
“So good. Awful for my waistline in the off-season though. I actually
co-own the brewery with my sister.”
“No shit? Well, we're definitely stopping in now.”
“You should meet up there with Sully and Porter the next time you guys
get together to talk apps and security or whatnot,” Delia says.
“Apps?”
“Yep,” Zach answers. “My company builds them.”
“Yeah? My sister mentioned something about wanting to maybe get an
app for the brewery. We should get together sometime and talk about that.”
Zach's eyes widen. “Dude. I would love that. And I won't even ask you
to sign my jersey at the meeting.”
“You'll just wait until after, right?” Delia asks.
“Obviously.”
I laugh. “Deal.”
“I hate to cut this short,” his wife says, looking at her phone, “but we
should head out. Don't want to miss putting the kids to bed.”
“You two have kids?” Hollis asks, perking up. “How many?”
She's been doing that often lately. Anytime there's a baby or children
around, she pays closer attention to them like she's trying to glean some
insight into mothering.
“Eight.”
My eyes nearly pop out of my head. “Eight?”
She laughs. “Sorry, I should have clarified—our kids are goats.”
“Pygmy goats to be exact,” Zach says, pulling his phone out. “Here,
look.”
“Are those Harry Potter sweaters?”
“Kick-ass, right?”
“Fantastic. The Comets jersey is a nice touch too, but I'm probably a
little biased.”
Zach laughs, then adds my number to his phone and pockets it. “We'll
let you get back to your meal and talk later about the app for the brewery.”
“Sounds good.”
We shake hands just as the waiter comes back out with a tub of ranch
for him. I've never seen someone's face light up so bright before. He
cradles it to his chest, and I swear I hear him call it his precious.
“Maybe we'll see you at a game?” Delia says as she stands.
Zach slips her jacket around her. “Yeah, you can teach this one that
there are no touchdowns in hockey.”
Hollis laughs. “Don't worry, I am all up to date on the lingo. We'll make
you a pro in no time.”
She was resistant about learning the game at first, but over the last
several months she's really taken a liking to it, and it's something that really
turns me on. I like seeing her excited about the game I love so much, and I
like seeing her in the stands cheering me on while I play.
Collin and Rhodes have said before that they swear their feet move
faster and their sticks hit the puck better when they know Harper and Ryan
are in the crowd. I always thought they were full of shit, but I get it now.
It's comforting to know there's someone in the stands who doesn't just care
about your game, but about you.
It's also great motivation to work hard, because if I play my cards right
and we win, I'll score twice that night.
They both wave and turn to leave, but they don't make it far before I
hear Zach say to Delia, “I can't believe you didn't recognize him.”
“What? He was sitting down. I couldn't see his ass.”
Hollis snickers. “They were fun, but when she said eight kids, I about
peed myself. I couldn't imagine. I don't even have room for one kid in my
apartment, let alone eight.” She shakes her head, sipping on her water.
“Speaking of…I, uh, found a place that's between the rink and your house.”
I sit up taller in my chair, trying not to let my breath sound as shaky as it
feels in my chest. “Oh?”
“I—I figured it would be nice to be closer to you for when the baby
comes.”
“Yeah, uh, I'd, uh, like that.”
We sound like scratched-up records, skipping around our words. I
especially feel uncomfortable because I have no idea what I'm supposed to
say here.
Should I offer to let her move in? Is that what she's hinting at? If not,
am I supposed to offer to pay for her apartment? I can afford it, so it's not a
big deal, but what's the etiquette here? What is even here?
What are we doing? What are—
“Oh, no!” The waiter comes rushing by our table in a panic. “I gave that
man blue cheese instead of ranch!”
This time, Hollis does vomit.
Whatever here is, we'll have to figure it out later.
18
HOLLIS
“Oh. My. Gosh!”
My mother's screech is so loud it makes my ears ring.
She wraps her arms around me, pulling me into a hug the best she can
since my bump has grown so much. “You look adorable, Hollis!”
I force a grin because I sure don't feel adorable.
I feel gigantic, exhausted, and just plain overwhelmed all the time. If
my feet aren't hurting, it's my back. If I don't have a headache, I'm so tired
I can't keep my eyes open. If I'm not hungry, I'm cranky. It has been
nonstop one thing after the next, and I am really looking forward to these
next few months being over with.
My mother gently cups my protruding belly, and I momentarily feel
guilty because I don't even want her to touch it.
Just Lowell.
“You're beautiful.” She runs her hands over me. “Just beautiful.”
“Mom,” I whine. “Stop.”
“You might as well stop while you're ahead, Mrs. Kelly. She's never
going to listen. I try to tell her every day that she's gorgeous, and she
always argues with me.” Lowell shoots me a look, then sticks his hand out.
“It's great to finally meet you. I'm Cameron.”
My mother looks down her nose at his hand and then at his face, back to
his hand. Finally she slaps it out of the way and pulls him into a giant hug.
“Oh, don't be silly, my dear. Hug me! We're family now!”
It's the first time I've ever heard somebody call Lowell family, and it's
the first time I realize he is family. Even if Lowell and I aren't together, this
baby will always connect us.
That somehow terrifies me and gives me comfort all at once.
My mother shoots me a grin over his shoulder, then winks. He's cute,
she mouths.
And she's right. He is cute. He's really, really cute.
He's cute when he's doing things like rubbing my feet or my belly,
fixing me a snack, or grabbing my phone because I forgot to get it before I
sat down.
But my favorite part of him? My favorite part of him is at night when he
lays his head on my belly and feels our baby move. He does that nearly
every night that he's home, actually. I can't remember the last time we've
spent a night apart from one another.
That's another thing that somehow terrifies me and gives me comfort all
at once. I'm getting so used to him, and I'm starting to worry I'm getting
too used to him.
We've still yet to discuss the mechanics of what happens after the baby
is here. Does he want to move in? Does he want me to move in? Or is he
satisfied with what we're doing now? If he's not satisfied with what we're
doing now, does he want to co-parent, or will he fight for custody? Will he
pay child support, or will he work something else out?
I don't know, and part of me doesn't want to know the answer to any of
these questions. I know that's not logical or smart and this is something we
need to figure out soon, but not now.
Not now because it's Christmastime and my mom just drove across the
state to be here. Though I'll never admit it out loud to her because she'll
give me that look that says I told you so, I missed my mom and I need her
now more than ever.
My mom places her hand on my bump again, then looks at Lowell.
“Blink twice if it's a girl.”
He doesn't react at all.
He's been very tight-lipped about what we're having, and I love his
dedication to it.
“Wait a second—did you just let Mom touch your belly?” Harper asks
from the kitchen. “That's bullshit! You never let me touch it.”
“Really? I touch it all the time,” Lowell says.
Harper waves him off. “You don't count, Dad.”
I don't miss the way he smiles when she calls him that. I've picked up
on how much he enjoys the thought of being a dad, which is exactly why I
got him the cheesiest gift I could think of for Christmas, and I can't wait to
give it to him.
“Oh, hey, guys,” Collin says as he comes padding down the hallway
wearing a pair of joggers with the Comets logo on them. “Sorry, I was
putting the dogs up. They get a little rambunctious once too many people
are here, and I didn't want them bothering anyone.”
He wraps his arms around me in a gentle hug.
It's funny because every time I've seen Collin since I told him I'm
pregnant, he hugs me, only he always does it lightly like he's terrified he's
going to break me by squeezing me too hard.
I know Harper and Collin don't want kids and I completely respect that,
but I also know they're going to make the world's greatest aunt and uncle.
“Hey, Col.” I squeeze him back just as lightly.
“You're huge,” he says, and I feel the moment he realizes what he said.
He releases me and steps back two feet. “I…I mean… You're…”
Lowell takes an aggressive step toward him, stepping in front of me as
if to protect me.
Not going to lie, the move makes me totally wet.
I grab Lowell's shirt, tugging him back. “Down, boy, I know what he
meant.” I turn to Collin. “I think what you meant to say was, Gosh, Hollis,
that baby sure is growing and you're carrying that extra weight that is
definitely not yours so well.”
He flicks a finger gun at me. “That. That's exactly what I meant.”
My mother points to Lowell. “Is this one dumb like this one is?” she
asks, referring to Collin.
“Sometimes,” I answer honestly.
“Hey!” Lowell objects. “I am not.”
“You literally told me two days ago that I was ‘cute for a pregnant
chick.'”
“I didn't… I was…”
Harper walks up and smacks both of them on the back of the head.
“Idiots. Both of you.”
They both turn red at their moments of idiocy.
The doorbell chimes and Harper grabs Collin, dragging him toward the
front door for host duties.
“Come on,” she says. “Let's go pretend to be good hosts and greet the
rest of your idiot friends.”
“They aren't idiots,” he argues.
“I beg to differ. I've met Miller.”
“Eh.” He tips his head back and forth. “Fair.”
“So, Lowell,” my mother says, grabbing his hand and pulling him
toward the kitchen. She hops up on a stool and pats the one next to her,
indicating he should sit too. “Tell me, how did you and my daughter meet
exactly? She's been very hush-hush on the subject.”
My mother and I have been dancing around this subject for months. I
know she would never judge me for what happened, but it doesn't make it
any less embarrassing that I got pregnant by my one-night stand the night of
my sister's wedding. It's even more embarrassing that I punched that onenight stand the day before because I was an emotional wreck.
It's just not something I've wanted to rehash.
“Well, Mrs. Kelly, it's kind of a funny story…” Lowell says, taking a
seat next to her.
She slaps at his shoulder. “Oh, stop with that Mrs. Kelly stuff. I'm not
much of a Mrs. anymore. My bastard cheating husband has been dead for
years.”
She says it lightheartedly, but I know what my father did still hurts her,
even after all these years. Just like even though I'm pregnant and having a
baby with another man, I'm still hurt by what Thad did to me.
Sometimes when I think about everything I've been through in the last
six or seven months, it kind of blows my mind. I jumped from one lifechanging situation to the next with no room to breathe. No wonder I'm so
damn tired all the time.
As if they don't want me to forget about them, the baby moves, and I
lay my hand on my belly to calm them.
“Just call me Evelyn,” my mother tells him. “Or Nana.” She looks at
me. “Just no Grandma or Grandmother. I want a cool, fun, young, hip
nickname.”
“Well, you're not off to a very banging start with that request. Nobody
says hip anymore.”
“Or cool for that matter.”
She waves her hand. “Stop picking on Nana and just tell me the story of
how you two met. Don't leave out a single detail either.”
Much to my dismay, he doesn't.
Not a single one.
By the time he's finished regaling her with the tale of how we met,
everyone—Ryan, Rhodes, Miller, Emilia, and Smith—has arrived for
dinner.
My mother stays quiet through the whole thing, not letting out a single
peep. Then, when he's finally finished embarrassing me in front of
everybody, she looks over at me and says, “Did you throw that punch like
your daddy taught you?”
“Yes, ma'am.”
She nods once. “Good girl. Now let's eat.”
Dinner is finished, most of the mess is cleaned up, and leftovers—what
little there are with several hockey players here—are put away. Harper and I
are standing side by side at the kitchen sink washing dishes.
Lowell has come in here no less than four times trying to get me to go
in there and sit down while he does the dishes, but I keep shoving him out
of the kitchen and back to the giant sunroom everyone is crowded in.
“So,” Harper starts, bumping her shoulder into mine, “how was your
last kid-free Christmas?”
“You mean other than Lowell telling our mother how I punched him?”
She laughs, nodding. “Yes, other than that.”
I grin too. “It was nice. Quiet. Even with Miller here.”
I scrub my brush over the dirty pan, mulling over what she just asked
me. This was my last kid-free Christmas, and that's something that didn't
even cross my mind until Harper brought it up. I've also now had my last
kid-free Halloween and my last kid-free Thanksgiving.
I guess I just never really thought about all the ways those holidays are
going to change for me from now on. I wonder if it's something Lowell's
thought about.
“How are things going with him?” I glance over at her. “Lowell, I mean.
I assume from that dopey grin on your face, that's who you're thinking of.”
“It wasn't a dopey grin.”
“Oh, it totally was. It's very obvious you two are smitten with each
other.”
I decide to ignore that. “Things with Lowell are fine. I think we're both
starting to really get excited about the baby.”
“And is everything else fine?” She bounces her brows up and down.
“Very subtle.” I laugh. “Everything is…nice.”
“Like nice or”—she humps the air—“nice?”
I laugh. “The second one.”
“Yeah?” She bumps my shoulder again. “Good. I like Lowell.”
“I like him too.”
“Like like him?”
“What is this, middle school?”
“Sometimes it feels like it.”
“That's fair. And like like. I think.”
“You think?”
I shrug. “I don't know. I just got divorced, Harper. It's…well, it's sort of
complicated, you know.”
She frowns. “Wow. I kind of forgot about that.”
“I didn't.”
She chuckles. “In that case, just be careful, you know? Nice is…well,
nice and all, but broken hearts suck.”
“So much,” I agree. “But I'll be careful.”
“Good. Because I'd hate to have to help Collin bury his captain's body.”
She shakes her head. “I still cannot believe you're having a baby with a
hockey player.”
“I still cannot believe you're married to a hockey player.” I wave my
hand around the kitchen. “I mean, look at this… Your whole life has
changed.”
Now she's the one with a dopey grin on her face. “I know. And just
think, if I actually had hit him with my car, none of this would have
happened.”
“It is really concerning how bad at night driving you are.”
“It's concerning how bad she is at driving in general,” Ryan says,
bounding into the room with Emilia and my mother hot on her heels. “One
time in college, she ran over her curb so bad she bent the rim and we had to
get it towed. But don't worry, she drove on it like that for three days before
she had it fixed because she couldn't tell the difference between her bad
driving and a bent rim.”
My mother's mouth drops open. “Harper Dolores Kelly!”
“I think you mean Harper Dolores Wright.” My sister grins proudly.
Sometimes with everything crazy that's been going on in my life lately,
I forget she and Collin are still firmly in their honeymoon phase.
I try to think back on my honeymoon phase with Thad, but I can't
remember a time when I ever looked as happy as Harper looks right now. If
I'm being completely honest with myself, whatever is going on with Lowell
is probably the happiest I've been in years.
Which is really damn sad when you think about it.
“So, Mother,” Harper starts, and the way she says it not-so-nonchalantly
has me concerned that I'm not going to like whatever she is about to say.
“Now that the guys are in the other room and we can gab without them
eavesdropping, what did you think of Lowell?”
I shoot my sister a glare. Traitor.
“You mean other than the ass on him?”
“Mother!” I drop the plate I'm holding in the sink, water and bubbles
splashing everywhere.
“What? I have eyes, so you can't really blame me. You girls keep
bringing around all these hockey players, and everybody knows hockey
players have cute butts.”
“It's true. I'm pretty sure there was a study done on it or something.”
“Yeah. It's just science at this point,” Ryan agrees with Emilia.
“I'm like ninety-nine point nine percent sure that's not at all how
science works.”
“How come nobody knows how science works?” I mutter.
“Anyway,” my mother says, ignoring me, “I think he's a catch.”
“A catch? Nobody says that anymore.”
“First I can't say cool or hip, and now I can't say catch?”
Ryan pats her arm. “Don't worry, Evelyn. My grams is very up to date
on all the hottest lingo. She can fill you in on what's in these days.”
“I would love that. Us grandmothers have to stick together.”
I don't tell her Ryan's grandmother is definitely too old for some of the
things that come out of her mouth. I've only met her once at Harper and
Collin's wedding, and the way that woman was flirting with some of the
guys from the team, I was surprised she didn't ask Miller to go home with
her. I was also glad, because he might actually have done it.
“Well, since I can't say he's a catch, can I say that…” A slow,
saccharine grin pulls across her lips. “I like him. I really, really like him.
And he is going to be an amazing father to your baby, Hollis.”
It's probably just the hormones—definitely 100% just the hormones—
but my mother's words have tears pooling in my eyes in an instant. I don't
think I realized how badly I wanted my mother to approve of the father of
my baby.
“Honestly?” She lifts a shoulder. “I'm just glad it's not Thad. That man
was a total douchebag. I can still say that, right?”
“Oh my gosh, thank you!” Emilia agrees. “I have been saying that for
years! He gave me such bad vibes.”
“He really did. He reminded me of your father, actually.”
My mouth slackens. “I had no idea that was how you thought about
him, Mom.”
“I didn't want to say anything because I knew how much you loved
him, and you seemed happy. I thought maybe it was just my own
insecurities about my marriage falling apart, and I didn't think it would be
fair to put that on your relationship. In the end, it turned out I was right, and
that's the last thing I ever wanted.” She looks between Harper and me. “I
know you girls think I'm overprotective and all I want to do is smother you,
and while that may be partially true, I do it because I love you more than
anything and I only want what's good for you.” She looks pointedly at my
belly. “I hope you'll understand that soon too.”
I will. I already do.
“I can tell your man out there with the cute butt does.”
She winks, and we all laugh, the tension in the room breaking.
“All right, who is in here talking about my cute butt again?” Collin says
as he swaggers into the kitchen, followed closely by the rest of the guys.
“Just because someone mentions a nice butt, doesn't mean they are
talking about yours.” Harper pats his cheek.
He snorts. “Right. Sure.”
“They could be talking about mine.” Miller turns around, jutting his
backside out for all to see.
“I can assure you, it was not your ass,” Emilia deadpans.
I don't miss the way Smith's eyes narrow when Emilia looks at Miller's
ass. Much like he did at Harper and Collin's wedding, he catches me staring
at him and flicks his gaze away.
Interesting…
“Rude.” Miller glares. “I think for that, you owe me a present.”
“Is that your way of asking if we can do gifts now?” Harper asks.
He folds his hands under his chin. “Please, Mom?”
She rolls her eyes. “Fine, let's go. Everyone to the big room.”
She waves everyone that way, and they all file out until it's just Lowell
and me. He wraps his arms around my waist just as I'm drying my hands on
the dish towel, and I smile down at the sight, admiring the way his fingers
are splayed out over my bump.
“You up for staying around for gifts?” He presses a kiss into my neck. “I
know you weren't feeling well earlier.”
My doctor isn't too worried about it as long as I keep hydrated, but I'm
still having lots of nausea and am throwing up a few times a week. Parts of
me want to hurry this pregnancy along so I don't have to deal with it
anymore, but a large part of me wants it to slow down too. It's going too
fast, and I admit that I'm a little scared of what's to come next.
“I'm good if you're good.”
“I am.” I turn in his arms. “Besides, I got you something I think you'll
like.”
“Oh, are we doing presents?”
Panic shoots through me. Crap. I didn't even think to ask. I know we're
not together, but I just assumed it would be good for me to get the father of
my baby a Christmas gift. Is that going too far?
He laughs. “I'm kidding. We're doing presents. You should see your
face.”
“You're mean.” I pinch his sides, and he yelps.
“Hey! Be nice. Coach will have your ass if you go damaging this body.”
“I'm not scared of Coach.”
“You should be. He's little but mean.”
“I'm little but mean.”
“True, but you won't hurt me.”
“Yeah?”
“Nah. I'm too much of a catch for you to do that.”
I gasp. “You heard that?”
“I will neither confirm nor deny that all of us guys were standing around
the corner listening in.”
“Cameron!” I hiss. “That's awful!”
He shrugs. “It's good for our ego.”
“Yeah, because everyone's talking about your nice butts.”
“I don't hear you complaining about my nice butt.”
“Eh. It's okay.”
“Okay?” He looks offended. “Just okay?”
“Yep.” I grab his hand, tugging him toward where I can already hear
Miller getting into the gifts. “Now come on. Let's open presents so we can
go home and you can touch my butt.”
His brows rise. “Like really, really touch your butt?”
“Depends on how fast we get these gifts opened.”
Then he's the one tugging me out of the room.

LOWELL
They say absence makes the heart grow fonder. I don't know who the fuck
they were, but they were right.
We are currently on a six-game road trip with a four-game losing streak.
I miss my bed. I miss Hollis' bed. I miss having Hollis near me in my bed.
But most of all? Most of all I miss our baby.
“Well, that was a shit show.” Collin drops onto the bench next to me,
popping his gear off with all the frustration I feel too. “We fucking sucked
out there.”
I'm supposed to be the team captain. I'm supposed to come back with
the rally in response and get us motivated to get out of this slump, supposed
to get us ready and get us out there to win the next game.
But right now, I agree. We fucking sucked out there. We knew it. The
crowd knew it. The other team knew it. Everybody knew it. We were not
playing like the Cup-winning champions I know we can be, and it was
frustratingly embarrassing.
I wish we were at home right now. If I'm playing shit hockey, I'd rather
play shit hockey at home so at least I can go back home to Hollis.
We need to get our heads out of our asses and get those points back.
We're at too crucial of a point in the season to be letting everything slip
away like this.
“Fuck,” Miller groans, plopping down on the other side of me. “How is
it we played that bad and I'm this tired?”
I shrug. “Being away from home sucks.”
“You got that right. I don't know how you guys do it, being away from
your women all the time.” He bumps his shoulder against mine. “Pretty
soon you'll be away from your woman and your kid.”
“She's not my woman.”
He sends me an incredulous look. “Dude, pretty sure she's your woman.
You're having a kid with her.”
“So?”
“So, that makes her yours.”
“Nah. People co-parent all the time.”
“Yeah, but do other people sleep together and co-parent? Oh, wait.
That's not called co-parenting—that's called a relationship,” Rhodes says
from across the room, lifting a brow.
“Hey, now,” Collin chimes in. “Don't go saying the R-word around
Lowell. We all know he'll run and hide.”
I look across the way to Smith, expecting him to back me up, but I don't
find a sympathetic look on his face. If anything, he looks like he agrees
with the Three Stooges over here.
It annoys me that he agrees. Out of everybody in this room, Smith
should know how I feel. He's been married to the game longer than I have.
Hell, he's the one who taught me to shut my feelings off and just play.
That's what I'm doing. I'm shutting down and shutting out everything
else. I'm playing—albeit horribly—but I'm focusing on hockey and the
baby. I'm not thinking about Hollis or how she has the power to crush my
heart. I'm not thinking about that at all.
“Shut up,” I grumble to all of them. “Get dressed. We have a plane to
catch.”
“Oooh, someone's eager to get home to his woman,” Miller taunts.
“I just want you to know, Miller, when he clocks you, I'm going to
laugh and laugh and laugh,” Rhodes says.
“I will also laugh. And possibly hold you down.”
“Hey!” Miller shoots daggers at Collin. “What did I ever do to you?”
“Exist.”
“Is this a normal occurrence in your life?” Miller leans into me, keeping his
voice low as he stares out at the scene in front of us. “Because this is kind
of making me uncomfortable.”
I know what he means. I get uncomfortable dealing with it too.
“Yeah. Happens a few times a week. But…” I lift a shoulder. “It's worth
it. I hope.”
Hollis is currently holding up a baby outfit that has giraffes on it and
sobbing. It's the crying that's making Miller uncomfortable.
He grins. “Yeah, it's worth it. I never thought I'd be into pregnant
chicks, but Hollis looks hot all knocked up.”
I turn toward him with a glare that has him cowering back and holding
his hands up.
“Hey, now…I didn't mean anything by it. I just m-meant that, uh,
um…”
“Miller?” I clench and unclench my fists, trying to talk myself out of
punching the guy at our baby shower.
“Yeah?”
“Go. Away.”
“Roger that.”
He runs away faster than I've ever seen him move on the ice, and that's
saying something because the kid is fast as fuck on skates.
“Those are some rather territorial vibes you're giving off about
somebody you're not even dating.” Smith sidles up next to me, a glass of
whiskey in his hand. “Because you're allegedly still not dating, right?”
I ignore him, staring back out at Hollis, watching as she tosses her head
back and laughs, wiping away her tears. Harper and Emilia are sitting on
either side of her, Ryan on the floor with a pad of paper in her lap, jotting
down notes for thank-you cards later.
My house isn't sprawling big or anything, but I have a lot of room,
especially compared to Hollis' apartment. Though with the mountain of
gifts surrounding her, I have no idea where I'm going to put it all.
Even though our schedule is exhausting and I'm pretty sure they'd all
rather be somewhere else on their off day, the team showed up to support us
in droves. Nearly every single member from our roster is here, and Coach
Heller is over in the corner enjoying the finger foods with his wife. Hell,
even our goalie, who is notorious for not liking kids, is here.
Not that I would ever admit it to any of these bastards, but it feels good
to know they care about us enough to be here today. I know Hollis
appreciates the support too.
She looks at me from across the room, and her face lights up the
moment our eyes connect. She looks happy, so damn happy. It's such a shift
from the mascara-stained crazy woman I met last summer.
Craziest part is I'd take her both ways.
“Come on, man. You can't really tell me you're not dating—not when
you're looking at her like that.”
“I don't know what you're talking about. There's nothing going on.”
It's a lie.
We both know it's a lie.
I hate that we both know it just as much as I hate the look he's giving
me right now.
“Uh-huh. Sure. Right. Nothing at all.”
“What's going on with you and Emilia? Is that nothing too?” I shoot
back, and he snaps his mouth closed, looking a whole lot less cocky. I
smirk. “That's what I thought.”
“Nothing is going on with me and”—he swallows thickly—“her.”
I scoff. “You can't even say her name.”
“I can too.”
“Prove it.”
He tips his chin up. “No. I don't need to prove shit to you.”
“Weird. I don't need to prove shit to you either.”
I shove past him, retreating into the kitchen for something, anything to
get me away from him and his curious stare.
I open the fridge and look around, but I have no idea what I'm looking
for. The baby shower was catered, and there's nothing in here I could
possibly take out there that's going to make any sense.
“Are you hiding?”
In so many ways.
I turn around to find Hollis standing just inside the kitchen, her hand
resting on her very pregnant belly.
The sunlight is poking in behind her, radiating around her like the
beacon of light in a dark stormy night that she is. She's gorgeous, and the
urge to kiss her and touch her overpowers me.
I cross the open kitchen, grabbing her hand and dragging her down the
hallway to my bedroom. I don't stop until we're inside and I have her back
pressed against the door.
She gasps and blinks up at me with surprise when I press my erection
into her.
“I'm not hiding. We're hiding.”
“We are?”
“Yes, and I can't believe you just dragged me in here to ravish me, you
little minx.”
She grins. “Oh, I did?”
“Yes, you did.” I run my nose along her cheek. “And then you
instructed me to push this entirely too sexy dress up and get on my knees so
I can see your pretty cunt.”
She lets out a soft moan, and I haven't even done anything to her yet.
“Lowell…we have guests.”
“So? They can wait. Besides, I'll be quick.” I wink.
I sink to my knees, grab the hem of her dress, and lift. She has to adjust
herself when the dress gets to her belly, and she sighs in frustration.
“Ugh. I'm so…”
I stop, looking up at her with a sharp stare. “I know you weren't just
about to say something disparaging about your body, Hollis.”
She shakes her head. “N-No.”
“Are you lying to me?”
“Depends. Will I get punished if I am?”
I start to push to my feet, and she quickly shoves me back down.
“Fine! Yes, I was going to say something about my…situation. You
happy?”
“No.”
I hook my fingers into her panties, then drag them down her legs. I grab
one leg and haul it over my shoulder, loving the way she shivers when the
cool air hits her exposed pussy.
“One compliment, one lick.”
“Huh?”
I look up at her. “You say one compliment about yourself, and this
beautiful pink cunt of yours gets one lick.”
“O-One lick? It'll take more than that.”
“Then keep talking.”
“I…I don't have anything to say. I—”
I go to push to my feet again, and she lets out a little squeak.
“I'm beautiful!” she shouts out, and I grin at the urgency in her voice.
I swipe my tongue over her, and she sighs. I pull away, and she
whimpers.
“Keep going,” I encourage.
“I…I'm…I'm gorgeous.”
Another swipe.
“I'm adorable.”
Another taste.
“I'm cute.”
Another lick.
“I'm sexy.”
Another stroke.
“I'm yours.”
Mine.
I suck her clit into my mouth, and she cries out, her fingers tangling in
my hair, playing with the strands as I get lost in the taste of her. I suck and
kiss and eat, fucking her with my fingers and tongue, and I don't let up until
her legs are shaking and I'm practically holding her up.
“Please, Cameron. Please.”
I rub that spot inside of her I know she likes and suck on her clit until
she explodes, her body going stiff for a moment before coming down from
her high. I sit back, admiring my work as she leans against the door, her
legs still shaky and her breaths even shakier.
We don't talk as I slip her panties back up her legs and right her dress
before wiping my face and leading us back out to the party. In fact, we
don't utter a word all day until we lie down that night and slip between my
sheets, where we use our bodies to speak all the words we could never say.

HOLLIS & LOWELL
Lowell: Gordie?
Hollis: Umm…no.
Lowell: Howe?
Hollis: How what?
Lowell: No. Like Gordie Howe.
Hollis: Goldie Hawn???
Lowell: What? NO!
Lowell: GORDIE HOWE
Hollis: Never heard of her.
Lowell: I…
Lowell: I thought your hockey knowledge was much more up
to par than this.
Lowell: I have failed you.
Lowell: In fact, I'm retiring right now. I cannot, in good
conscience, have a baby with a woman who doesn't know
who Gordie Howe is.
Hollis: You'll get over it.
Lowell: Sorry. I can't come to the phone right now. I'm dead.
Hollis: And dramatic. Don't forget dramatic.
Hollis: Um…sir?
Lowell: Okay, first, I didn't realize that would be hot.
Hollis: It's not happening, so move on.
Lowell: *grumbles* Fine. Moving on.
Lowell: How may I help you, ma'am?
Hollis: Did you have a pizza delivered to my apartment?
Specifically a heart-shaped one?
Lowell: Oh. That.
Lowell: Yeah, it was me.
Hollis: Why????
Lowell: Because it's Valentine's Day.
Lowell: Our baby might not be here yet, but I wanted to make
sure Momma was taken care of.
Hollis: That's…really sweet. Like really, really sweet.
Hollis: I kind of want to kiss you right now.
Lowell: I'd let you.
Hollis: I'm sure you would.
Lowell: I wish we weren't on the road AGAIN.
Lowell: Fuck, I hate road games.
Lowell: Especially because I'm always stuck on the bus next
to Miller and he never wants to shut the hell up.
Hollis: Miller shuts up?
Lowell: No. Literally never.
Lowell: Right now, he's telling me the same story he started
telling me ON THE PLANE.
Lowell: That was HOURS ago.
Lowell: And it's not even a good story. I guessed the ending
two minutes into it.
Hollis: Tell him to pipe down.
Lowell: I have. I do.
Lowell: Next time, I'm bringing duct tape.
Hollis: He'll probably just lick it off.
Lowell: Probably.
Lowell: How's work going? Getting ahead like you wanted to?
Hollis: Yes, though I think I'm going to call it a night. I'm tired.
Baby is sucking up all my energy today.
Lowell: Go rest, then. Take your pizza to bed and spoon with it
and pretend it's me.
Hollis: That's not weird at all.
Lowell: Hey, I know some people who take their pizza very
seriously and wouldn't bat an eye.
Hollis: I am really scared to know if you're “some people.”
Lowell: Guess you'll never know.
Hollis: See you tomorrow?
Lowell: Yes.
Lowell: Oh, and happy Valentine's Day.
Lowell: I'll give you your present tomorrow. *tongue emoji*
Lowell: Elsa?
Hollis: She's a total badass, but no.
Hollis: What about Georgia?
Lowell: Like the state?
Hollis: Yes.
Lowell: Hmm…I don't hate it.
Hollis: This would be a lot easier if I knew what we were
having…
Lowell: It would be, except you don't want to know,
remember?
Lowell: In fact, you promised me bodily harm if I tried to tell
you.
Hollis: So you're saying you're scared of me?
Lowell: HA! Not a chance.
Lowell: But also…yes.
Lowell: Then again, if you punched me, it wouldn't be the first
time.
Hollis: LOWELL!
Hollis: I swear, if you keep bringing that up…
Lowell: It was traumatic!
Hollis: It was not! If anything, it probably turned you on.
Hollis: Lowell?
Hollis: Oh god.
Hollis: It did, didn't it??
Hollis: LOWELL!
Hollis: Oh, wait. I just realized you're probably playing hockey
right now.
Hollis: GO TEAM! TOUCHDOWN!
Hollis: I think the doctor missed flirting with you today.
Lowell: I'm sorry I couldn't be there.
Hollis: Me too.
Lowell: How'd it go?
Hollis: Everything is looking good. Baby is healthy.
Lowell: And Momma?
Hollis: She's healthy too. Just hungry.
Lowell: What do you want? I'll send you food.
Hollis: You don't have to send me food every time I'm hungry.
I'm a big girl. I can feed myself.
Hollis: Besides, I have another appointment to get to.
Lowell: Another one?
Lowell: I don't see anything on my Google calendar.
Hollis: It's for an apartment viewing.
Lowell: Oh.
Lowell: Is that what you want? A bigger apartment?
Hollis: More like I NEED a bigger one.
Hollis: Hell, YOU barely fit in this one.
Hollis: Besides, it'll be nice to be closer to you and the rink
and everything. Makes it easier on everyone for when the
baby comes.
Lowell: Because you'll be there, and I'll be here.
Hollis: Exactly.
Lowell: That is what you want, right?
Hollis: Are you coming over tonight?
Lowell: Probably not. Early morning at the rink. Rain check?
Hollis: Sure.
Lowell: Night.

HOLLIS
“Oh shit,” I groan, sitting up on the couch where I fell asleep watching
Lowell's hockey game.
I rub a hand across my forehead, a dull throb beginning. I feel like I've
been run over, but I assume that's because I didn't sleep well last night
alone in my bed. I spent way too much time thinking and tossing and
turning and not enough time sleeping.
I place a hand on my belly, trying to soothe the slight cramps I'm
having, my stomach clearly not agreeing at all with the burrito I had for
lunch. I check the score on the game and see that the Comets are losing
with just seven to go in the third, and if they lose, Lowell is going to be in a
mood when he comes over.
If he comes over.
He hasn't for the last few nights, which is not like him at all. In fact, I
can't remember the last time we didn't spend the night together when he's
had a home game. Not having him in my bed feels wrong, like so wrong it
makes my stomach hurt. Or maybe that's the burrito.
The worst part is, I don't know whether it's something I did wrong or if
he's feeling wrong about something we're doing, but neither option sits
right with me.
My stomach cramps again, and I wince at the pain.
“Sorry about that, baby. Momma promises not to get burritos from that
food truck ever again.”
I wonder if it was the burrito though, because I didn't feel all that great
yesterday either.
“How about this? If Momma isn't feeling better in the morning, she'll
call the doctor, okay?”
The baby kicks as if they agree, and I grin.
The first time I felt a flutter, I cried. Lowell was sleeping next to me,
and I cried so hard I woke him up with my sobs. Then we stayed up until
two AM just feeling our baby move.
The movements are a lot more than just a flutter now, and I'm almost
positive these little moments between us are what I'm going to miss most
about being pregnant.
I keep my hand on my belly and turn my attention back to the game.
The time starts to move fast on the clock, and the Comets are still down a
goal. There are only three minutes left now, and they pull their goalie.
I know this can always be a huge gamble to take. They can either make
up the point they're missing, or they're giving the other team a chance to
score an empty-netter and seal the deal.
Unfortunately, favor is not with them tonight, because not even ten
seconds into the man advantage, the other team sends the puck flying down
the ice and right into the empty net. The camera operator zooms in on
Lowell's face on the bench, and he looks completely defeated and
disappointed. I know how bad they need these points tonight, but the
chances are looking slim right now.
Another bad cramp hits me, and I'm almost starting to wonder if this is
more than I think it is.
I push off the couch to head into the bathroom, and the moment I do, I
know this is more than I think it is. The room feels all wobbly and wonky
and off, and I feel like I might pass out. I collapse back onto the couch,
trying to catch my breath. My head begins to throb, and I feel like there are
a thousand little elephants dancing inside of it.
Something is wrong.
I reach for my phone and begin to call Lowell, then remember he's in
the middle of a game. He can't answer or do anything about it.
Instead, I dial Harper.
She answers almost immediately.
“Please tell me you are watching this game. This is miserable. They
need these points so badly. Collin is going to be so upset when he gets
home. I—”
“Harper,” I cut her off sharply.
“What's wrong?” she says, and I can already hear the panic setting into
her voice. It's the same panic that's setting into me too. “Is something
wrong? Is everything okay?”
“I need you to take me to the hospital.”
I hear Lowell before I see him.
“Where the fuck is she?” he growls, and I feel bad for whichever nurse
he's snarling at right now. “Where is Hollis?”
Not even five seconds later, he comes barreling into the tiny room I'm
in.
His eyes are wide as he takes me in all hooked up to the machines, his
lips set with worry as he rushes toward me. He just stands there and stares
and stares and stares some more. His eyes are glassy and panicked, and his
breaths are coming in sharp.
Then everything snaps back to reality for him, and he crosses the room,
taking my face in his hands.
“Is the baby okay?”
He runs his hands over my cheeks and through my hair, looking me
over for any signs of damage. There are none; it's all internal.
I love that the first thing out of his mouth is about the baby.
“The baby is fine,” I promise him. “Just a little scare.”
He sags against me in relief, pressing a hard kiss to my forehead. “What
happened? Harper didn't tell me anything, just said I needed to get here. I
came straight after the game.”
“Harper can be so dramatic.”
“Dramatic?” He nods toward all the stuff I'm hooked up to. “Then
what's all this?”
“Monitors for me and the baby. I also had to pee in a cup, which is very
hard when you're this pregnant. And they checked my cervix, which was
almost more painful than the reason I came in.”
“And that was for?”
“I felt a little lightheaded and had a bad headache, some cramps.”
“Cramps? Like Braxton Hicks?”
“You know what Braxton Hicks are?”
“What?” He shrugs. “I read.”
I grin. “It wasn't Braxton Hicks. These were different. Just…
uncomfortable. I was a little dehydrated.”
He pulls back and tips his head. “Dehydrated? Like you're not drinking
enough water?”
“I thought I was. I've been peeing enough that it feels like I am.”
His brows are drawn tightly together as he steps away from me, and it's
a good thing because I do not like the look he's giving me right now.
“Hollis, you pee all the time, even when you shouldn't be peeing. You have
a baby pressing down on your bladder. That doesn't mean you're drinking
enough.”
“I-I'm sorry. I thought…”
He shakes his head. “It's not just you, Hollis. This is about my baby
too.”
I whip my head back at his words, surprised. I have no idea where his
sudden hostility and frustration is coming from, but I know I don't deserve
it. The baby is okay, and that's all that matters.
“Our baby.”
“You know what I mean.”
I glare at him. “No, sorry. I don't.”
“It's reckless of you to not—”
“Reckless? Reckless? You act like I did this on purpose! I've been sick,
Lowell! It's not my fault.”
“Sick?”
“Yes! And you'd know that if you were around.”
“Oh god.” He rolls his eyes. “Excuse me if I've been busy playing
hockey. You know I can't always be around during the season.”
“You've had no problems with it until recently.”
“What's that supposed to mean?”
“It means, in case you haven't noticed, you haven't exactly been around
lately.”
He hasn't. Not for days. He hasn't come over. He's barely texted me.
He's been pulling away whether he's ready to admit it or not.
“I've been playing hockey! In the NHL!”
“Stop saying that! Stop saying that like it matters or changes anything.
Every other night this season you've had no problem spending the night in
my bed.”
“Is that what this is?” He scoffs, pacing back and forth with a look of
disgust lining his features. “You're mad because I haven't been around to
fuck you?”
The air is sucked out of my lungs at his words, and I swear if I wasn't
all hooked up, I would be out of this bed and out of this room so fast
because I cannot stand to be in it with him for another minute.
I have no idea who I'm looking at right now. Whoever it is, it's not
Lowell.
This isn't the same man who has spent countless nights rubbing my
back or helping me up to pee in the middle of the night. This isn't the same
man who had a heart-shaped pizza delivered to me just a few weeks ago
because he was worried I wasn't eating enough. This isn't the same man
who looks at me like I'm the only person in the world. This isn't the same
man who looks at me, especially not when he's staring through me right
now.
This man? This isn't the man who makes me feel like I'm his.
I don't know this man, and I don't want to know him either.
“I—”
The door is pushed open, and I snap my mouth shut, not wanting to
argue with Lowell in front of the doctor.
She beams at us, walking farther into the room. “Ah! Your husband is
here. That's—”
“We're not together. I'm just the dad.”
My heart drops, and I know if I were standing up right now, I'd need to
sit down.
His words are harsh and final, and even though I know we never
defined just what it is we're doing, I didn't expect it to feel like I'm having
my heart ripped out of my chest at the way he insists we're nothing.
I'm not asking for a ring or a commitment, but does what we've spent
the past several months doing really mean nothing to him?
Because it means something to me.
By the tone in his voice, it means too much to me.
Lowell isn't looking at me. He's only staring at the doctor, who is
shifting her eyes between the two of us.
“Well?” Lowell prompts, lips flattened in a frown.
The doctor clears her throat. “You're being released, Miss Kelly.
Everything is looking much better now. Just need to make sure you're
drinking lots of fluids.” She turns to Lowell. “Maybe grab a sports drink or
two on the way home, Mr. Lowell. As an athlete, I'm sure you're aware of
the benefits of replenishing your electrolytes.” She turns back to me.
“Sound good? Any questions for me before we get you discharged?”
“No, Dr. Kane, thank you so much for your help today. I really
appreciate it.”
She smiles. “It's no problem at all. We see this happen from time to
time, especially when the mother-to-be is under stress. Just make sure
you're resting, taking breaks when you can, and trying to avoid any stress
triggers. It can make that mommy brain even worse.” She winks. “I'll get
these to the front desk, and we'll get you on your way shortly.”
She shuffles out of the room, leaving us to slowly die in this oxygendeprived space.
“Is that what you want, Lowell?”
He snaps his eyes up. “Huh?”
“When the baby comes…is that what you want to be? Just the dad?”
He knows what I'm asking.
He knows what I'm asking, and he just stands there. He doesn't answer.
Just stares at me…through me.
I hate it so much.
And in this moment, I hate him so much.
“I—”
“Pardon me, Mr. Lowell, but we wanted to go over some insurance
information with you.”
He clamps his mouth shut, sending me one last glance before following
the doctor out of the room, and I have my answer.
I'm not alone long enough to let the reality of what just happened
simmer before a nurse comes in and helps get me unhooked and out of bed.
She's dropping me into a wheelchair—hospital policy—when she asks, “Do
you have someone to take you home?”
“They'll be waiting outside.”
She nods, then wheels me through to the front entrance. She's helping
me out of the wheelchair and into the car when Lowell comes skidding out
of the sliding glass door of the hospital.
“Hollis, wait!” he calls out, jogging down the sidewalk to us.
“Thanks,” I say to the nurse. “We got it from here.”
She glances from me to Lowell, making sure I'm good, then takes the
wheelchair and leaves.
“You can't be serious,” Lowell says, coming to a stop before me.
“You're leaving with Harper?”
“What does it matter to you who I leave with, Lowell? We're not
together, remember?”
He opens his mouth to say something, then snaps it closed. He knows
they're his words I'm hurling back at him, which is why he can't even
defend himself right now.
“I'll text you.” And I will. I'm pregnant with his baby. I'm not shutting
him out. I turn to Harper, who is shooting a nasty look Lowell's way. “Let's
go.”
She helps me into her car, glaring at him the entire time. When we're
about to pull away, she sighs, and I know she's about to dive into the I told
you so speech.
“Don't,” I say to her quietly. “Please. Not now.”
Another sigh, then a nod.
I watch Lowell disappear in the rearview mirror, leaving half of my
heart in the hospital parking lot.
22
LOWELL
I can't even begin to count the number of times I've been hurt in all my
years of playing hockey. I've had broken bones. I've taken one-hundredplus-mile-per-hour pucks in places people should never take pucks. I've lost
teeth. I've been beaten to the point of being unable to walk for days.
I've played through it all.
But this hurt? I'm not sure I can handle it.
And this time, it's all my fault.
I fucked up.
I fucked up big, and not just out on the ice where we blew a three-toone lead yesterday and lost seven to three because my head was completely
out of the game.
No. I fucked up long before tonight, so many times in fact.
I should have never kissed Hollis.
I should have never slept with her.
I should have never kept sleeping with her.
And I definitely, one hundred percent should not have fallen in love
with her.
But I did, I did, I did, and I so fucking did.
Standing in that hospital room seeing her with all those straps and
monitors on her broke me. It broke me and it fucking scared me that it
broke me, because this isn't about us. It was never supposed to be about us.
Things with Hollis were never supposed to be this serious. One time,
one night, and we move on. One night and we act like it never happened.
She wasn't supposed to still be around, and she definitely wasn't supposed
to get pregnant.
This whole thing has been a mess from the beginning, and I only have
myself to blame for giving in to the temptation and breaking my rule that
hockey comes first no matter what. I don't know the exact moment I fell for
her—probably when she punched me—but I know the exact moment I
realized I couldn't love her. I can't love her because if I do, I can lose her. If
I never love her at all, I'll never know what it feels like to lose her, and I
can walk away intact.
But that's bullshit.
It's always been bullshit.
I know that now. I know that because I'm sitting on this godforsaken
bench in a million shattered pieces, and I have no clue how to put myself
back together.
“How do you want it?”
I sigh, because I knew I'd be hearing from him at some point. I finish
lacing up my skates, then look at Collin, who is standing over me with his
arms crossed and a murderous stare etched into his eyes.
He's pissed, and I don't blame him one bit.
I sit back, meeting his ire because I deserve it and I know I do.
“How do I want what?”
“Your death. Poisoning? Axe? Arrow? Shovel? Rope? Knife?
Chainsaw? Spoon? Take your pick.”
“Fuck off. I'm not in the mood for your games.”
“Oh, trust me—this isn't a game.”
Imagine my fucking surprise when he actually pulls a spoon out of his
back pocket and whacks me on top of the head with it.
“OW! What the…”
He grabs me by the sweater, pulling me off the bench and tugging me
until we're nearly touching noses.
“Fuck off, Wright,” I seethe, ignoring the surprised cries of What the
fuck from our teammates, who are already half-dressed getting ready for
practice. “It's not your battle.”
“Bullshit it's not. Your girl has been on my couch for the last week
while my girl is fixing her. It's my problem as much as it's yours.”
He pulls me close until we're nose to nose, and I grab his sweater,
shoving at him, but he doesn't budge. “Leave it alone.”
“No!” he roars.
I shove him again, catching his chin with my fist that's holding his
sweater. It's the first hit, and it's all it takes for his eyes to darken and for
him to take a swing at me.
I let him hit me. I let him hit me because I deserve it and so much more.
I don't know how long he hits me. I stop counting, and I stop hitting
back. I just take it, accepting my punishment.
Because this? What's happening right now? It's nothing compared to
how I'm feeling on the inside.
“Dude, dude. Whoa. Come on, man, that's enough, all right? Chill out.”
Rhodes pulls on him, trying to drag him away. He doesn't relent, and I
like that he doesn't relent. I like that he's here having Hollis' back. I've
never been happier to be hit in my entire life.
“What the fuck is going on in here?!”
Collin drops me the instant Coach blazes into the room, a glower
marring his face as he takes in the sad state of each of us. His hands are on
his hips, his lips pressed and angry. He shakes his head, looking completely
disgusted by both of us.
“Is this what we're doing now, huh? Fighting each other instead of the
other team?” He scoffs. “Fucking despicable.” He points a finger at Collin.
“Scratched, starting tonight.” Then he points to me. “You? Two games.
You're supposed to be leading this team, especially right now when we
need it the most. Instead, you're in here fighting with your own teammates.
You know better than that, Captain.”
I hate the way he spits the word at me.
I don't feel like a captain. Especially not right now.
I nod, accepting it.
“Good. Now get the fuck out on that ice and leave whatever this bullshit
is in here. Understood?” He laughs derisively, shaking his head and
muttering as he walks out. “Fuckin' children. All a bunch of children.”
The door slams shut behind him and the room is completely quiet,
everyone just watching to see what's going to happen next between Collin
and me.
We stare each other down for a long time until finally, Rhodes lays a
hand on his shoulder.
“We got practice, man. This is over.”
“It's not. It's not over. He doesn't get to just break her and walk away.
That's not how it works.”
“Break her?” I mutter. “I didn't break her. She broke me.”
Collin whirls back around, ready for more. “What'd you say?”
“I said I didn't break Hollis. She broke me, and I love her, okay?” I
shove myself up, staggering just slightly from being knocked around like a
punching bag. I rub at my jaw that's already throbbing, trying to catch my
breath that just won't seem to come. “I love her. Are you fucking happy
now?”
“No,” Collin seethes. “I won't be happy until she's happy, and you have
a lot of fucking fixing to do.”
“This is all your fault,” I say to Smith as we head into the building for the
game tonight—the game I won't be playing in because I'm a healthy
scratch.
Everyone knows that's the worst kind of scratch to be. It means you've
screwed up and now you have to pay by forcing your team to pick up the
slack without you while you sit in the box with the night off, watching the
repercussions of your actions.
It fucking sucks, and it especially blows because Coach wants Collin
and me up in the box together. Based on the bruises on my face and the split
lip he's rocking, it's clear we got into it with one another. The press is going
to have a fucking field day with it no doubt.
“Yeah? And how's that exactly?”
“You told me to ask her to dance, and I did. If I hadn't, I wouldn't be in
this mess at all.”
His brows rise, and I hate that the look he's giving me says we both
know that's not true. I think even if Hollis and I hadn't danced that night,
we would have still ended up in that garden together, wrapped around one
another like a clandestine meeting under the stars.
If we hadn't, Smith would have told me to ask her to dance.
He knew all along.
Fucker.
“What are you going to do?”
I look back at Fiona. The only thing I want to do is jump inside of her
and drive to Hollis and tell her how sorry I am.
But I can't. I have to be here, for a hockey game I'm not even fucking
playing in because Coach is sadistic.
“I'm going to fix it. Eventually.”
“How?”
“I don't know.”
“This might sound fucking nuts, but have you tried honest
communication?”
I snort. “Like you've tried with Emilia?”
“My situation is a little more…complicated.”
“And mine isn't?”
“No. It's pretty straightforward if you just get your head out of your ass
and look at it from a non-damaged perspective.”
“But I am damaged.”
He stops walking, turning to me. “You're right. You are—but so is
Hollis. She got divorced less than a year ago because her husband was
cheating on her. Then she got pregnant right after. She's damaged too, but
guess what? She's not going around putting up walls and blocking people
out because she's afraid. She's facing this shit head-on, which is a lot more
than I can say for you.”
I…fuck. He's right. I know he's right.
“I know.” I scrub a hand over my face, exhaling sharply. “I know, okay?
I'm an idiot. A bigger idiot than Miller.”
“Yeah, you are,” Miller says as he walks by shooting me judgy eyes.
Shit. Even the rookie is on my case.
Smith sighs. “I've put my life on hold for my career. I've been married
to this game for longer than you've been alive. Hockey is my life, but it
doesn't have to be yours. So, if you love her and there's a chance for you to
have a family, take that chance. Because trust me, Lowell, these years?
They're going to fly by fast, and before you know it, you'll be an old man
like me signing one-year contracts hoping you can hold on to the game you
love for just a little longer because you know when it's over, you'll truly be
alone.”
I swallow, my mouth sticky and dry just thinking about living a life
without Hollis in it. I mean, yeah, we'll always be connected because of the
baby, but just thinking of another man raising my child too, another man
touching her…knowing her the way I do…
I can't stomach it.
It's supposed to be me.
I'm yours, she promised.
Mine, I swore.
“Tell her, Lowell.”
23
HOLLIS
“All right, tell me what's going on.”
My brows scrunch together. “I don't know what you mean. Nothing's
going on.”
Emilia looks at me with shrewd eyes. “Hmm, nice try. But you're my
best friend and I know you better than that. So, tell me…what happened?”
Everything happened.
“It was…nothing.”
“It wasn't nothing. You were dehydrated and in the hospital, so it clearly
wasn't nothing.”
Oh. That's what she's talking about.
“Right. It was just that—a little dehydration, but I'm better now.”
“Good. I'm glad. Now tell me about what happened with Lowell.”
My heart leaps into my throat just hearing his name. “W-What about
him?”
“Why is he moping around the rink?”
He is?
I think in another life at another time, it would give me a bit of
satisfaction to know he's hurting like I'm hurting.
But it doesn't. If anything, it makes me feel worse.
A small wave of discomfort surges through my belly, and I rub it to help
soothe it. I take a mental note of the time like I have been all day since they
began in the wee hours of the morning. They're getting closer together and
more painful, that's for sure.
“I don't know what you mean,” I say to her, pushing through the
discomfort.
“Yes, you do. Start talking.”
I know she's not going to give up. To be fair, I knew she wasn't going to
give up when she came over here tonight when she's supposed to be
working. She took a personal day just to spend time with me. I love her for
it, but I also would have been fine having a night to myself to sulk.
I finally convinced Harper to stop “dropping by” to check on me, to not
swoop me out of my apartment for a “girls' day” and kidnap me to take me
to her house and watch the game tonight, which Collin is back in action for
after being a healthy scratch last night.
I was at their house when he came back from practice with a busted lip.
I didn't ask how he got it. I already knew.
It made me love that Collin is going to be my baby's uncle just a little
more in that moment. I know they'll always be safe with him around.
I fill Emilia in on everything. What happened at the hospital, what
happened before that. Everything that's been running through my mind for
the last several months.
When I'm finished, she doesn't say anything for several long moments.
Then, her lips pull into a soft smile, the bun of beautiful red hair piled up
high tipping sideways with her head tilt. “You love him, don't you?”
I sink my teeth into my bottom lip. “I do. But that's bad, right? I…I just
got out of a long-term relationship. Hell, out of a marriage. I can't be in
love with someone else already, can I?”
“Of course you can. There's no timeline on things like this, Hollis. Is
that what's been holding you back?”
In a way, it is. I didn't tell Harper that because, no offense to her, she
wouldn't understand. She doesn't know what it's like to promise yourself to
someone and have them betray you in the worst way possible.
Emilia…she understands.
“Yes. No. I don't know. We never officially defined what we were, you
know? We just…were. Until we weren't.”
“But it felt like you were dating, didn't it?”
I nod. “Yes.”
As much as I told myself not to, I got attached to him. I got attached to
us.
“When the doctor came into the room and called him my husband…” I
trail off, conjuring up the image of the look on his face when she said that
with ease. “He said he was just the dad. That was it.”
I can't stop thinking about the way he looked at me in that hospital
room. He looked angry and scared and hurt and back to scared. I get it—I
was scared too.
But it was more than that with him. He looked unsure. About us…about
everything.
That scared me more than anything else. I can't open my heart to
someone again and then get hurt. I just can't. I have more than me to think
about. I have my baby too.
“I see the wheels turning in your head, and you're a fool if you think
that man doesn't love you, Hollis. I've seen the way he looks at you. You
mean the world to him. I'd wager to bet you mean more than the world to
him. He won't hurt you. I know he won't.”
“Giving him that power though…”
“Trust me,” she says, “I know better than anyone how scary that is. I
mean, look at me, it's been nearly three years since The Dick Who Shall
Not Be Named, and I still can't get over it.”
If I thought what I went through with Thad was a roller coaster, it's
almost nothing compared to what happened with Emilia and her ex. I don't
blame her for not being ready, though I do think some of that has to do with
a certain older hockey player…
“But I think of all people in the world, Lowell might just be worth
putting your heart on the line for. You need to talk to him. Tell him how
you're feeling. Be honest with him.”
Truthfully, I think she's right. Hell, I know she's right. I can either put
my heart out there and see what happens, or I can hurt and suffer alone.
I've never really been one to run from my problems, and I'm not about
to start now.
“I will. I'll talk to him and I'll tell him how I feel. I—”
Another tidal wave of pressure hits me, and I press on my belly once
again.
Emilia notices this time. “Are you okay?”
“Uh…yes.” I wince.
“Are you sure?”
“Maybe? I'm cramping.”
“How long have you been cramping?”
“Inconsistently? All day. Consistently? A few hours now, I think.”
“A few hours…” she mutters. “Hollis, are you…”
“Oh god.” I lurch forward, my stomach really hurting now.
“Talk to me. Tell me what's happening. Is this like when you felt
dehydrated?”
“No, no. This is…I…I don't know. Something else—oh!” Yet another
wave of pain courses through me.
“Are you in labor?”
“No! Yes! I can't be! I don't even have my go bag packed!”
“Yes, I am certain that is exactly what your baby is waiting on—you to
be prepared with your go bag.”
“Not”—another wave, another sharp inhale—“helping, Emilia.”
“Okay,” she says, standing. “Up. We're going to the hospital.”
“What?” I swat at her. “No. I'm telling you, it's nothing. I'd know if I
were in labor. I'd—”
“Are you peeing on the couch?!”
I look down and—yep, there's a pool of fluid turning the light gray
couch into a dark one.
Oh no…
“Uh, Emilia? I think I might be in labor.”
“No shit! Come on, up. We're leaving.”
She grabs me, helping me off the couch, tossing her purse over her
shoulder as she rushes to get shoes on.
Another contraction hits me.
Oh my god.
Have I been in labor all day and not realized it? My stomach has been
hurting worse through the day, but I shouldn't be in labor yet. I'm only 38
weeks. I still have time…
“Okay, let's go,” she says, leading me to the door.
“My phone!”
“Your—where is it?”
I point to the couch, still trying to breathe through the pain since it's
lasting for about a minute each time now. “I need to call…”
“Who? Who do you need me to call?”
“Lowell. I need Lowell.”
24
LOWELL
I'm about to be a dad.
Me.
I can't believe it.
“Can you not move this truck any faster? I know it's falling apart, but
shit, you're driving like you're about to be a grandpa, not a dad.”
We're fifteen minutes away from the hospital stuck in traffic. It's
moving, but not fast enough.
Fucking game days.
I spare Harper a glare. “I can only go as fast as traffic.”
“Bullshit you can. Get this baby up on the shoulder. Drive around.”
“Do you have no sense of legalities when it comes to driving?”
“No.”
“Remind me why I brought you again?”
“Uh, because you need me!”
I huff out a laugh. “More like because you accosted me.” I shake my
head. “I don't know what it is with you Kelly women just butting into other
people's business.”
“Lowell, I swear, I will pinch your nipple if you do not just shut up and
drive. I don't want to miss the birth of my niece or nephew!”
“And you think I want to miss the birth of my child?”
“Then drive!” she yells.
And I do.
I take Fiona right up on the shoulder of the road and I gas it.
We look crazy. Completely bonkers. What we're doing is illegal, and if
the Comets aren't pissed that I ran out of the game without serving the
second day of my healthy scratch, they'll really be pissed after they find out
about this.
Harper's phone beeps with a notification.
“It's Emilia,” she says. “She says they got her in a room and are waiting
for the doctor.”
“How dilated is she?”
“Ew, gross. I do not want to know how big my sister's cervix is.”
“Harper…”
“Fine. It's a three.”
“Okay, okay. So, we have time. That's good.”
I slow the truck down as I inhale a sharp breath through my nose, then
exhale through my mouth. I am out-of-this-fucking-world nervous. In fact,
the last time I was this nervous was during the Cup Final. I would have
never told the boys because they didn't need to see me sweat, but I was
freaking.
That's nothing compared to this though.
“Are you doing Lamaze?”
“What? I've been watching some videos on YouTube. Sue me.”
Hollis and I spent hours sitting in her bedroom learning breathing
techniques. We'd practice until we'd start laughing.
Then we'd start kissing. And that always led to more.
“It's cute,” she says. She reaches over, squeezing my arm. “You're
going to be a good dad, Lowell.”
I swear to fuck someone is cutting onions in this truck because tears
spring to my eyes. I will them back, sniffling. If Harper notices, she doesn't
say anything, and I like that she doesn't say anything.
“Are you excited to be an aunt?”
“Yeah. I'm going to be amazing at it. I already have a bunch of coffee
and sugar at home.”
“I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to tell the parents you're going to
feed their child caffeine and sugar.”
“Oh. Well, then, I definitely do not have any coffee or sugar at home.
Absolutely zero.”
I snort, then put my blinker on. I might be an asshole for driving on the
side of the road, but at least I have some manners.
We pull into the parking lot and find a spot.
Then, I sit there. I sit there because I am having a complete and total
panic attack and oh my god I can't believe this is actually happening right
now. I can't believe this is happening when Hollis and I haven't spoken in
days.
I thought I'd have more time. I thought I might still have weeks to
convince her I'm madly in love with her and want to spend the rest of my
life showing her that.
“Lowell? You okay? You stopped Lamaze-ing.”
I chuckle at that because it's not a real word and it breaks my tension.
“I'm okay. I'm just…”
“I know,” she says. “I get it. But you need to pull your head out of your
ass and get in there. It's a team effort and you need to support each other
right now. Your girl—my sister—is waiting for you. Don't make her do this
alone.”
I grin at her. “You know, you wouldn't be too bad behind the bench. We
could use a motivator like you.”
“I know. Now, go tell my sister you love her.”
“Yes, Coach.”
“I'm looking for Kelly. Hollis Kelly.”
“Who are you?” the nurse at the station asks.
“Her…boyfriend. And the father.”
“Oh!” she says excitedly. “We were wondering when you'd get here.
Follow me. I'll take you to her. I was just about to go do my check-in.”
I follow the short nurse down the hall, Lamaze-ing the whole way
down.
“Nice technique,” she says over her shoulder, pushing the door open.
All my technique goes right out the window when I see Hollis lying in
the bed. She looks…well, fucking gorgeous.
And in pain. Her eyes are squeezed tightly shut and she's holding her
stomach, trying hard to breathe in and out of her nose. She does this for
what seems like forever, and all I can do is watch.
“Oh, thank god! You're here!” Emilia says from behind me, walking
into the room carrying two big cups full of ice, a soda tucked under one
arm. “She's been dying for some water.”
I don't think Hollis hears any of this because when the contraction
finally subsides and she peels her eyes open, she looks completely shocked
to see me.
“Cameron, you're—”
“I love you.”
The words just fall from my lips. So quickly and so randomly even the
nurse stops what she's doing and looks over her shoulder at me.
I ignore her, stepping farther into the room.
“I love you, Hollis. I'm in love with you. Like really in love with you.
In fact, I think I might love you more than I love hockey.” I take a few more
steps, inching closer to the bed where she's staring up at me with wide,
glassy eyes. “But I don't love you more than our baby, and I hope you can
understand that.”
She tucks her lips together, barely holding back a sob.
I can't take it. I have to touch her.
I rush across the rest of the distance in hurried steps and cradle her face
in my hands. I look into those deep, dark blue eyes I can't get enough of,
the ones I'll never get enough of.
“I just need you to know I love you, okay?”
She nods, and then, I kiss her.
I don't care if I'm not supposed to kiss her right now. I don't care if
she's mad at me.
I have to kiss her. I can't stand here and not kiss her.
Luckily, she kisses me back with just as much fervor.
“You're here,” she says when I pull away, a few tears slipping down her
cheeks. I kiss those too.
“I'm here.”
I kiss her again, and then once more for good measure.
“All right, Dad,” the nurse says, laughing at us. “We need to check
some stuff. Make yourself comfortable over there, all right?”
I move around to the other side of the bed, not letting Hollis' hand go as
the nurse checks her over and makes sure everything is good.
“Well, we're moving along nicely. We're at a four now. We still have
hours to go, so you just rest, all right, Momma?”
Hollis nods, already looking tired.
The nurse promises more people will be in and out, then leaves.
Emilia points to the door. “I'm going to give you two some privacy. Let
me know when I can start playing some Bon Jovi.”
“Bon Jovi?”
“You know, when we're halfway there and livin' on a prayer.” She
winks, then closes the door behind her, leaving Hollis and me alone for the
first time in a week.
I blow out a breath and look over at her. Even a little sweaty and tired
from the contractions, she's fucking stunning.
“Hi,” she whispers quietly.
“Hi.”
Then I just stare because she's here and I'm here and we're having a
damn baby and I can't wrap my head around it.
I don't know how long we sit like that, but it's long enough that day
turns to night and the moonlight shines in through the window directly onto
her. She looks just like she did back in that garden, and I think I loved her
even then.
“I'm sorry,” I tell her, the words tumbling out of me. “I'm so fucking
sorry. I'm an idiot for implying that you would do anything to harm our
baby. I was just…”
“Scared,” she supplies for me, nodding. “I know. I was too. I am too.”
I blow out a breath because it makes me feel better to know she's afraid
of this too. “I didn't plan on this, you know? I've been so against
relationships and love and all the bullshit that goes with them for so long
now. I've been putting hockey first and trying to forget that people have the
ability to break you. But along the way, I forgot there's this whole other side
to love. I forgot all the good parts, the ones that make you feel like you're
on top of the world. I forgot all the parts that make it feel just as good as
lifting a trophy over my head.”
“Not just any trophy—the Super Bowl trophy.”
I glower at her, and she giggles.
I fucking missed that giggle.
She sobers, squeezing my hand. “I know what you mean, Lowell. The
thought of putting myself back out there after my divorce made me want to
puke. Hell, it still makes me want to puke. I thought I'd have more time
before I jumped into another life-altering thing. I thought I'd have time to
figure out what went wrong before, to figure out what I want from life. But
this”—she places her hand on her belly—“this is what I want. It's not what
I planned by a long shot, but I've never been gladder for something to
happen. And I'm glad it was you.”
“I'm glad it's me too. Even if we don't work out together, I'm so glad
my baby will always have you.”
“It's a lucky baby, huh?”
“The luckiest.” I kiss her hand, trying to ignore the way my hands are
definitely shaking right now. “We are totally crazy for this, right?”
“Absolutely insane.”
“That's okay. I've heard crazy is hot.”
I wink, and she laughs.
“Miller?” I nod. “Figures. I can't believe we're here right now.”
“I know.”
“I can't believe you love me.”
“I do.”
“And I can't believe I love you too.”
Her words shouldn't shock me. Not given the circumstances.
But they do.
They shock me because…this?
This is what Smith was talking about all along.
This is what was missing.
Them.
“Okay, wow. That is the cutest little bundle of squish ever.”
Harper coos at the baby tucked safely in her arms. It's the same thing
she's been doing for the last thirty minutes, not letting a single other person
have a chance to hold her.
Hollis finally gave birth just after midnight.
Watching her deliver our child will forever be imprinted on my mind.
Not just because it was completely disgusting—absolutely nobody can deny
that—but because I swear it made me fall even more in love with her
watching her power through that.
“Did you decide on a name yet?” Collin asks, looking over Harper's
shoulder.
They've both been unable to stop staring.
“Miller!” the guy himself says. “It's totally unisex.”
I roll my eyes. “It's not Miller, but we did settle on something. Do you
want to tell them?”
“You can,” Hollis says, looking exhausted but so incredibly beautiful all
at once.
“Freddie Olivia Lowell.”
Harper looks down at her brand-new baby niece. “Freddie. It's perfect.”
They all clamor around her again, looking at the baby differently with
her name.
“It is perfect, you know,” Hollis says, grinning up at me.
“I know. And so are you.” I wink.
“You know we can't have sex for like six weeks, right?”
“I'm aware…”
“So, then, why are you saying so many nice things?”
I lean down, pressing my forehead against hers. “Because I'm in love
with you…darlin'.”
She sighs. “I'll let you get away with it this time, but only because you
gave me a beautiful little girl.”
“Hell of a one-timer, right?”
“The best one-timer of my life.”
“I love you, Hollis.”
“And I love you…Cameron.”
EPILOGUE
Hollis
I was right.
About a month after Freddie was born, my mother packed up my
childhood home, the one that held so many good and bad memories for her,
and moved across the state to be closer to her new granddaughter. She is
obsessed with Freddie.
Honestly, I can't blame her—I'm obsessed too.
If I thought I loved my little girl when she was just a little flutter inside
of me, I was wrong. That love is nothing compared to watching my baby
grow.
It's been nine months since my daughter was born, and I still can't
believe I'm a mother. I can't believe I created and carried a little human and
now I get to watch this baby flourish for the rest of her life.
Freddie laughs from across the room, the sound drawing my attention.
Her tiny arms are outstretched toward her father, and I can't help but smile
as he plucks her from her grandmother's grasp, blowing kisses into her
chubby neck.
“You're so in love with him. It's gross.”
I peek over at my sister, who is watching Lowell with her own grin.
“You're one to talk.” I flick my eyes to her husband, who is standing
next to Lowell, making faces at Freddie. “You're so in love with him.”
“Yeah. I am.” She sighs dreamily. “Can you believe this is where we
are?”
“Not even a little bit.”
“You're a mother.”
“And you're a wife.”
“And soon you're going to be a wife…right?” She lifts her brows in
question like I'm harboring some sort of secret.
I laugh then flash her my hand. “Still ringless.”
She sighs again, only this time it's less wistful and more out of
irritation. “Fool.”
These last two years have been the most tumultuous of my life between
finding my ex-husband cheating on me, divorcing him, getting pregnant by
my one-night stand, and then falling in love with said one-timer. Add in
moving in with Lowell and adjusting to motherhood plus being a prohockey player's girlfriend on top of that, and—yeah, it's been a crazy ride.
But if Lowell were to ask…I'd say yes in a heartbeat.
Much like how I thought I loved Freddie before she was born, if I
thought the love I had for Lowell was strong before our baby came into this
world, I was dead wrong. Watching him become a father has taken my
feelings for him to a whole different level.
I don't think I'll ever forget the first time he had to leave for a road
game after Freddie was born. During the birth? Not a single tear, but
leaving Freddie's side for the first time? He lost it. He cried for ten minutes
before he finally got out the door to catch the flight. His coach reamed him
a new one, but Lowell swears spending those extra minutes with his child
was worth it.
That was the first moment I fell even more in love with him. There have
been about a hundred other moments since then that have made me fall
even harder.
Like the time he got home at two AM after an away game then insisted
on being on nighttime duty with Freddie, who was struggling to sleep
through the night.
When we went for a date night and my boobs started leaking through
my dress, even though he wasn't wearing an undershirt, he took his dress
shirt off so I could cover up. He didn't even care that he had to go shirtless
under his suit jacket throughout the rest of our dinner.
And even now, today, he's been walking around wearing that silly shirt I
bought for him the first Christmas we spent together, not the least bit
embarrassed by the bold WORLD'S HOTTEST HOCKEY DAD letters
across it.
As if he knows we're talking about him, Lowell's eyes find mine, and a
huge grin lights up his face. He stalks toward us, Freddie in his arms. She
reaches out for me, but Harper steps in, stealing her away.
“What? You don't want Mama. You want Auntie Harper! Aunts are way
cooler than moms,” she says, brushing her nose against Freddie's as her
niece laughs and burbles out some nonsense.
“Moms and aunts are cool and all, but uncles are where it's at!” Collin
declares, stealing Freddie from his wife's arms. He plops her down onto her
playmat, dropping to the floor and stacking up blocks as Freddie watches
with giddiness. She knows exactly what's coming.
Harper and Collin are still firmly against having their own children, but
that doesn't mean they aren't complete constants in Freddie's life. The
number of times I've had to beg my sister to spend time with my own child
is a little ridiculous if you ask me. They are both over here at our home
nonstop, stealing away all of Freddie's attention.
“Honorary uncles too,” Rhodes adds, sitting on his knees next to them
and picking Freddie up to recreate a scene from Godzilla as he crashes her
through the blocks.
Harper, Ryan, and my mother all sit back on the couch, laughing as they
take turns playing blocks and monsters with her. It's her favorite game.
There is not a single soul in this room who would ever dare to say
Freddie isn't loved. It's so obvious by the way she's garnered the attention
of each person, including the always grumpy Smith, who is admittedly a
little less grumpy these days.
Lowell slides his arms around my waist, dropping his chin to rest on my
head.
“They're so in love with her,” he says, pressing a kiss to my temple.
“Just like I'm so in love with you.”
“That was incredibly cheesy. Say it again.”
He laughs. “I'm so in love with you.” He drops his lips to my ear and
splays his hand across my still flat stomach. “All three of you.”
I might not be harboring secrets about an engagement, but I am
harboring another one.
I'm pregnant.
We didn't plan it, but we were significantly less shocked this time
around.
“Do you think they'll love the second one as much as the first?” I
whisper to him.
“I don't know how they couldn't. We make cute babies.”
I grin at Freddie, her dark curls bouncing as she giggles with her whole
body. “That we do.”
“Do you think we'll love the baby just as much?”
“Yes. But I have to admit, I'll love you a little less.”
My brows pinch together, and I look up at him. “You will?”
“Yes, but only because I'm going to have to make room in my heart for
another girl. It's nothing personal.”
My heart skips a beat. “I think that's fair, even though there is no way
it's a girl.”
He lifts his brows. “You really want to bet against me on that given my
track record?”
“You had a 50/50 chance of being right. It's not that impressive.”
“No? Well, if you're not impressed with that, let me show you
something that will impress you.” He pushes his hips into me, and there's
no mistaking the feel of his cock against my ass.
“Lowell!” I hiss out. “We have company!”
“Uh, yeah, you do, and I'm going to pretend I didn't just witness all
that.” Emilia waves her hand in our direction as she passes us, plopping
down on the couch between Miller and Smith.
Miller slips his arm across the back of the cushion behind her but
removes it just as fast when he catches sight of the glare Smith is directing
his way.
I tuck my lips together, trying not to laugh.
“Can we send them all home yet?” Lowell asks.
This time I do laugh. Lowell's always been a notoriously private person,
to the point that only like five people on the team even knew where he
lived, but now we have almost a constant rotation of people in and out,
especially on Sundays when we host brunch whenever the Comets are on a
home game stretch.
“They just got here.”
“So? I'm ready to have you alone again.”
“You just had me alone.”
He runs his nose along my neck. “It wasn't enough. But to be fair, it'll
never be enough.”
“I'm sure you'll get tired of me eventually.”
“Not a chance.” He presses a kiss to my neck. “Forever, remember?”
“I remember.”
“Do you? Because if you need a reminder, I will gladly sign a legally
binding agreement to make sure you don't forget. You know, one with like
rings and shit.”
I tip my head up, meeting his green eyes, which are usually so certain
and so confident.
“Did you just propose to me?”
“No. Yes. Kind of?”
“Kind of?”
“I mean…” He runs his tongue along his lips. “Is that… Is that what
you want?”
It doesn't happen often—in fact, I've only seen him like this twice—but
Lowell's nervous.
“Is that what you want?” I echo.
“I asked you first.”
He grins, and I roll my eyes.
He chuckles at that. “Yes. It's what I want.”
“Because I'm pregnant?”
His brows pull together. “No. I… No. Actually, I think I've wanted it
since the moment we met.”
“You wanted to marry me when I punched you?”
“What can I say?” He shrugs. “I like 'em crazy.” He winks. “What do
you say, darlin'? Want to get married?”
“Are you serious?”
“Completely.”
I blink up at him, stunned.
“Don't mess with me…” I warn, narrowing my eyes.
“I would never. I already know you got a mean right hook.”
“Cameron…I'm serious.”
“So am I.”
He steps away from me…and drops right down on one knee. He shoves
his hand into his pocket, producing a gorgeous teardrop ring.
My hand flies to my mouth because I was so not expecting this today.
“I love you, Hollis, more than I've ever loved anyone—aside from
Freddie—in my entire life. Marry me.”
“I…” I glance over at the others, who are all now watching us intently,
monsters and blocks completely forgotten. I look back down at Lowell, who
is grinning up at me with a smirk that is just entirely too confident.
He knows—because of course he does—that I'm going to say…
“Yes!”
Everyone in the room explodes into a chorus of joy.
Lowell presses a quick kiss to my belly before pushing up to his feet,
swooping me into his arms, and peppering me with kisses.
“Have you been planning this?” I ask him.
“This exact moment? No, but I've had the ring for a while now.”
“How long is a while?”
“Nine months.”
“But that's…”
He's had it since Freddie was born.
“Someone wants to say congrats to Mama and Dada.”
I grab Freddie from Harper, snuggling my baby close. Lowell wraps his
arms around both of us, and I think this may be my favorite moment of ours
yet.
“Ma…ma.”
I gasp, tears welling in my eyes. “Oh my gosh! She said Mama!”
“Now say dada.” Lowell tries to coax it out of her.
“Ma…ma,” Freddie says again, smiling.
“Say dada.”
She just grins up at him.
“Ha! Mama wins. Mama's the favorite,” I taunt.
“That's okay, little darlin',” Lowell says, kissing her head but keeping
his eyes on mine so I can see the pure love swimming in his eyes. “Mama's
my favorite too.”
I lied.
This is my favorite moment of ours.

EMILIA
“Wicked Witch incoming in five minutes!”
I shake my head at the announcement that comes from my co-workers
every morning.
Really, as a manager, I should discourage that kind of talk, but…it's
true. Tori Witt, our media relations director, emulates Wicked Witch vibes.
To say she's all business and no fun would be an understatement. Last year,
when we crushed our social media number goals, she ordered six donuts
and left out a sheet of gold stars next to them in the break room.
There are over ten employees on the social media staff alone. It was
beyond insulting to all our hard work.
“I can't wait for the day when you're the director of the department,”
Blake, my co-worker, says, bumping his shoulder into mine.
“Me? Please. Like that will happen.”
I mean, I'd love for it to happen, but I'm not holding my breath. They'd
have to pry the job of director from Tori's cold, dead hands.
“I don't know…I heard a rumor…”
I roll my eyes. “People need to stop spreading rumors. Look what
happened to Jane—she got fired because of rumors.”
“Oh, no,” Courtney says, handing me a piece of paper. “That one was
true. We even have a new policy about it.”
“Seriously?” I take the paper from Courtney's outstretched hand, mouth
slackened.
She nods. “Yep. They even bolded it.”
I glance at the sheet in my hand to see if it's true.
And it is. Right there in giant, bold print.
ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS WITH PLAYERS ARE PROHIBITED
AND WILL RESULT IN IMMEDIATE TERMINATION.
“They dated, but he broke it off and she was upset. To get revenge, she tried
to sue for sexual misconduct, saying the player came on to her, but he had a
whole slew of texts that showed it was just the opposite. So now it's not just
discouraged—it's prohibited.” She shrugs. “So, much to everyone's chagrin
because those guys are hot, no sleeping with the players.”
I swallow back the lump that's formed in my throat.
Immediate termination.
“You don't have to worry about that from her,” Blake says. “She's on
her way to director. There's no way she'll mess that shot up.”
“What? You are? Does that mean the rumor about Tori is true? I—”
“Emilia! Blake! My office now!”
Tori's sharp words cut off whatever Courtney was going to say, and I
glance over at Blake, whose brows are raised, just as shocked by Tori's
interruption.
“Uh-oh,” he says, setting his empty mug down. “Guess we're in
trouble.”
I press a hand over my stomach, trying to quell the nausea rolling
through me as I look down at the paper in my hands because…does she
know?
My face must show my worry because Blake laughs.
“I was teasing. Come on. We'll grab coffee afterward.”
I give a polite laugh and follow him from the break room, spending the
entire way there trying not to freak out over how serious Tori sounded when
she blazed through the floor.
We slip into her office, close the door, and take the seats in front of her
desk. She's sitting behind it looking every bit the director that she is. She's
a small woman, a few inches shorter than me, but she can command a room
like nobody's business. If I wasn't so terrified of her, I'd be in awe.
She stares at us down her nose, clacking her long nails against the top of
her desk.
Clack.
Clack.
Clack.
Then finally, she speaks.
“I'm quitting.”
I sit up straighter in my chair, leaning forward because maybe I didn't
hear that correctly.
“You're quitting?” I ask, just to make sure, because there is no way she
just said what I think she did.
Tori nods, her pin-straight, short dark bob bouncing. “Yes.”
“Are you insane?” The words fly out of my mouth before I can stop
them.
There's a sucked-in breath from next to me, and I can't say I blame
Blake for his surprise.
I'm surprised.
Tori is a notorious hard-ass. In the two and a half years I've been
working with the Comets, I'm certain I've only seen her smile twice, and
once was when the team won the Stanley Cup, which doesn't really count.
Smiles are contagious then.
Sitting here, watching her throwing her head back and laughing, is
alarming. I won't lie and say I'm not shaking on the inside right now,
waiting for her to explode on me.
“No, not insane,” she says with a grin. “Just pregnant. So maybe a little
insane, then, given my age.”
My eyes widen because I had no idea Tori was expecting. I would have
never guessed she even wanted children considering her disdain toward any
event involving them.
“Is there something in the air?”
Again, my mouth betrays me, the words tumbling free without warning.
Blake bumps his knee against mine—hard.
Tori tips her head. “Pardon?”
I wave my hand. “Nothing. Just…a lot of babies happening around here
is all.”
“Ah.” She purses her lips, nodding. “I assume you mean Mr. Lowell.
We did send him and his…well, whatever she is to him, a card, yes?” She
flicks her wrist, not caring if we sent something or not to the team's captain.
She does it to save face, not because she truly cares about the players or
their families.
I want to tell her Lowell's “whatever” has a name. It's Hollis, and she's
been my best friend since first grade. But I'm sure with my insubordinate
outbursts so far this morning, that likely wouldn't go over too well.
“Yes, we sent Mr. Lowell a congratulations card,” Blake speaks up for
me like the angel he is.
I am so buying him lunch today.
“Good.” Tori folds her hands over her still flat stomach. “I won't be
leaving until after the season ends, but you're my top picks for director. I
wanted you both to know in advance because this second half of the season
is going to be a test run of how well you'll handle this department in my
absence. It will let me know if I can recommend one of you for the position
without worrying about you ruining all my hard work, or if I need to look at
outside sources to take over.”
“A test run?”
Ugh. Why do I keep asking stupid questions?
And why does Tori let me keep asking stupid questions? Usually, she'd
be reaming me a new one. Perhaps it's her pregnancy. Maybe she's turning
a new kinder, gentler leaf.
“Yes, a test run. Nepotism may have gotten you this position, Emilia,
but your talent is what's kept you here. I need to see if you're capable of
continuing that without my guidance.”
Ah, there it is—the dig.
It's true I got this job because of my uncle, but it's also true that I've
worked my ass off to keep it. I'm a damn good social media manager. I
work harder than anyone else in the department, come up with excellent
content, and help keep a team of skilled members on task. Blake and I kick
ass at co-managing, and I love this job. Being the social media manager for
an NHL team is exactly what I want to do. Funny considering a few years
ago, I couldn't even tell you anything about the game of hockey, but here I
am loving every minute of it. I think I'm as in love with the game as I am
with my job, and that's saying something.
Becoming the director of all media relations with an NHL team would
be a dream come true. A dream I never knew I had, to be honest. Not until I
got here.
Now, I want more. I'm ready for more.
I want that director position, and I want it bad.
“I am,” I tell her. “I'm ready.”
“It's going to mean longer hours, more time away from your family.”
Her eyes flick to Blake because we both know that's who she's talking to.
Blake has a doting husband and a daughter.
Me? I don't have anyone, and everyone knows it. I'm alone, which is
why I'm perfect for this job. I have plenty of time to devote to it.
“I understand,” I tell her.
“Good,” Tori says, sounding unconvinced. “As we start to prepare for
another playoff run after Christmas, I'd like to do another player profile like
we did last season.” By we, she means the series Blake and I produced and
she had zero involvement in. “The fans responded well to it, and I believe
that's what drove our social media numbers up across the board in the last
half of the season. I want to do that again. In fact, I want to double our
numbers.”
Double? Sure, we gained a lot of exposure last year with the profile we
did on one of our most beloved players and his picture-perfect family, but to
double that? We'd need a damn good piece…and possibly a miracle.
“I'd be happy to gather a list of potential subjects. I—”
“They want Smith,” she states definitively.
It's three simple words, yet they are all it takes to make the hairs on the
back of my neck stand straight up. A chill runs down my spine, and I pray
nobody notices my reaction.
I run my tongue along my rapidly drying lips. “Owen Smith?”
Her shrewd eyes narrow just a smidge, and I can tell the thin ice I've
already been walking on has just gotten thinner. “Well, he is the only Smith
on the team, so yes.”
Of course she means him. I was just hoping that, by some miracle,
another Smith was traded to the Comets and I missed it and she wasn't
referring to one of the most underrated centermen in the league.
But nope, she means Smith.
My Smith.
I swallow thickly, and she doesn't miss it.
“Is that an issue?”
“Well, it's just that last year he refused.”
She lifts a perfectly shaped brow. “Your point?”
“I just thought…” My words die when her brow rises even higher.
“Well, don't think. Just act. He's a mystery, and the fans want to know
more about him. So, get him on board before the Christmas break.”
My stomach drops. Not at her words—I am unfortunately used to those
—but at her request.
I don't want to work with Smith more than I already have to, and
working with him for the player profile series will require just that. Last
year when we did it on a defenseman, I got close with not only the player
but his wife too. We followed them the entire season.
Having to spend all my extra time with Smith…I'm not sure I can
handle that.
“We will,” Blake assures her, his knee knocking into mine again.
Kiss-ass.
But he's not. He's just telling Tori the truth that I can't handle. We will
get Smith on board. We have to if we want this promotion.
And that sucks for so many reasons.
Tori focuses her attention on the pile of papers on her desk, and Blake
and I are both aware that it means we're dismissed. We rise to our feet, our
eyes connecting in a silent conversation of What the fuck just happened?
Tori doesn't speak until Blake's hand hits the door handle, and we both
pause to look back at her.
“I trust you're both aware of what being a director means, yes?”
“Um…yes?”
She sighs, sitting back in her chair. “It means you're the media relations
face of the team. It means you're the one who is setting the example. That
sheet being passed around out there”—she nods toward the office—“means
something different for you, something more. You'll do well to remember
that if you want a thriving chance.”
Blake and I exchange another glance, then nod frantically.
Tori looks away again, and we scurry from the office, both running
scared.
“Are you insane?” Blake hisses the moment we're down the hall and
safe from Tori. “I can't believe you kept asking her to repeat herself!”
“I was shocked!” I argue back in a hushed tone. “I didn't think she'd
ever quit. She gets off too much on being hateful to us all.”
Blake cracks a smile. “That's fair. But that was the rumor I was going to
tell you about.” He shakes his head. “Good gravy, Em—I thought she was
going to crawl over her desk and strangle you, and that would have sucked
because I'm not sure I would have helped. I have a kid, and kids are
expensive. I need this job.”
“Gee, thanks,” I mutter, pushing past him toward the state-of-the-art
coffee machine we have. I press a button for a double espresso with
steamed almond milk, then rest against the counter.
Blake settles in next to me. “Speaking of my job…you know I don't
want that promotion, right?”
I nod because I kind of figured. It's demanding, and he already
complains about missing time with his husband and their new baby. “I
know.”
“But I'll help you with the piece on Smith. Just when the time comes,
the credit is all yours.”
Smith.
The simple mention of his name has my body running hot.
“Hey, don't look so worried. It's going to be great. You're going to get
the promotion. We'll make sure of it.”
He doesn't understand. Not getting the promotion isn't what I'm
worried about. I'm an amazing manager. I deserve this promotion.
What I'm worried about is working with Smith. Because that new rule
about not sleeping with the players?
I already broke it.

EMILIA
Two & a half years ago
You know when you've had a long day at work and everything that could
have gone wrong did, and all you want to do is go home, take off your
pants, pour a glass of wine, and order a pizza?
That was all I wanted: pants off, wine poured, pizza delivered, in that
order.
I definitely did not want to open my apartment door and find my
boyfriend of three years plowing the single mom who lives next door.
And if that wasn't enough…the baby she's been taking care of by
herself for the last year?
His.
That means practically from the moment we moved in together, he was
sneaking around with her.
I'm a fool for not seeing it before now. All those times he went over
there to help her fix something in her apartment? I thought he was simply
being a good neighbor. I had no idea he was busy falling for her.
When he helped build the crib for her baby? I thought he felt bad that
the dad wasn't around. I had no idea he was assembling furniture for his
own child.
The worst part of it all? I liked her. I babysat for her! I helped buy
diapers for her.
I am such an idiot.
The Dick Who Shall Not Be Named offered to let me have the
apartment, but I couldn't stand the thought of living next door to them.
The whole thing felt like a sign, like it was finally time to move on from
the small-town life and get out from under the boss I hated so much. So
with the small savings I had in my bank account, I quit my job and moved
to Bartlett. With a good word from my uncle, I was able to secure a social
media manager position that gave me a very nice pay raise.
That's what I'm doing here tonight at some place called Slapshots—I'm
celebrating.
By myself.
Because I left all my friends behind too, including my best friend,
Hollis. So, that's why I'm currently sitting at the bar alone on a Friday
night.
Whatever. At least I'm not sitting at home crying into my pint of Ben &
Jerry's like I have for the last two weeks.
I take a sip of my whiskey sour and glance around. There are several
smaller groups dispersed throughout the space as well as a large crowd
around the other end of the bar. The music is loud, but not so loud you'd
have to yell to talk to someone.
Not like I'm talking to anyone anyway.
I let out a long sigh. Maybe I should just head home. I'll lie and tell
Hollis I stayed the whole time. She'll never know the difference.
My cell phone buzzes against the bar top.
Hollis: Don't you dare think about leaving.
I gasp, looking around, half expecting her to be in the bar somewhere.
Hollis: And before you freak out, no, I'm not hiding in the
corner. I just know you, Em.
Me: I was totally thinking of bailing.
Hollis: I know you were.
Hollis: Just stick it out. Even if you don't meet anyone, you
can say you did it, and that will make next time easier.
Me: NEXT TIME?!
Hollis: Yes, next time. You're going to have to meet new
people somehow.
Me: Can't I just wait until I start work next week?
Hollis: And do what in the meantime? Wallow in your new
apartment? Not happening. If I were there (and I know, I
know, I'M NOT), you know we'd be out on the town right now,
prowling around the bars trying to get you laid.
Hollis: So that's what I want you to do. Prowl. Get laid. Forget
about TDWSNBN (I motion to shorten that to just The Dick).
Find someone who will rock your world for one night (maybe
two if you're lucky) and be the badass bitch you are.
Hollis: Find a new dick to replace the old one.
I know she's right. I could easily spend another night buried in ice cream
and watching movies that make me sob, but why waste the empty calories
and energy on a man who didn't love me? I don't need to treat myself like
crap just because he did.
The sooner I realize that, the sooner I can get back to being me.
Me: Motion approved.
Me: And you win. I'll stay.
Hollis: There's my girl!
Hollis: Now, push your shoulders back, lift that chin, and…
wait, is there anyone sitting next to you?
Me: There's a girl on one side (gorgeous but I'm not into
chicks) and the other seat is empty.
Hollis: Good. You're going to flirt with the next guy who sits
next to you.
Me: The very next one?
Hollis: Yep. No exceptions. If he's not your type, consider it
practice.
Me: Okay. I can do that.
Hollis: YOU GOT THIS!
Hollis: And if you do go home with anyone…
Me: Turn on Find My Friends. I know, Mom.
Hollis: Love you.
Me: Love you more.
I set my phone back down on the bar.
That's when I notice someone's taken the seat next to mine.
He's not paying a lick of attention to me, his gaze wholly focused on the
empty glass in his hand. He's older, a bit of gray peeking through the dark
hair around his temples and in his beard. His skin is tanned, and there's a
bump to his nose that makes it look like he's broken it a time or two. A scar
cuts through his eyebrow, and I really want to reach out and run my finger
across it.
Even with the imperfection in his brow and the frown pulling those
thick lips down, he's still handsome.
You're going to flirt with the next guy who sits next to you. No
exceptions. If he's not your type, consider it practice.
I take a steadying breath and decide to go for it.
“You know, my mama always told me if a man is frowning that deep, it
means one of two things: he's had his heart broken, or his dick don't work.”
“Excuse me?”
“I'm just repeating what she said is all.”
I turn toward him and nearly gasp when I gaze into his amber eyes.
Oh…this man? He is definitely my type.
I don't even bother to try to hide my attraction to him, letting my tongue
roll over my now drying lips.
“Though I'm going to guess it's not the latter.”
He raises a dark brow. “That so?”
“Yep.” I stick my hand out toward him, hoping it's not clammy because
what the hell am I doing? I push the insecurities away and say, “Emilia.
And you are?”
He glances down at my outstretched hand like he's not sure if he should
shake it or not. When he finally slides his palm against mine, I have to fight
the shiver trying to work its way down my back.
“Smith.”

SMITH
“Dude, you look like you're trying to take a shit.” A finger is pressed into
my eyebrow, right into the scar I got when I was twenty-six. “Stop
frowning. You're going to get more wrinkles, old man.”
“Stop touching me, rookie.” I smack his hand away and glare over at the
obnoxious idiot sitting next to me.
His eyes narrow and he puffs his chest out indignantly. “I'm not a
rookie anymore.”
Fine, so Miller, a right-winger who has some of the slickest mitts in the
league, has been with the Carolina Comets for a few years and is not
technically a rookie, but he sure as shit still acts like one.
Can't say I blame him though. I did the same stupid stuff he's doing at
his age. Going out partying, always a different woman on my arm—it's
almost like a rite of passage in the NHL.
But I'm thirty-eight and too old for that crap.
“Compared to me, you just started skating yesterday.”
He snorts. “I'm pretty sure compared to you, just about everyone in this
league just started skating yesterday, Apple.”
Apple. It's a nickname I both love and hate.
I love it because it represents my ability to set up my teammates on
plays and earn a top spot in NHL history with the number of assists I've
racked up over the years.
But I also hate it because it's a reminder of the years that are stacking up
against me because it's not just Apple for assists. It's for Granny Smith
Apple. They're calling me old, as if I don't fucking know it.
That sinking feeling of losing the game I love slips into my gut again.
No matter how many times I try to shove it away, it slithers back in. The
expiration of my contract with the Comets is creeping closer and closer. By
the end of this season, I'll be an unrestricted free agent, and because of my
age, it's a real possibility that the team won't sign me again.
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't scared that my time in the NHL is coming
to an end, which means my chances of hoisting that Cup again are
dwindling by the day. I don't know how to face either of those realities.
I'm lucky; I know that. Making it to the NHL and sticking around,
especially as long as I have? It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Hoisting
the Stanley Cup? Un-fucking-likely.
Having done it once, though, I want to do it again, and I want it bad.
This is exactly why I can't afford any distractions this year. Hockey is
my sole focus. It's the only thing that matters, the only thing that has ever
mattered. And if I'm being completely honest, it's probably mattered a little
too much sometimes. I've put all my time into the game. There's no way
I'm going away without a fair fight.
“Seriously, man, what's with the shit look? You're supposed to be
jazzed. We're playing hockey!”
Miller bumps his shoulder against mine, and I hate to admit it, but his
smile is downright infectious.
We're on a five-game homestand, and so far, we've won every game.
We have just two more to go before the short Christmas break, and then
we're on a sprint for the playoffs. There is nothing like playing in front of a
home crowd, especially when you're winning. The roar of your number one
supporters cheering and clapping for you to win is incomparable. I much
prefer it to being on the road for a multitude of reasons, but it all starts with
the crowd.
“Just trying to stay focused,” I tell him.
He nods. “I get it.”
Except he doesn't. He's young. Barring any injury, he has many, many
years ahead of him. Me? I know it's just a matter of time before I'm passed
to another team for a yearlong contract…or not offered one at all.
I know some players are cool about it—anything to keep playing, right?
—but I don't want that. I'd rather bow out with a team I love than play for
one where my heart just isn't in it. I've watched too many good men fall to
the wayside and have all their accomplishments turn to dust because they
went out with a team where they weren't appreciated for the skilled player
they were.
I refuse to let that happen to me. I don't want to be a forgotten great.
“Give the old man a rest, Miller,” our goalie says. “Wheel of Fortune
just ended. It's past his bedtime.”
I glare at the smartass little shithead. He just started with the team at the
end of last year, and frankly, he's a prick. Too fucking big for his pads,
that's for damn sure.
But he's good. Really fucking good. Probably the best chance we have
at winning the Cup this year. We didn't go down because of bad
goaltending last year, that's for sure.
“I don't need you coming to my rescue, Greer.”
He scoffs. “I think the words you're looking for are Thank you.”
I stare holes into his back as he shoves off of the bench, all his gear on
and ready to go, then heads out to the hallway to join the other guys.
“Damn.” Miller whistles lowly. “That guy is something.”
I don't tell him he's also something, just a different kind.
Miller rises, then claps me on the shoulder. “See you out there.”
I'm the last one out of the dressing room. Always am and always will
be. It's my thing. Not a superstition, just a comforting sort of habit. I like to
take a moment to clear my head with nobody around.
So that's what I do. I breathe in, then out. In and out.
Rinse, repeat.
And I'm almost to that state of calm I like to enter just before a game
when I hear a clicking sound, then a muttered, “Shit.”
I whip my head up to find the one person I didn't want to see before the
game, the one person I need to avoid if I'm going to have a distraction-free
season.
“Sorry,” she says quietly, that sweet voice of hers all too familiar to my
ears. She wrings her hands in front of her, looking uncomfortable being
alone with me. “I, uh, didn't mean to interrupt. I thought the room was
empty.” She lifts her phone. “Need to shoot some content.”
“Your uncle send you back here?”
I don't know why there's venom lacing my words.
No…that's a lie. I know exactly why—she's the epitome of everything I
want but can't have, and I fucking hate it.
The discomfort in her gaze is gone, and in its place is a glower that
would make lesser men cower. “I don't need permission.”
I try not to react to that because we both know she loves waiting for
permission from me.
She steps farther into the room and begins snapping photos of some of
the gear, ignoring me the entire time. I assume it's for some social media
thing she has going on.
I know I shouldn't be sitting here staring at her, not when I have a game
to go play and especially not when I can hear my teammates in the hallway
going through their pregame routines, getting ready to head down the
tunnel.
But I do it anyway.
I trail my eyes from her long, toned legs over one of those hip-hugging
skirts I swear are the only thing she owns, past her blouse that's unbuttoned
just enough for me to see the swells of her breasts to the perfect pout of her
full lips, which are currently trapped between her teeth as she concentrates
on the task at hand.
She's gorgeous, and that's a problem.
It's a problem because I know what she feels like…what she tastes like.
Over two and a half years have passed since I've touched her, but
somehow it feels like just yesterday, and my desire to do it again hasn't
waned no matter how hard I've tried to stay away from her.
She inches closer to me. I'm not even sure she realizes she's doing it,
but I sure as fuck do. The scent of fresh vanilla and lavender wafts toward
me with every step she takes, and I'd be a damn liar if I said I didn't want to
reach out and touch her.
But I can't.
I really fucking can't.
I shake my head and rise from the bench, needing to get out there for
the game before I get my ass chewed or do something I know I'll regret.
The second I stand, she whirls around and realizes just how close she is.
She takes a tentative step back, and I don't blame her since I'm over six
foot eight with my skates on. That doesn't mean I like it.
I match her step back with one of my own. She gulps, tipping her head
back, all that gorgeous red hair of hers hanging down her back as she stares
up at me with wide eyes.
That hair that looks good wrapped around my fist…
Those eyes that kill me…
I take another step toward her.
“S-Smith…”
But that's all she's able to say.
“Hey, there you are.” Blake, one of the other social media managers,
strolls into the room, not realizing what he just interrupted.
Really, I should thank him, because he just stopped me from doing
something monumentally stupid that we agreed we'd never do again.
“Smith, you're just the man we're looking for. Did Emilia ask you about
the player profile?”
I slide my eyes to Emilia, who looks like she wants to murder Blake
right now. I kind of want to murder him too, but for different reasons.
I am not doing a player profile.
For one, I don't need people all up in my business. For two, I don't want
to do it. I have more important shit to focus on than someone with a camera
following me around trying to get a behind-the-scenes look into the life of a
pro hockey player.
“Blake!” Emilia hisses, but he ignores her.
“Please tell me you're in,” he says to me. “Because the fans voted, and
they want you.”
Last year they did a piece on one of our defensemen and his family. I
know the fans ate it up, but I figured that was because you got to see it all—
the wife, the kids…how he balances everything.
“They want me?”
He laughs, probably at how absolutely fucking shocked I am. “Yeah.
Guess that whole quiet, brooding thing you have going on makes them
curious.”
Curious? I think he means nosy as fuck.
But I guess I get it to some extent, not being in the industry and being
curious about how it all works. I'd probably be dying to know what it's like
to play in the NHL too if I wasn't here.
But why me? Of all the players on our team, why pick me? I'm boring
as shit. Old compared to the other guys. Single with no sordid past. I don't
have a family, and my only friends are on the team.
So again…why me?
I look at Emilia, and to my surprise, she doesn't flinch under my heated
stare.
Was this her doing? Because this definitely violates the whole ignore
one another and pretend it never happened agreement we have.
As much as I'd like a repeat of our weekend together, it's not going to
happen.
It can't happen.
She is off-limits for so many reasons, and that's exactly why I'm going
to stay away from whatever little project they want to try to rope me into.
“So, what do you say?” Blake asks, his blinding white smile pulling my
attention from Emilia to him. “You game to let us follow you around for a
bit, get some footage?”
“No.”
His smile slips just a bit like he really thought he was going to get me to
agree with just a grin. “Not even for the fans?”
“No. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a game to win.”
Blake's jaw drops and he looks like he wants to say more, but I don't
want to hear it.
I turn on my skates and head for the tunnel, but not before taking one
last glance back at Emilia. She looks disappointed, but that's okay. I'm
disappointed in myself too.
Because despite all the reasons I shouldn't, I still want her.

SMITH
Two & a half years ago
“You know, my mama always told me if a man is frowning that deep, it
means one of two things: he's had his heart broken, or his dick don't work.”
I glance over at the woman sitting next to me, two elbows laid on the
bar top. She's stirring what looks to be a whiskey sour with one hand, and
the other is fingering the small hoops lining her ear as if she didn't just
accuse me of not having a working cock.
She's wearing an olive-green tank top and a pair of jeans that, if she
were standing, I'm sure would be molded to her body. There's a mess of
deep red hair pulled into a ponytail that hangs almost midway down her
back. It's the kind of hair that would look damn good wrapped around my
fist as I fed her my cock.
I give myself a shake.
I shouldn't be thinking those kinds of things about women I don't know.
“Excuse me?”
“I'm just repeating what she said is all.” She lifts a pale, freckled
shoulder, swiveling toward me on her stool, her bright green eyes startling
me. Her gaze travels down my body, tongue poking out to roll across her
bottom lip, liking what she sees. “Though I'm going to guess it's not the
latter.”
There's no hint of recognition on her face, but there is one thing that's
abundantly clear—she's on the hunt.
And I just might be willing to get caught.
She's young, too damn young for me. I likely have at least ten years on
her, and I don't have any business fooling around with someone like her.
But I can't seem to stop myself, especially not when she's looking at me
like that.
“Smith,” I say after she introduces herself, sliding my palm against hers,
rubbing my thumb across the back of her hand. I lean into her, our hands
still clasped. She doesn't back away. Instead, she scoots closer. “And I can
assure you, Emilia, that my dick works just fine.”
Her nostrils flare when I say her name. “Good to know.”
“Is it?”
She nods, settling back on her stool. She lifts her drink to her mouth and
runs her tongue around her straw, keeping her eyes on me the entire time.
Oh, I was right. She is on the hunt, and she's marked me as her prey.
That's fine. I'll play along.
“So, Emilia, do you come here often?”
“So cheesy.” She shakes her head, finishing off her drink. “And no. This
is my first time. I'm new in town—just moved here.”
“You know, you probably shouldn't tell strangers you're new in town. If
I were a lesser man, that would be an invitation.”
“An invitation for what?”
“To do bad things to you.”
She leans into me again. “What if I want you to do bad things to me?”
Now it's me whose nostrils are flaring, her words going straight to my
—working just fine, thank you very much—dick.
“You're playing a dangerous game.”
“Hmmm,” she purrs, rolling her tongue over her lips again, knowing
exactly what she's doing. “Is it dangerous if I want it?”
Rod chooses that exact moment to appear, dropping my Jim and Coke
in front of me, breaking our spell.
He looks at Emilia, silently asking if she wants another drink.
“She'll take another,” I answer for her.
Miller's beer is going to have to wait because there's no way I'm
walking away from her right now.
A grin pulls at her plump lips, then she turns to Rod. “Whiskey sour,
please.”
He nods and turns to make her drink.
“So, new-to-town Emilia, what brings you all the way out here?”
There's a shift in her demeanor, her shoulders slumping just an inch or
so, and the spark that was filling her vibrant green eyes has dulled.
Rod sets a new drink in front of her and disappears. Her fingers
immediately find the straw, like she's searching for something to do with
them.
“I…um…I needed a change of scenery.”
“Ah. So you're just getting out of a bad relationship.”
She laughs, then draws a long pull from her drink. “Is it that obvious?”
I shrug. “I'm just good at reading people.”
It's a skill acquired from so much time on the ice—another reason the
Cup loss sucks so bad. I should have read the other team better than I did,
should have seen the play coming, but I didn't, and we lost because of it.
But I don't want to dwell on that now, not when I have such a beautiful
woman sitting in front of me.
“What happened?” I ask.
She lets out a long, sad sigh. “The usual. Girl loves boy, boy says he
loves girl, they move in together. You think things are fine, maybe even
heading toward marriage. All the while he starts sleeping with the girl next
door, fathers a child with her, and you don't find out until you find him
plowing her on the coffee table.” She snorts. “How they didn't break that
thing is beyond me. That man's go-to move is the jackhammer—and he's
not good at it.”
“Wait—he had a baby with her?”
“Yep.”
“And continued a relationship with you like it was nothing?”
“Yep. He said it was my fault because I was never home. Said if I had
just tried harder in bed, he wouldn't have stepped out, and I should have
been there for him more.”
“And he's still breathing?”
“Unfortunately.” She winces. “I shouldn't have said that. That was
uncalled for.”
The fact that she can find compassion for him after what he did…it does
something funny to me that I can't quite explain. She's a good person.
Better than me, that's for sure. I'd have beat his face to a bloody pulp and
still not let up.
What kind of sad sack of shit does that? Who the fuck says those things
to someone?
The smile that was lighting her face when she was flirting with me is
gone, replaced by a frown that could rival mine. I want to see her smile
again.
“Is that why you're here tonight? Trying to get over him?”
She nods, that hair of hers that I'm dying to unbind bouncing with the
movement. “I promised my friend I wouldn't sit on the couch and wallow
over The Dick anymore.”
“The Dick?”
“That's what we're calling him. Hollis says he doesn't deserve to be
named.”
“Hm. I agree.”
“What are you doing here? You were frowning an awful lot when you
sat down.”
“The same thing you are—trying to get over a heartbreak.”
It's not entirely dishonest. I did get my heart broken. It wasn't a girl, but
another kind of mistress—the game of hockey.
“Well, look at us.” She stirs her drink again, her frown deepening. “Two
peas, one pod and all that.”
A silence falls over us, though it's not an awkward one. It's more of us
both acknowledging what's happening here, the inevitable ending of
tonight.
Right on cue, she turns to me, that grin back in place. “Want to get out
of here, Smith?”
So, we do.
I usher her out of the bar, pulling out my phone to grab an Uber. The car
arrives quickly, and we climb into the back. With one arm slung across the
back seat of the SUV, I slip my phone into my pocket, watching as Emilia
taps away at her own screen. Her hair is brushing against my arm, and I'm
sure it makes me absolutely deranged to say the slight contact is making my
dick throb.
It's been too long since I've taken a woman home, too long since I've
felt this sense of urgency, too fucking long since I've let myself go.
“I can feel you staring at me,” she says quietly.
“Are you telling someone where we're going?”
“Yes.”
“Good girl.”
She swallows at my words, and I don't miss the way her thighs clench
together.
“But I'm not worried.” She slides her phone into the small crossbody
purse she's carrying. “Not with you.”
Unable to stop myself, I let my fingers tangle in her hair, grabbing a few
strands. Her lips part when I give them a gentle tug. I wonder what she'd do
if I wrapped them around my fist like I really want to. Would she moan?
Would she beg me to stop? To pull harder?
“Why's that?” I ask.
“Because something tells me I don't need to worry with you.”
I want to scold her for putting her trust in a stranger so blindly. I should
tell the driver to turn around so I can take her back to the bar where she's
safe. I should do a lot of things, but what I definitely shouldn't do is yank
her close to me and cover her mouth with mine.
I do it anyway…and she lets me.
I have a feeling what we're about to do is going to ruin me.

EMILIA
I knew getting Smith on board would be hard, but I didn't realize it would
be this hard.
“Okay, is it just me, or is he grumpier than usual?” Blake shakes his
head, staring after the player in question. “Sheesh. Guy needs to get laid or
something.”
“Blake!” I glance around the room, making sure nobody heard him. It's
pointless. It's just the two of us in here, just like it was me and Smith alone
in here.
It was dangerous being alone with him. I know that. The minute I saw
him, I should have left.
But I didn't. I tempted fate, even though I know I shouldn't.
For starters, he's more than ten years older than me, and we are in two
different places in our lives. I'm just getting settled in a career I plan to stay
in for many years to come. His NHL career is likely coming to an end any
time now.
Secondly, he's my uncle's player.
And finally, there's that pesky little rule about not having relationships
with the players. He's off-limits…even if I've already had him.
“What?” He shrugs. “It's true. He's always been a grump, but damn,
that was probably the worst I've seen so far. That's saying something
because we also work with Adrian Rhodes.”
I can't help but laugh because he's right—Adrian “Beast” Rhodes is a
notorious grump. He's even worse than Smith on a good day, but I can't
exactly say I blame the guy. He has a long, nasty scar along his face from a
hockey injury many moons ago, and it draws a lot of unwanted attention.
Being a grump is his defense mechanism.
“You think maybe if you ask him nicely, he'll say yes?” Blake suggests
as I continue snapping photos of the equipment. We're doing a before-andafter, behind-the-scenes look at the dressing room on our Instagram, and I
wanted to get these taken quickly so I can get out there and watch the game.
“How would me asking him change anything?”
“I don't know. He seems to like you more than he likes me. He's always
scowling at me.”
“He's always scowling at everyone.”
“Except you.”
I pause at his words but quickly brush them away. He has no idea what
he's talking about. Smith doesn't look at me any differently than anybody
else.
I don't acknowledge Blake's accusation. Instead, I snap one last photo,
then turn his way. “I think we have everything we need for now. Let's go
watch the game.”
He narrows his eyes for only a moment, looking every bit like he wants
to say something else but decides against it. That brilliant smile of his lights
back up.
“You want me to go watch hot hockey players fly around the ice? Count
me in.”
The Comets are already five minutes into the second period when I am
finally able to go downstairs. Usually, whenever I can catch games, I watch
from the upper deck with the other staff members, but tonight Hollis is here
with her younger sister, Harper, who just so happens to be married to Collin
Wright, one of the defensemen.
“Oh, yay! You made it!” Hollis practically squeals as I plop down in the
seat next to her. She wraps her arms around my neck and gives me a tight
squeeze like she hasn't seen me in years even though I just saw her two
days ago.
When I first moved out here from western North Carolina, I was sad.
Not just because of my broken heart, but because I was leaving behind my
best friend, especially since we'd been attached at the hip since first grade.
The last thing I expected was for her to follow me this way just two
years later and end up pregnant by the team's captain.
“How's my baby girl doing?” I ask, placing a hand on her swollen belly.
She doesn't know what she's having yet, but I'm convinced it's a girl.
Lowell knows, but he won't give any indication if I'm right or not.
She laughs. “Of course you'd ask about the baby first.” She covers my
hand with hers, gently giving it a squeeze. “We're good. Someone is just
being a little sassy today.”
“You or the baby?”
“Yes.” She laughs again.
“I hope they got some good shots with Lowell and the bump.”
“Always working.” She taps her finger against the side of my head.
“Shut it off. Enjoy the game.”
“Yes, Mom.” I roll my eyes. “Are you a hockey fan yet?”
She lifts her hand, shaking it back and forth. “Eh.”
“She's here because she's horny and hoping to get laid. I know the
look,” Ryan, Rhodes' wife, says as she bounces her brows up and down.
“Lowell is so getting lucky tonight.”
“Stop it!” Hollis hisses, but she doesn't deny it.
“What? Hockey is hot! It gets everyone's panties wet.”
The pink that fills Hollis' cheeks tells me Ryan is not far off the mark
and that's exactly why she's here tonight. I really can't say I blame either
one of them. There is something insanely attractive about the game. The
sounds, the way their bodies move, all the hot guys smashing against one
another…yeah, I totally get it.
“You're terrible tonight,” Harper tells her friend.
“Just tonight?” Ryan sticks her tongue out before turning back to the
game.
I shake my head with a grin, shifting my attention to the ice just in time
to see Smith jump over the boards and into the action. He slides into the
other team's zone and effortlessly steals a puck, then whips it over to
Rhodes, who tosses it to Wright. Then it's back to Rhodes and back to
Smith again, and once more to Rhodes, who buries it on a one-timer.
The entire arena erupts in cheers, strangers high-fiving and hugging
after the goal. The guys gather along the boards right in front of us, patting
each other on the back and celebrating the first goal of the night.
Rhodes, knowing exactly where his girl is, looks over at Ryan and
winks. It's cute because even though Rhodes is a huge, scarred, scarylooking guy—who is aptly named Beast—he's a softie for his wife.
Rhodes looking in our section pulls Smith's attention, and he glances
our way too. His eyes collide with mine, and I suck in a sharp breath at the
intense look he's shooting my way.
It's not anger. It's not elation. And it's not indifference. Whatever it is…
I don't hate it.
But I'm not sure I like it either.
Our stare is broken when Wright bumps into him. Smith laughs at
whatever he says, and they all skate away, ready to do it again. And they do,
adding two more goals before the period ends, then another two in the third
for good measure.
When there's under five minutes left in the game—which is my cue to
get back to work so we can wrap up all our social media posts for the night
and get home at a decent hour—I head back to the upper deck to find Blake.
He ends his conversation, and we head back to our offices just as
someone scores to make the game six to two.
“Apple, Apple, Apple!” The slow, steady chant leaks out into the halls.
Blake chuckles. “You'd think with the way they're chanting his name,
he'd agree to the video series. They obviously love him.”
They really do, and he loves them too. This is why it sucks so bad to
know the reason he's refusing the player profile is me.
I can't let that happen. There's no reason the fans should suffer because
we can't be mature adults and move past…well, our past. I have to
convince him, not just for my promotion, but for the fans. It's the right thing
to do.
I only hope I can get him to see that too.
“Are you going out to Slapshots tonight?” Blake asks.
“I don't know…” I hedge.
I don't typically go out after games. I'd much rather head home, kick
off my heels, and take a long hot shower because game days are long and
tiring. If I do go out, I avoid Slapshots at all costs. There are too many
hockey players and too many memories wrapped up in the place.
“You bailed last time, and the guys are on a hot streak tonight.
Everyone's going to be there. Even me. Nate's insisting a let loose for a
night.”
I grimace because he's right. If I don't go tonight, my absence will
likely be noticed, which probably isn't good if I'm trying to get a
promotion.
“Come on,” he pleads. “Say yes. Besides, I'm sure Smith will be there.
Good opportunity to corner him for the piece.”
Shit. He has me there. It would be a good chance for me to talk to
him…especially since we'll be in the safety of the public eye. No room for
us to not act like professionals.
“All right. Fine. Count me in.”
After all, I have a player to bribe.
Luckily, by the time we get to Slapshots, the crowd is dwindling. I barely
catch Hollis and Lowell as they're leaving—looking every bit as horny as
Ryan said—and she promises to shoot me a text.
My first stop is the bar because I know I'm going to need a drink to be
able to get through the rest of the night, especially if I'm going to have to
spend any length of time in the presence of Smith and act like I haven't
seen him naked.
I lift my hand toward Rod, the owner of Slapshots, who is always
behind the bar on game nights. I think he loves the thrill of being able to
serve the players himself. He nods, indicating he'll be over in a second,
then heads to help another customer real quick.
I hop up on the stool, settling in because it might be a moment. This
place, even though the crowd has definitely thinned, is still pretty busy. I
glance around, spotting several players all over the bar, each of them broken
off into their little groups, doing their own thing. The other patrons are so
used to seeing them here that they don't even bat a lash or bother them.
Either that or they're well aware that Rod isn't afraid to kick someone out
for bugging them too much.
On my scan of the room, my gaze skates right over a pair of amber eyes
I'm all too familiar with, then jumps right back.
Smith.
His gaze is locked on me, and I swear I can feel his stare raking over my
body as if he were actually touching me. I wonder if he's thinking the same
thing I am—about the last time we were in this bar together.
About the time we met.
About how I'd just moved to the city and went home with a stranger
and spent two days having the most intense sex of my life only to find out
he was a player for the team I'd just signed a contract with.
He has to be thinking about it too. There's no way he's not.
Not with the way he's looking at me.
I'm thankful I have my thick hair swept up in a bun because sweat
breaks out across the back of my neck as he drags his eyes from my crossed
legs, over my simple white blouse, to my face. His stare is so intense it feels
like he's touching every inch of me, which is ridiculous since he's across
the room.
He lifts his drink to his lips, drains the amber liquid, and then rises.
Suddenly he's not safely across the room anymore—he's stalking across
it…and heading for me.
I don't take my eyes from him as he practically glides through the
crowd, his massive six-foot-six frame towering over everybody. His wide
shoulders carve a path as he eats up the distance. He's changed into a pair
of jeans that cling to his legs, showing off his strong thighs, and a simple
dark blue Comets t-shirt with the number twenty-seven displayed on it. His
dark hair is peppered with silver, his beard full but shaped cleanly, and it's
so unfair because he's frustratingly handsome, the kind that forces you to
notice him. It's intoxicating, and I'm buzzed just being in his presence.
He doesn't stop until he's sliding onto the stool next to me.
The moment he sits down, Rod appears. “Another Jim and Coke?” the
owner asks.
Smith nods. “And a whiskey sour with a lime wedge instead of lemon.”
He remembers.
Rod looks over at me and squints. I wonder if he remembers too. If he
does, he doesn't comment, just says a quick “Coming right up” before he
taps the bar twice and turns to make our drinks. He works fast and is sliding
them across the bar top in under two minutes before hurrying off to help
other waiting customers.
I sip eagerly at the sour mix, downing nearly half of it in one go before
finally turning to Smith. I open my mouth to speak, but he beats me to the
punch.
“What are you doing here?”
I snap my mouth shut. Is he serious?
My brows slam tightly together. “Last I checked, this is a free country.
I'm allowed to be here just as much as you are.”
He sighs. “Of course you're allowed to be here, but you're usually not.
So, what are you doing here, Emilia?”
The way my name slides past his lips sends a shiver down my spine. I
think since I've known him, he's only said it a few times, and never as
intimately as he did just now.
When I don't immediately reply, he scoffs. “Let me guess—this is about
the player profile thing?” He takes a sip of his drink, shaking his head.
“You're wasting your time. It's not going to happen.”
“And why not? The fans voted for you. They want that glimpse into
your life. Are you really going to deny them when they give so much to
you?”
“Are you guilt-tripping me?”
“Maybe.”
Yeah, okay, so maybe I am laying it on thick right now, but I kind of
need to. He has to agree to this because I want that promotion bad. If it
means spending more time with Smith—which I really don't want to do—
I'll do it.
I'm not going to let one weekend that happened over two years ago
dictate the rest of my life. We need to move on from it.
“You know I'm right. You owe this to them.”
He narrows his eyes at me. “Do I though? I put my body on the line
every night for their entertainment. Am I really the one who owes them?”
“Yes, getting paid millions to play a game is such a hardship.” I roll my
eyes. “Look, can't you just agree? It won't take much time out of your
schedule, and if it makes you feel more comfortable, I won't be the one
following you around. I can have Blake cover it all. I don't think that'll go
over well for the promotion, but we'll get it figured out in the end.”
“Promotion?” His brows crush together, drawing my eyes to the scar
that cuts through his right one. I never did get the chance to ask him how he
got it, and I really want to know.
I nod. “Yeah. Tori's quitting.”
“Oh, good. That lady scares the shit out of me even.”
I laugh at that, considering how big and scary he is. But that just proves
my point even more—Tori is terrifying, and she's not messing around when
she says she wants Smith for this series. If I can't get him on board, I can
kiss that promotion goodbye.
“So, this is why you want me so desperately? For a promotion?”
I choose to ignore his phrasing and the way it makes me feel. “Yes. It's
my dream job.”
“Funny, I seem to recall that you weren't even sure things were going to
work out here for you.”
I did tell him that back when we first met, and I meant it. I didn't know
if uprooting my whole life was a good idea at the time, but I had to try it.
There was no way I was going to be able to stay in that small town and face
my ex and the woman he fathered a child with while we were together.
“A lot can change in two and a half years.”
“Tell me about it,” he mutters quietly.
We sip our drinks in silence for several minutes. Then several more
minutes, and several more.
I have no idea how long we sit there, but the silence becomes
unbearable, and I can't go another minute sitting in it.
“Are you really going to make me beg, Smith?”
His head whips my way, and I immediately regret my choice of words.
We both know what happened the last time I begged him.
His eyes spark with a darkness I am all too familiar with, a darkness I
yearn to awaken in him again, even though I have no business yearning for
it at all.
I don't know how or when it happened, but we've inched closer to one
another…too close, dangerously so…yet neither of us makes a move to put
space back between us even though we both know we should.
His eyes drop to my lips, then he slowly drags them back up, and the
fire that's blazing in his gaze burns hotter.
“Smith…”
I don't know why I say his name. I'm not exactly sure what it is I even
want.
Do I want him to kiss me?
Do I want to kiss him?
Yes.
The word whispers through my mind, even though it shouldn't, and I
inch closer to him, even though I shouldn't.
“Can I get you another drink?” Rod asks.
We jump apart like we've been caught doing something we shouldn't,
and quite frankly, we have. This bar is full of hockey players and other
members of the staff—how could we be so careless?
Smith nods, and we don't speak until Rod slides fresh drinks in front of
us.
The hockey player tosses his whiskey back, nearly finishing it in one
gulp like he hasn't had a drink in days.
I don't touch mine. I'm not a big drinker, and I'm already feeling
buzzed. I don't know if it's because of the alcohol or Smith. Either way, I
should be careful so I can keep my wits about me.
“I'll do it.”
His words are quiet, but they still cause me to jump, probably because
his voice comes out all scratchy like he hasn't spoken in hours when it's
only been minutes.
“Huh?”
“The player profile…I'll do it.”
“You will?”
He nods. “But I have one condition.”
Of course he does. “Name it.”
“I want you.”
My breath is stolen from my lungs with those three words, and my
thighs clench together of their own accord. “E-Excuse me?”
“I want it to be you,” he amends. “I don't want to have to answer
questions, play silly games, and make ridiculous content and whatever else
with some random person. I want it to be you.”
“Smith…” I say quietly, and that's all I say because he knows what I
mean.
It's a bad idea. Horrible, really. The worst damn idea he's ever had.
But he seems determined. I can see it in his soulful golden eyes.
“Okay,” I relent. “Okay.”
“Good.” He nods. “Good.” He clears his throat. “When do we start?”
I can't help but laugh at how pained the question comes out. “Well, we
won't start filming anything yet, but I'd like to talk about what to expect
with the series since it will last for the rest of the season. Perhaps we can
meet after your morning skate tomorrow?”
He winces but nods again. “That's fine.”
I know I'm asking a lot of him. Smith is a private guy.
“Thank you,” I say softly. “It means a lot to me.”
He glances down, and only then do I realize I've placed my hand on his
arm. I yank it back quickly, like touching him is suddenly burning my skin.
Slowly, he drags his eyes back to mine. “For the fans.”
I swallow. “For the fans.”
Except it doesn't feel like it's for them at all.
This feels like it's for us…when we both know it can't be.

EMILIA
Two & a half years ago
We ride the elevator up to his apartment in silence, much like most of our
drive here was spent.
We don't need to talk. We both know what this is—one night together.
When we reach his floor, his hand falls to the small of my back as he
steers us down the hallway. He doesn't stop touching me, not even when he
slips his key into the door and pushes it open. When we cross the threshold,
I take my first breath in what feels like hours.
I've never gone home with a strange man before. When I met The Dick,
it was through a mutual friend, and we went on five dates before we went
back to his place. Before him, I'd only dated two guys, and neither was
serious.
This…this feels different than anything ever before.
“How old are you?” I blurt out.
“Thirty-six.”
Holy…
“How old are you?”
I wring my hands. “Twenty-six.”
“Christ,” he mutters, and I'm sure he's thinking the same things I am.
He's ten years my senior.
He's too old for me, much more experienced.
And yet, I don't care.
I step toward him, reaching out and fitting my hands around his massive
biceps. “I want this.”
He screws his eyes shut tight like he's warring with himself over this
new revelation.
Just when I think he's about to shove me away and call me a ride, his
hands find my hips, and I hear him mutter, “Screw it.”
Then his mouth is on mine.
The kiss is searing, and I swear I feel it down to my toes. His mouth
ravages me, taking control and kissing me hard. Our tongues tangle
together, and it's wet and hot and everything I could have hoped for.
Before I know it, my back is pressed against a wall, and Smith is right
there, shoving a knee between my legs. One hand cradles my head, the
other digging into my waist, fingers beginning to dip into the waistband of
my jeans.
He trails his lips down my chin, over my neck, nibbling and sucking at
me until he reaches the swell of my breasts. When he realizes my shirt is in
the way, he wastes no time peeling it off before placing me right back
where I was. He buries his face in my chest, kissing at all the exposed skin
before pulling a cup of my bra down.
He doesn't ask. Doesn't hesitate. Just covers my nipple with his mouth
and sucks hard.
He uses his teeth and his tongue to tease until I'm pulling at his hair,
needing him to move or do something else because I need something else.
He catches my drift…and moves directly to my other nipple. He teases me
just the same, pulling me to the edge of frustration before finally popping
free.
With one hand, his eyes on mine, he undoes the button of my jeans, then
slowly peels the zipper down. Just like before, he's touching me without
any preamble.
His hand slides into my jeans and inside my panties. He grazes over my
clit, causing me to moan in pleasure, but he doesn't stop. No—of course he
doesn't. He doesn't quit until he has one finger pumping in and out of my
drenched pussy.
He's not inside me long before he pulls his finger free.
“Oh god,” I cry out. I can't tell if it's from pleasure or the pain of being
so close to the edge and getting backed away yet again.
Then he's pulling my jeans down my legs, only stopping to slide my
shoes from my feet.
I'm standing before him in nothing but my underwear. My tits, swollen
and wet, are hanging out of my bra, and there's an obvious wet spot on my
panties.
“Almost there,” he mutters, stepping into me.
He reaches up and pulls the ponytail holder from my hair, letting my
long, red waves cascade around me. He steps back to admire his work,
palming his hardened length through his jeans.
“Fucking perfect.”
His eyes slowly rake over me, taking in every single inch until I'm
squirming beneath his heated gaze. There's a fire in his eyes burning so hot
I'm certain I'm going down in flames as I stand here.
“Do you like sucking cock, Emilia?” he asks quietly.
I swear my mouth waters at just the thought of it.
I nod, licking my lips.
“On your knees, then.”
I don't argue. I drop to my knees, already knowing I'm going to love the
sting I'll feel on them tomorrow, and watch as he strips his shirt over his
head, then undoes the button on his pants. He drags the zipper down, frees
his cock, and waits.
When I reach forward for him, he shakes his head.
“Put them behind your back.”
I do.
“Good. Now come here.”
I scoot closer, the roughness of the tile edges digging into my skin.
“Open up, Emilia.”
I drop my jaw.
“Good girl.”
He guides his long, thick cock to my mouth, running the head of it back
and forth along my tongue. I can already taste the saltiness of his pre-cum
—and I already want more.
He gathers my hair up with one hand, pulling it tight and tipping my
head back.
“I'm going to fuck your mouth. If at any point you want to stop, just
grab my leg. Understand?”
I nod.
“Use your words, Emilia. I need confirmation.”
“I understand.”
“Good girl,” he says again, and I love the words just as much as before.
He makes good on his promise. He pumps his cock in and out of my
mouth, slowly at first. Then, his movements get bolder…deeper. So deep he
prompts my gag reflex a few times. When I react, he backs off, waiting for
me to tap out.
I never do.
He pushes to the back of my throat over and over again, sometimes
holding himself there, seeing how much I can take. I have no idea how long
we do this for, how long he fucks my mouth, but I love every single second
of it. I just wish I could touch myself; I'm aching so badly, need the release
more than I've ever needed one in my entire life.
Like he can sense it, he pulls off, and we're both gasping for air.
“Need to fuck you,” he says, pulling at my hair, tugging me off the
floor.
He presses me face-first against the wall, pushing my hands flat and
pulling my ass out.
“Don't move.”
I wouldn't dare.
I listen as he rustles around in his jeans, then wait as he rips open the
condom. He grunts as he slides it down his length. I can't see him, but I
hear him move his hand over his cock a few times before I feel the blunt tip
against my entrance.
He leans over me, his lips at my ear. “By the time I'm done with you,
you're going to forget all about him.”
I'm almost embarrassed by the whimper that leaves my lips as he
presses into me slowly.
“Oh shit. You're so fucking perfect,” he whispers, sliding into me inch
by sweet inch.
When he's to the hilt, he pauses, letting me adjust to his size, then he
gently begins rocking into me.
So…damn…slowly.
He pulls out until just the tip of him is inside me, and then he slams
back in. I gasp at the pain that's quickly overtaken by pleasure burning
through my veins.
Smith chuckles, then does it again. And again. He wraps one hand
around my hair, tugging at me until my head falls back and his lips are on
my ear.
“I'm really going to fuck you now, Emilia. Are you ready?”
I nod because it's all I can manage.
He pounds into me again and again and again, so hard and so fast I'm
up on my tiptoes, clawing at the wall, needing a reprieve. I'm torn between
wanting to run away from him and wanting to push back and meet his
thrusts. Something tells me all I need to do is stand right here, letting him
use me.
And fuck, does it feel good to be used like this.
Out of nowhere, my orgasm hits me. It's so hard and intense as stars
explode behind my eyes, and I think I might even stop breathing for a
moment.
Suddenly I'm being spun around, my legs wrapping around his waist,
and I'm thankful for it because I'm not sure I'd be able to stand much
longer. Smith carries me down a dark hall into what I assume is his
bedroom. He drops me onto the bed, then crawls between my legs, wraps
one around his waist, and slides home again.
“Oh!” I cry out when he hits that spot that drives me wild.
He slams into me again, and another whimper leaves me. His thumb
finds my clit and he rubs at it in short, rough circles.
“I can't,” I tell him.
There's no way he's going to make me come again. I have literally
never orgasmed twice during sex.
“You will,” he instructs, leaning down to take my mouth with his.
He slows his pace, kissing me softly and sweetly, a vast contrast to how
he was just fucking me. It doesn't take long until I'm approaching the edge
of that cliff again.
He smiles against me when my hips begin to move on their own,
thrusting up to meet him. “I told you so.”
He pushes back to his knees and looks down at me with a hunger I've
never seen from someone else before. He's looking at me like he can't get
enough, like he'll never get enough.
And I'm not sure I ever will either.
I didn't get a good look at him before, but god, he's perfect. The
moonlight from his open windows casts beautiful shadows across him. His
muscles are tight and defined, his chest full of hair I bet would feel good
beneath my cheek.
His hips snap into mine as he pounds into me. The moment his thumb
finds my clit again, I'm seeing stars for the second time tonight. He laughs
darkly, but it's short-lived as his own orgasm races through him. He stills
above me, looking like absolute perfection with his head thrown back midclimax.
When he finally comes back to earth, he grins down at me and collapses
into a heap beside me. Our breaths are coming in harsh. I have never had
someone fuck me so thoroughly before, never had someone know exactly
what I needed without having to tell them.
I've never wanted to do it again so damn badly.
I hear Smith pull off the condom and toss it into what sounds like an
empty trash can, then he falls back beside me. After several minutes—
during which I'm certain he falls asleep—the panic begins to set in.
I've never done this before. I've never had to deal with the aftermath of
a one-night stand. Do we cuddle? Am I supposed to grab my clothes and
leave? Do I leave my number? I have no idea.
I go to push off the bed, and a giant hand lands on my stomach, halting
my movements.
“I…I should go,” I say quietly.
“Why?”
“Because isn't this just a one-night thing?”
“Yes.”
“Then I should leave.”
He tugs at me, pulling me back to him, and I let him. He rolls until he's
on top of me, staring down at me with those golden-brown eyes as he
stretches my arms above my head, locking his fingers with mine. “Do you
want to leave?”
I tuck my bottom lip between my teeth, contemplating that.
Do I want to leave? No.
Should I leave? Yes.
“You're a lot older than me,” I say.
“I know.”
“And I don't know you.”
“You don't.” He presses a kiss to my nose. “That's all stuff we can
figure out later. We're not discussing it right now. Right now, I'm asking
you…do you want to leave?”
“No.”
“Then stay. We can figure the rest out.”
I chew on my lip again. He leans down, sucking my lip into his mouth,
soothing away the ache I've caused. When he pulls back, he's looking at me
with that same heat I saw earlier.
That same heat I feel pooling in my lower belly once more.
That same heat I'm certain is going to leave burns.
“Stay,” he says again.
And for some crazy reason…I do.

SMITH
I have a few tendencies toward select kinks, but I've never considered
myself a masochist until yesterday. Why the fuck else would I agree to a
player profile and ask that Emilia be the one to do it?
I'm an idiot. There's no arguing that. I just agreed to spend my free time
with the one person I shouldn't be spending any time with. But the way her
bright green eyes lit up when she was talking about the promotion…I
couldn't tell her no. The word was right there on the tip of my tongue, but
instead, it came out I'll do it.
I'm playing with fire; I know that. I just can't seem to stop.
“I heard you got roped into doing the player profile this year.” Rhodes
laughs, shaking his head. “What a fool.”
“Dude, no shit?” Collin says, eyes wide with surprise. “I can't believe
they got you of all people to agree. You're just as private if not worse than
Lowell and Beast over here.” He motions toward Rhodes, who smacks his
glove away.
“Don't say that like it's a bad thing. Not all of us enjoy getting arrested
and having our faces splashed across the media.”
“I didn't enjoy getting arrested.” Collin pauses. “Well, okay, I might
have enjoyed the handcuffs a little, but that's all. Besides, you're one to talk
about drawing media attention, Mr. Get Drunk-Married in Vegas.”
Rhodes scowls at his friend as he skates away to practice his shots, and I
laugh because he's not wrong.
While we normally do tend to keep a lower profile than some of the
teams out there—they have guys with some very public and nasty
relationships—something has definitely been up with the Comets the last
few years between Collin's arrest, Rhodes' very public marriage, and
Lowell getting his one-night stand pregnant.
Collin turns to me. “But seriously, man, how did they convince you to
say yes? I saw all the silly shit they had Woody doing last season. I can't
believe you'd agree to that.”
I try not to groan because I am not looking forward to some of the stuff
they did. Most of it's harmless, like FAQs and fill-in-the-blank type of shit.
What I'm not looking forward to is sitting down and spilling my guts to a
camera for hours, mostly because I'm not sure I'm ready to face the reality
that I have nothing outside of hockey.
“It was voted on by the fans,” I say in way of explanation.
“Shit.”
Shit is right. For the most part, the guys on the team are good about
doing any sort of public event and interacting with the fans, even those of
us who are known for being hard-asses on the ice. We know we owe it to
them, so we suck it up. But to willingly put oneself front and center like
this? It's a fool's gamble.
“How'd they even get your name in the nomination pool?”
It's the same question I've been asking myself, because I sure as hell
didn't sign up for anything.
“Well, about that…” Miller says, coming to a stop behind me.
I glower at him. “Please tell me you're kidding and this wasn't your
doing.”
“I'm kidding?” I take a step toward him, and he holds his hands up.
“Hey, in my defense, I didn't think anybody would actually vote for you.”
He winces. “Okay, fine, so not a lot of people actually voted for you.”
“I don't know if I should be offended by that or not.”
“Definitely offended,” Miller clarifies. “I just figured, you know, you're
old and single and have like zero friends. You need to get out there, live a
little. Maybe one of our single lady fans will hear about your sad excuse for
a love life and take pity and finally get you laid. So I made a bunch of fake
accounts—which is like super easy to do when you have money and can
pay someone to do it for you—and had ‘them' vote for you.”
My glare intensifies, but he doesn't care.
“You can't be mad at me,” he continues. “I saw you and Emilia at
Slapshots last night. It didn't look like you were trying too hard to say no to
her.”
I'm genuinely shocked I didn't see him, because when Miller is
somewhere, you typically know he's there. “You were there?”
He shrugs. “Yeah, I was playing pool in the corner with Greer.” He dips
his head toward the man in the net who blocks the shot from Rhodes
effortlessly, which is damn impressive because Rhodes has a wicked wrist
shot.
“If you wanted to score with the ladies, why didn't you sign yourself
up?” Collin asks Miller.
“I can't be the main event all the time.” Miller grins, but it's not the
same confident expression he usually wears. It's almost like something is
hiding behind it.
Hmm…
“If I knew that hot redhead from the social media department was
spearheading the whole thing, I definitely would have because”—he lets out
a low whistle—“damn.”
My blood simmers hearing him talk about Emilia in any capacity, but it
really starts to boil over when I see how serious he is. I might have no
business fucking around with her, but I don't want Miller going anywhere
near Emilia either.
“Dude, shut the fuck up.” Collin shoves him. “You know that's Coach
Martin's niece, right?”
It's the reminder I need but don't want. Knowing Emilia is our assistant
coach's niece has been the only thing keeping me away. It's wrong on too
many levels, and it's a line I wouldn't be able to uncross.
Collin shoots his eyes across the ice to make sure nobody heard, but
we're in the clear.
“Really? But she's so hot, and he's so…not.”
“Shut up, Miller.” Collin rolls his eyes. “And maybe don't be saying
that shit out loud. There's a strict Don't fuck the staff rule.”
“There is?”
Collin rears his head back, surprised by my question. Hell, I'm surprised
by my question. I shouldn't care because nothing is going to happen
between us.
“Yeah…” He says it slowly, studying me too closely for my liking. “Did
you not read the memo they sent out yesterday?”
“Huh,” I say, turning my attention back to practice. “Must have missed
it since it doesn't apply to me.”
“Right,” he mutters, but he doesn't sound all that convinced.
The truth is, I'm not convinced either.
“Smith!”
My head snaps up upon hearing my name, especially since it's Coach
Martin calling for me. That same feeling of unease that always passes
through me when I have to talk to him hits again. It's been that way for two
and a half years now, and I wonder if I'll ever get used to it.
I skate over to him. “What's up, Coach?”
His gaze is focused on the net where Greer is still working to block
shots. “How's he doing?”
“He's good. Solid. Rebounds could use some cleanup, but good.”
Coach crosses his arms over his chest, eyes still on the ice, watching
people fly around. “And how do you think the team is playing in front of
him? Confident? Stilted? We don't need another Daskin debacle.”
I know he's asking me because I've been with the team the longest and
played in front of the most goalies out of anyone here.
Right now, he's referring to our goalie from about eight years ago, who
was great. We went far because of him. But…the team was also too reliant
on his skills. It might be a goalie's job to stop pucks from going into the net,
but if your team isn't defending its zone, it's not going to matter how damn
good your goalie is.
That year with Daskin…it took us entirely too long to figure that out,
and we bombed the next season after making it all the way to the Cup final
the previous year. It was like we all just lost our ability to gel together.
“I think we could be a little faster on our skates, block a few more
shots,” I tell him honestly. “But mostly solid. As long as we don't get
complacent, I think we'll be good.”
Coach nods. “I think so too.” He taps his elbow against mine. “Heard
you're working with my niece for that big interview thing they do.”
My mouth goes dry at the mention of Emilia, and before I even try, I
know I'm not going to be able to form any coherent words, so I nod.
“She's a good kid. I never had any of my own, but she's always felt like
mine, you know?”
I don't know, but I don't tell him that.
“Proud of her. She's accomplished a lot since she's been here.”
His lips are pulled into a wide smile, his eyes taking on a shine, and I
want to punch myself in the face because I'm standing here listening to him
praise his niece and pretending I don't know what she looks like with my
hands in her hair and my cock down her throat.
I swallow back the unease trying to climb its way up my esophagus.
“She seems…lovely.”
Lovely? Fucking hell, Owen.
His smile widens. “She is.” He gives his head a shake. “Anyway, I'll let
you get back to practice. Just wanted to get your opinion. You're our most
veteran guy, and we trust your gut instinct. We know you'll never do us
wrong, Smith.”
I give him a tightlipped smile before skating away, feeling like a
complete and total dirtbag and once again asking myself, What the hell did I
get myself into?
I pull open the door to Cup of Joe's and immediately spot Emilia at the back
of the small coffee shop that's a favorite local hangout spot. She must be
listening for the chime of the door because she whips her head up at the
sound and a bright smile curves her lips.
I'm taken aback by it. She's never once looked at me like she is now.
She must be thinking the same thing because it quickly transforms into
a frown. And then it goes somewhere in between the two as she lifts her
hand in a tiny wave.
It's cute. She's cute.
I point toward the coffee bar in a silent question, and she nods. I step up
to the counter and place my order for a small black coffee for myself and
another medium coffee with cream and three sugars, just how she likes.
“Sure thing,” the barista says, running her tongue over her lips, eyes
raking over me. “Anything else I can get you?”
“A muffin and a slice of banana bread too.”
“Sure.” She bites her lip. “Anything else?”
“Nope. Not a thing.”
Her shoulders deflate at the brushoff, and I can't help but laugh. Puck
bunnies, man.
When my order is up, I balance the drinks and plate together and make
my way over to the small table Emilia's secured.
“Thanks,” she mutters as I sit down.
“No problem.” I point to the plate. “Feel free to eat whichever. I like
both.”
“Me too.”
“Split them?” I suggest, and she nods.
I rip each one in half, then slide her coffee her way and watch as she
takes a tentative drink. Her eyes widen when she realizes it's right, and she
gives me that same impressed look I got last night when I remembered she
likes her whiskey sour with a lime wedge instead of lemon.
“This is perfect. Thank you.”
“You already said that,” I say.
Her cheeks turn pink. “Well, apparently I meant it, then.” She flicks her
eyes over to the coffee bar. “Make friends over there?”
I tip my head, studying her. “Jealous?”
She narrows her eyes, and I grin.
We sip our coffees and pick at our pastries in silence. That seems to
happen with us a lot—silence. I'm not sure if it's because we don't have
anything to say or if we have too much of it.
Her fingers go to the gold hoop dangling from her ear, and she tugs on
it, looking anywhere but at me. It's the same set of earrings she was
wearing the night we first met.
“Did you wear those on purpose?”
My words catch her off guard, and her eyes flash to mine with
confusion. I nod toward where her fingers still play with the jewelry.
“O-Oh,” she murmurs, dropping her hand into her lap. “I… No.” But
she doesn't sound sure about that at all.
She reaches into her bag where it sits next to her and pulls out a tablet.
She clicks around a few times before leveling me with an annoyed stare.
“Let's start by going over some questions you don't want to answer.”
“I don't want to answer any of them.”
She ignores me. “Well, you don't have a wife or children, so we can
skip those.” She reads over her list. “We can skip that too…and that…
and—”
“What's the point of this player profile again?”
“It's for the fans to get to know you and the game better.”
“Right, but it's obvious we can't even use half the questions, so what's
the point? Why me?”
“I don't know. Maybe because they admire you? You're a veteran player
and—”
I snort. “Veteran player. That's the polite way to say I'm old as shit.”
She quirks a brow. “You might be older than other players, but it
doesn't make you any less than them.”
I gnash my teeth in an attempt to push away the argument that's clawing
its way up my throat. I am less than them, and that's the problem. It's what
my agent called to talk about on the ride over here, putting me in a damn
sour mood.
“You're getting up there, Smith. I know you're focused on making the
playoffs right now, but you need to face the real possibility of not playing
for the Comets next year.”
Like I don't fucking know all of that already.
But he's right about one thing—I am currently focused on making a run
for the playoffs. I don't care about my contract expiring. I can't, not right
now.
“You have an incredible stats sheet,” she continues. “Not to mention
you've been with the Comets all your career, which is something most
players never experience. I think it intrigues people. They want to know
what keeps you here.”
Fear of change. Fear of screwing up my routine. Fear of being a failure
somewhere else.
But I don't say any of that.
Instead, I tell her, “I like it.”
Her green eyes bore into me like she's trying to reach inside my mind
and pull out all of my truths. But if she can see through my bullshit, she
doesn't call me on it.
“Right.” She clears her throat. “Are you comfortable talking about your
childhood? Our audience tends to like to know how far back your interest in
hockey goes, but if it's an uncomfortable subject for you, we can skip that.”
“I'm fine to talk about my childhood, but it might be boring. There's not
much to tell.”
Her brows crinkle together. “Why do you say that?”
“Because it's true.” I shrug. “I grew up pretty privileged with a nanny,
Bessie. She was the one who took me to and from the rink every day and
made sure I got to practice and games on time. She's the reason I got into
hockey like I did in the first place. Her brothers played and it was a game
she loved, and she passed that on to me since I spent so much time with her.
My parents would have preferred I go into a sport that's ‘much more
civilized,' as they put it.”
A soft smile plays on Emilia's lips. “Is Bessie somebody we can
interview for the profile?”
“She passed away about five years ago.”
Her smile fades, and I hate the pity that replaces it. “I'm sorry.”
I shrug again. “It's life.”
“Actually, that—” She cuts herself off with a shake of her head. “Never
mind. Not appropriate.”
“No.” I sit forward. “What were you going to say?”
She sighs. “I was going to say it kind of explains a lot about you.”
I tip my head. “How so?”
“Well…” She lifts her shoulders, then gestures toward me. “The whole
loner thing you have going on.”
I force myself not to grin. “My loner thing?”
“Yeah. It's not exactly a secret that you're a perpetual bachelor. If your
parents weren't around to show you real love and take care of you, it makes
sense that you are not…romantically inclined.”
“Thanks for the psychology lesson, Professor Anderson,” I mutter.
I've already sat down and analyzed my childhood. My parents might
not have been around often, but big whoop. It's not like I went without love.
I had Bessie. I had hockey. Both loved me, and I was good.
I am good.
“I found my great love, and I don't need another. Hockey is it for me.”
She pouts. “That's kind of…sad.”
“Sad?” I wave my hand around. “I get to play the greatest game on
earth, and I get paid to do it. Do I look sad?”
“Yes.”
Her immediate answer makes me pause because it seems so genuine…
and probably because she's not entirely wrong.
She leans forward. “Aren't you lonely, Smith? In the last few years
alone, several of your teammates have met the love of their life and gotten
married. Don't you want that for yourself? Someone to spend your time
with when you're not on the ice? Someone to go home to after away
games?”
Yes.
I do want that. I don't know when it snuck up on me that I do. Maybe it
was seeing Collin and Rhodes find love, and hell, now Lowell too. Maybe
it's just me getting older and wiser. I don't fucking know.
I just know that yeah, I am lonely.
But I'm not going to admit that to her.
“Aren't you lonely?” I toss back.
“Of course I'm lonely. But I…” She runs her tongue across her lips, her
gaze landing just over my shoulder, lost in a trance…or a memory. Her gaze
snaps back to mine, then she shakes her head. “But I can't have the things I
want, so I accept that.”
“Why are you letting yourself be lonely?”
“Why are you?” she throws right back at me.
I smirk. “I asked you first.”
She sighs, crossing her arms over her chest and sinking lower into her
seat. “You know why,” she whispers.
“Do I?”
She glares at me. “Seriously, Smith?”
“Yeah, seriously.” I match her heated stare with one of my own.
“Are we ever going to talk about what happened between us, or are we
just going to let it be this huge elephant in the room? Because I'm honestly
not sure I can work like this all season long.”
“What's there to talk about? It was just sex. You were on the rebound,
and I was sad about a Cup loss. That's all it was—sex.”
The moment the words leave my lips, I regret them.
It wasn't just sex. I know that, and based on the sharp breath she takes
in, she knows that too.
But maybe if I pretend it was, she will too, and we can get through this
whole thing unscathed. At the end of the day, there's nothing either of us
can do about it, and the sooner we accept that, the better.
“Fine.” She shoves her tablet into her bag, then rises. “I'll be in touch
about when we can meet next. Thanks for the coffee.”
She turns on her heel, then walks away from me.
And I let her leave all over again.

SMITH
Two & a half years ago
I'm usually not one for sleepovers.
Sex is just sex. I get off and I move on. There are no attachments to it.
There are no feelings. It's just an act, a release. Every person I'm with
knows the score.
But last night when Emilia was about to sneak away, I had this sudden
urge to keep her here.
It was alarming at first because it's a sensation I've never experienced
before. I tried to ignore it, but as she slipped to the edge of the bed to leave,
it grew, and I realized it was because something about her leaving just
didn't feel right.
So, I asked her to stay, and she did.
Waking up next to her this morning, I know I made the right call. She's
still fast asleep with her head on my chest, and part of me wants to wake her
up so I can devour her all over again, slower this time, but I'm also
enjoying watching her sleep way too much.
God, I can't believe I brought somebody home from Slapshots. It's like
my number one hookup rule—no Slapshots. It's a hockey bar, and a well-
known one at that, which means the people in there know hockey and who
the players are, which means the women are there on the prowl. As a good
rule of thumb, I avoid puck bunnies at all costs. Nothing good comes from a
puck bunny.
But there was no hint of recognition on Emilia's face last night. She
didn't look at me any differently than if I were just some random guy. I
knew she had no clue who I am, and as shitty as it sounds, I kind of want to
keep it that way for as long as possible.
We didn't exchange any info last night aside from our names, though
technically I wasn't even truthful about that since I gave her my last name.
But it was a test, and she passed.
I like that she passed.
I peer down at her as she sleeps soundly against me. Her lips are slightly
parted as she breathes a steady rhythm. Her red hair is a mess and all over
the bed. She has one hand clutched to my chest like she's holding on to me.
I don't know anything about this girl other than that she's ten years
younger than me, but there's something about her that makes me want to
know everything she has to tell me.
I don't get that feeling very often. Hell, I'm not sure I've ever gotten
that feeling before, and that's exactly why I asked her to stay.
She wiggles against me, and I can tell she's stirring awake. Her legs
stretch out and she does this cute little fluttering kick, and I know the exact
moment she realizes she's not alone and is attached to a stranger.
I watch as her eyes open and she takes in her surroundings. She seems
uncertain at first, but then last night hits her, and she seems calmer.
It takes another few moments for her to actually look at me. When she
does, there's a small, tentative smile on her lips. I kind of love that she's
nervous about this because deep, deep down, I'm nervous about this too.
“Hi,” she whispers.
“Hi,” I repeat back.
The softest giggle leaves her lips, and I'd do anything to hear that sound
again.
“Last night was…nice.”
I lift a brow. “Nice?”
Another giggle. “Okay, maybe a little more than nice.”
“Maybe a little more…” I shake my head, then grab her by the waist
and pull her until she's lying on top of me.
She gasps, laughing. “Smith! What are you—”
I tug her down, pressing my mouth to hers, not giving a shit about
morning breath as I kiss her hard. Her laughter turns to moans and soon
she's writhing against me, the evidence of what my kiss is doing to her
obvious as her wet pussy slides against my stomach. She moves her hips,
seeking the friction I'm offering.
I wrap one hand in her hair and the other gently around her throat,
applying just enough pressure to both spots. I pull her back, watching as she
rubs her pussy against me.
“Is this a little more than nice, Emilia?”
She nods, her teeth sinking into her lower lip.
“God, you're fucking beautiful,” I mutter, dragging her to me for
another hard kiss.
She doesn't slow her movements, using me to get herself off.
I love it, but I want more.
“Do you want to come, Emilia?” I ask against her lips.
She moans at my words. “Please, please, please.”
Laughing at her begging, I drop my hands from her throat and her hair,
and she slows her ministrations, her eyes flickering open at the loss of my
touch.
“Up,” I instruct.
“Up?”
I nod. “Stand up.”
She does, and I scoot until my back is resting against the headboard and
her cunt is right there, ready for me.
“Fuck,” I curse when I see how wet she really is. Her pussy is
glistening, and I know she was close just from rubbing herself against me. I
need to taste her. I didn't get to last night, and something tells me she's
going to be sweet.
“Use my tongue.”
“W-What?” she sputters.
I don't answer her. I just simply open my mouth and flatten my tongue.
Her eyes spark with understanding, and slowly, she bends her knees,
pressing her cunt against it. She sighs the moment we collide, and I was
fucking right. She's sweet, perfect.
And mine.
She fucks herself against my tongue, one hand on the wall, the other on
my head, holding me to her as if I could possibly want to be anywhere else.
I don't. I could stay here forever and never get tired of the way she
tastes.
She's close, but I can tell she's holding herself back. I want to make her
come so I can bury myself inside of her and then do it again. I slide my
hands up her legs, using one to steady her and the other to slip two fingers
inside of her without warning. She cries out, her knees nearly buckling
when I hook them, rubbing that spot I know she loves.
“Oh shit,” she screams.
Then she's falling over the edge, her pussy clenching around my
fingers, drawing them deeper as she works her clit against me still. I watch
her fall apart, her head thrown back, and it's beautiful.
She's beautiful.
I don't even give her a chance to let the quakes subside before I'm
tossing her onto the bed, pulling a condom from the nightstand, and
covering myself. I don't give her any warning before I sink inside of her.
“Holy shit,” I murmur, dropping my forehead to hers. “You're so
fucking tight, Emilia. I fit inside you perfectly.”
She hums a pleasured noise as I pump into her. “So perfect.”
I try—like really fucking try—to take it slow, but I can't. She feels too
fucking good. I fit my hand around her throat, loving the whimper that
escapes her as she wears my hand like a necklace, and I break.
I pump into her hard and fast. There's no real rhythm, no finesse. It's
pure, raw fucking.
And it is so damn good.
“Touch yourself,” I command.
Her eyes find mine as she slides her hand between us and starts rubbing
slow circles on her clit.
“God, you're perfect. You're doing so good,” I say, and her eyes spark
at my praise, spurring her to rub faster.
Her pants grow louder, her breaths coming sharper and sharper, and I
know she's close. I tighten my hold on her throat and she falls apart, her
tight cunt squeezing my release out of me as I fill the condom, pretending
it's her.
I drop to my elbows, cradling her head and kissing her slowly and
softly, a stark contrast to how I just used her. When I finally pull away, she's
grinning up at me, looking spent and satisfied.
“So, uh, what's for breakfast?”
Laughing, I slide off her and drop the condom in the trash can by my
bed, then turn back around. “Do you want to order in?”
She nods, and we spend the rest of the day in bed.
It's late Sunday night, nearly midnight, and though I've asked Emilia
several times if I can drive her home, she refuses. Which is why I'm
standing outside my apartment building on the sidewalk, waiting for an
Uber to show up and take her home. I clutch her closer to me, keeping my
arms locked around her, and she squeezes me back just as fiercely.
I feel so stupid for wanting her to stay.
All we've done over the last two days is stay hidden inside my
apartment. We've ordered in for every meal, watched my favorite movie,
Point Break, and hers, The Princess Bride, and have fucked on just about
every square inch of every surface in this apartment.
More than that, we talked. A lot.
We talked about her douchebag ex and everything that happened with
them, and it took every ounce of willpower I had not to hop in my car and
drive across the state and beat his skull in for hurting her.
I told her about my secret love of puzzles and showed her my
collection. After laughing at me and calling me an old man for it, she forced
me to start one with her. We didn't get far before our clothes wound up on
the floor again.
She told me about how she wants to vacation in Europe for two weeks
and gave me a very detailed plan of everything she'd go see and do and
how this new job of hers came with a big pay raise, so she might actually be
able to afford it soon. I had to fight the urge to get on my phone and book
her dream vacation right then and there because that trip is nothing but a
drop in the bucket for me.
We talked about so much but still left out so many simple details. It's
the lightest I've felt in years, and not just because of the sex.
The sad part is, we both know when she leaves, whatever magical
bubble we've been living inside for the past two days will burst.
I can ask her to stay. I can ask to see her again. I know that.
I also know if she wanted to stay, she would. She's been using this
weekend to escape reality just as much as I have, but tomorrow's Monday,
and we have to go back to that reality at some point.
My heart climbs into my throat as the Uber pulls up to the curb.
This is it.
And for some reason, I don't want this to be it.
I think if we were in different places in our lives, if she hadn't just
gotten out of a bad relationship and if I didn't have hockey front and center
in my life, we could make something work.
But we do have those things, so this is it for us.
“Thank you for this, Smith,” she says quietly.
Owen. My name is Owen.
I want to scream it at her.
But I don't.
“Thank you, Emilia.”
She swallows thickly, then pushes to her toes, and our mouths collide
for the last time.
It's not a rushed kiss. It's sweet and slow, and I take my time
remembering every single moment of it.
“Uh, not to like interrupt or anything, but I'm here for Emilia?” the
Uber driver says, definitely interrupting.
Emilia laughs against me, and the moment is broken. I place one last
soft kiss against her lips before taking a step away from her, tucking my
hands into my pockets so I don't reach out for her and steal her away back
upstairs to our little haven.
A smile pulls at her lips, and she tips her head, studying me. She opens
her mouth to say something but thinks better of it.
I pull open the car door for her, and I'm hit with panic.
“Wait! Your number. Give me your number.”
Her face falls. “Smith, I—”
“I want to make sure you get home okay, and I'm not taking no for an
answer.”
She contemplates it and I know she wants to say no, but I'm praying she
doesn't.
“Okay,” she agrees quietly.
She picks her phone up and taps open the keypad so I can punch my
number in. When I hand the device back over to her, I don't let her take it
immediately.
Instead, I tug her back in.
“Smith…” She breathes out against me. “I have to go.”
“I know.” I nod, swallowing down my pleas for her to stay. “I know.”
With one final kiss, I let her walk away.
The Uber pulls onto the street, and I have no idea how long I stand there
watching. It's long enough that the taillights have been gone for what feels
like hours before I finally force myself back into my building. I don't even
bother with the elevator. I take the stairs, deserving the punishment for
letting her go like a fool.
As I reach the final step, my phone buzzes in my pocket, and I scramble
to check it.
Unknown: Safe at home.
Unknown: Thank you again for this weekend. Thank you for
giving me a safe place to hide. You'll never know how much it
meant to me.
Unknown: Good night, Smith.
Her last two words are final, and I can read between the lines enough to
know that our bubble? It burst.
And because I know I shouldn't, I don't text her back.

EMILIA
It would be an absolute lie if I said I didn't come into work yesterday
morning with every intention of telling Tori there was no way I would be
able to do the piece on Smith.
But I knew if I did, I would have to explain to her why I couldn't do the
piece…and that's not a conversation I'm ready to have.
Besides, letting him win and get the better of me? Well, that's just not
the type of person I am.
Just sex? Just sex my ass.
He knows as well as I do that those two nights we spent together meant
a whole lot more. If they didn't, we wouldn't have spent the last two-plus
years doing everything in our power to avoid one another.
Maybe it's all in my head though. Maybe it was just sex. Perhaps my
fascination with him is because he's off-limits. Maybe I'm the one who
needs to move on.
I need to forget about what happened, forget about him in any capacity
other than hockey. I have a job to do, and that's what I need to be focusing
on.
“Hey, how's everything going with Smith?”
I sigh as Blake rests his ass on my desk, the same spot he always sits in.
“Uh-oh. That bad?”
“Let's just say it was a grumpy day for him.”
“Isn't it always a grumpy day for him?”
“True, but when we met for coffee, he was extra grumpy.”
Blake obviously doesn't know the details of my past with Smith.
Nobody knows them, not even Hollis. She knows I met someone when I
first moved here, but that's it. She doesn't know who it was because I didn't
even know who he was then.
When we discovered he played for the Comets and I'd just accepted a
job with them, we cut off all contact and have existed in this weird plane of
avoiding one another ever since. Now though, we can't, and I'm beginning
to realize it's going to be a lot harder to collaborate with him than I
anticipated.
Blake frowns. “Well, at least he said yes. I mean, that's the first big
hurdle, you know? And if he gets too out of line, you can just tell your
uncle and he can whip him into shape.”
I laugh. “Right. Tori already hates me for nepotism. The last thing I
need to do is sic my uncle on an unruly player. I can take care of it. I'm not
scared of Smith.”
Though this would probably be a lot easier if I were…
“If you need help, just let me know. I've been working on my dad voice,
but Nate says I could use more practice on it, so if I need to bust it out on
some hockey players, I'll do it.”
I laugh again. “I'll keep that in mind.”
“Good, good. But also, while I'm here…”
I groan because nothing good ever comes after he says that. “Oh god.”
“It's nothing awful. We're just down a photographer since it's so close
to the holiday…” He pauses when I glare at him because I know where this
is going. “Everyone else is wrapped up in their own projects, so we don't
have anyone to photograph the arrivals. I'd do it, but Tori has me working
on something else and she's already mad at me for dipping out early
yesterday, so…”
He grins broadly, and I want so badly to say no, but I know I can't.
I sigh. “Fine, I'll do it—but I'm not going to be happy about it.”
“I really didn't think you would be, but it's been noted.” He pretends to
scribble a note onto his hand, then hops off my desk. “I'm off to get these
graphics made before puck drop.”
“She has you on graphic duty? But that's…”
“Totally not my job? I know, but I think she knows I hate it, so here I
am.” He rolls his eyes. “Thanks for helping out. I'll let Dom know you're
on your way down.”
I hit save on the project I've been working on, then rise from my desk
and head for the equipment room. I grab a camera and make my way down
to the garage.
It's still sunny out, so I decide to take some pics of the guys coming in
from the lot.
The minute I step outside, I regret it. It's windy as hell, and it sends a
shiver through me. I should have known better. December around here can
be unpredictable, freezing cold one day, warm and sunny the next. It's
definitely sunny, but that wind chill is killer.
Nevertheless, I have a job to do, and the team is starting to arrive. I lift
the camera just in time to see Miller and Rhodes making their way into the
building.
Miller blows the camera a kiss.
Rhodes—who is scowling per usual—smacks him in the back of the
head.
I laugh as I take the shot because the moment is just too good to pass
up.
A few more guys arrive, including the goalie, Greer, who has been
making a splash on our social media lately. Everyone in the comments has
been going nuts over him and his skills. I'm eager to see how well he does
in this last stretch of the season.
I lift the camera to my eye to adjust a few things, then spot Smith
pulling in at the other end of the lot. He backs into a spot, then shuts off his
shiny black truck and hops out with a coffee cup in hand. I don't know if
that's a requirement before the game, but it seems like it since all the guys
carry one in.
His dark hair is pushed back off his head in a haphazard way, and his
face is covered with at least two days' worth of stubble. He's wearing a
navy suit with a simple white dress shirt underneath. His tie is dark red, and
even though it's not the most noteworthy ensemble, he sure wears it like it
is. The outfit looks every bit like it was tailored to fit him, and I don't mind
it at all.
He looks good. Too good.
Like a-tightness-pulling-low-in-my-belly kind of good.
Someone clearing their throat draws my attention, and I nearly jump
when I see Lowell through the lens, standing just a few feet away. He looks
behind him at Smith—who is making his way through the lot—then back at
me, and his lips pull up into a knowing smirk.
I hate it and want to hide.
My cheeks warm ten degrees. “Evening, Lowell.”
“Emilia. Lovely view out tonight, yeah?”
I let out a low squeak at being caught and called out, and Lowell laughs,
shaking his head.
“Don't worry…your secret is safe with me.”
“What secret?”
He just shakes his head again, smirk still in place as he disappears into
the building. Panic sets in the moment he's out of sight.
Did Smith tell him what happened between us? Did Lowell guess
himself? If so, does it mean it's obvious to everyone else? Does Tori know?
Is this some kind of test?
No. There's no way. Smith and I have barely been in the same room
since I started with the team. It's just not possible for her to know anything.
I shake the worry off and turn my attention back to my job. Wright jogs
over toward Smith, and the two bump fists as they head for the building
together. I can't make out what they're saying, but whatever Wright says
has Smith's lips tipping up into a smile. He doesn't do it often enough, and
it's a shame because he's even more handsome when it happens.
The wind whips up again, and I shiver from the onslaught.
“Here you go, Miss Anderson,” says Dom, one of our security guards,
as he slips his jacket over my shoulders. I relish the warmth, tugging the
material around me together.
I shoot him a wink. “You're my hero, Dom.”
His cheeks pinken and he returns to his post.
I lift my camera and grab a few shots of Wright and Smith walking in
but stop short when I realize Smith's eyes have shot my way. His brows are
drawn tightly together as he glowers at me with a hateful stare. He's
looking at the jacket draped over my shoulders like it's the most offensive
thing he's ever seen.
His eyes flick to Dom, then back to the jacket, then to me.
It's almost like…
Holy shit. He's jealous.
A warm tingle hits my lower belly when I meet his tawny eyes, which
are dark and stormy. I want to walk over and smooth the crease between his
brows…but I also want to make it deepen.
How messed up does it make me that I like seeing him jealous?
Beside him, Wright is carrying on a full-blown one-sided conversation,
missing the whole thing completely.
I don't. I press the button and capture the shot as he stares at me, the
intensity never waning.
When I drop the camera, Smith's attention is back on Wright, and it's
like it never even happened. It's such a sudden change that even I question
if it was real.
But then Wright notices me and grins, Smith scowls his way too, and I
know it was real.
“Hey, Emilia. You're still coming for Christmas dinner, right? Harper's
been freaking out about the menu and worrying if she bought enough food.”
“I'll be there after I stop by my uncle's,” I promise.
Since moving out here, I've taken to having Christmas brunch with my
uncle. He's all alone since my aunt died six years ago, so I like to spend the
holidays with him.
“Christmas dinner?” Smith asks the defenseman.
“Yeah. Do you want in? The more the merrier. Just figured your grumpy
ass wouldn't want to hang out with us.”
“I'm in,” Smith answers quickly.
Wright's brows shoot up along with mine.
He's going to be there? How is it I've avoided him so much for the last
couple of years and now suddenly I have to spend all my free time with
him? And why don't I hate the idea of it?
“You are?” Wright asks him with a grin.
Smith lifts his shoulders. “Sure. Why not? Not like I have anything else
to do.”
“All right. I'll tell Harper. Bring booze.”
Smith grunts out a reply, and I snap another picture as they pass, not
missing Smith's eyes sliding my way as he disappears into the building.
I stand outside for another half hour as the rest of the team filters in,
then I head upstairs to get the photos loaded into the shared folder so the
graphics gurus—tonight that's Blake—can get them edited and ready for
posting before puck drop.
I click through the images, checking to make sure everything came out
okay, and I pause when I get to the ones of Smith.
God, the look he's giving the camera…I should be embarrassed that it
has my thighs clenching together, but I'm just not.
Even though I shouldn't, I love seeing him so riled up over me. It
reminds me of the nights we spent together, the intensity, the
possessiveness. I've never felt so important to someone before, and though
it was short-lived, I want to feel that again.
I click away before I get caught daydreaming, then save the photos to
the folder and get started on wrapping up everything else I need to do
before the game. When I'm satisfied that it's all complete, I head down the
hall and pop my head into Blake's office.
“Hey, I'm going down to the game,” I say. “You coming?”
He's fully engrossed in whatever is on his phone, but after a few
seconds, he pops his head up, eyes wide. It's alarming.
“Everything okay?” I ask hesitantly, hoping it's not a fire I need to put
out. All I want is to go watch the game and relax tonight.
“Have you seen the comments on these?”
“On what?”
“The arrival photos. Look.”
I slink into his office and stand behind his desk as he pulls up the team's
Instagram on his computer. He expands the comments, and my mouth
slackens at what I see on the screen. There are hundreds of them, way more
than we typically get, and they all say a variation of the same thing.
HoneyBree19: Granny Smith Apple? More like DADDY Smith Apple.
Bardown1991: THAT LOOK! *fans self*
HckyisLife: Dude, Smith looks READY to go!
KeepingUpWithKeeley: I don't even watch hockey and here I am in the
comments.
AmberWavesofFAME: I wish my husband looked at me the way he is
looking at whoever is behind that camera. He's giving MAJOR BDE.
*eggplant emoji*
CldBURStckHndlr: WOW. I'm pretty sure if he looked at me like that,
there's no way I'd be wearing panties for long.
“They all need a large glass of water because they are thirsty. I mean, not
that I blame them, because that photo is wow.”
“What picture did you post?” My heart is pounding so hard I pray he
can't hear it or the waver of my voice.
He clicks through the carousel of photos, but he doesn't have to tell me
which one it is. I already know.
It's the same photo I was clenching my thighs to just a little bit ago.
The fans aren't wrong—the look he's giving the camera is pantymelting. Thank gosh none of them know it was me behind the lens.
“What did you do to him? Did you say something? Because he's
looking at you like he wants to rip your clothes off.”
Probably because he does want to rip my clothes off, Dom's jacket in
particular.
But I don't tell Blake any of that.
Instead, I shrug. “I don't know. He was just grumpy. You know how
Smith is.”
Blake's brows rise. “Honey, that look he's giving you…that isn't just
him being grumpy. There is some serious sexual tension hiding underneath
it.”
His words spark a panic in me, and I look around the office to make
sure nobody was walking by when he said that. The last thing I need is a
bunch of rumors being spread.
“Shh!”
“What? I'm teasing! Unless…”
My blood is pumping so hard I can hardly hear the lie tumbling from
my lips. “Don't be ridiculous. He has no interest in me. He was just
annoyed with something Wright was talking his ear off about.”
It's easily the biggest lie I've ever told Blake, and I immediately feel
bad about it. But right now, this lie is what's saving my career. I just hope
Tori doesn't see these photos, scrutinize them too closely, and start putting
two and two together.
Blake's eyes narrow, and for a moment, I'm terrified he's going to press
me and all the sordid details are going to come tumbling out because I am
dying to tell someone.
By some miracle, he lets me off the hook. “All right. But I'm just
saying…Stick Handler here is right. If Nate looked at me like that, I would
not be wearing pants for long.”
He laughs, and I force myself to do the same.
“Okay, come on,” he says, clicking out of the account, then rising from
his chair. “Let's go watch the game and hope the boys win, because I do not
feel like staying up all night and monitoring our social media for the
crazies.”
I breathe a sigh of relief as I follow him out. At least for now, my secret
is still safe.

SMITH
“Last home game tonight, boys! Let's fucking win this!” Miller slams his
shoulder into mine, jostling me on the bench, then darts away before I can
retaliate.
It's funny how we all have different ways to prep for games. Mine is to
be alone with my thoughts. I like the solitude of it all.
Miller, on the other hand, is that guy who needs loud music blaring and
even louder conversations. He's the one running around the dressing room,
bouncing on his heels with excitement.
Most days I can tolerate it, but tonight? Tonight, I want to rip his stupid
phone from the charging dock and toss it across the room so the incessant
Christmas music he insists on playing stops. I want to tell him to shut up,
and I really fucking want to get back out on the ice already and land some
hits.
It's all because I'm pissed.
I'm pissed because I let myself get upset about Emilia wearing
somebody else's jacket.
I'm not stupid. I'm sure she's been with other people since we were
together. There's no reason for her not to. She's gorgeous, and how anyone
can resist her is beyond me. I've accepted that.
But seeing it? Man, it blows.
Of course the moment I walked through the door and realized it was
likely Dom just being a gentleman, I felt like a fucking fool for having any
sort of reaction to it at all. I'm almost forty years old for shit's sake. I
shouldn't be getting jealous, especially not over someone who isn't mine.
That happens with Emilia a lot though. I do things I shouldn't be doing.
I wish I could get her out of my head. I wish I could forget anything
happened between us.
But I can't, and that's the problem.
“You good?” Lowell asks from beside me.
I peek over at him and nod. “Yeah, I'm good.”
His dark brows shoot up. “You sure about that? You don't seem good.”
“I said I'm fine.”
“No, you said you're good. There's a difference between fine and good.
If you had ever been in a serious relationship, you'd know that.”
I don't point out that up until he got Hollis pregnant, he had only been
in one “serious” relationship himself. Now he's talking to me like he's some
fucking expert. Funny for a guy still denying he's even in a relationship.
“Shut up,” I mutter.
He laughs, then looks around to make sure nobody is paying us any
attention and leans in. “This have anything to do with the woman behind
the camera today?”
I don't even bother acting surprised by his words.
Lowell isn't stupid. I'm sure he's picked up over the years that
something is off with Emilia and me, especially over the summer at Harper
and Collin's wedding when I was having a weak moment and spent far too
much of the night staring in her direction.
Yes, it has everything to do with her, I want to scream. She's suddenly
everywhere, and it's driving me insane.
“It's nothing,” I tell him instead.
“You can talk to me, you know. I'll totally braid your hair while we
swap secrets.”
He grins at me, and I shake my head, laughing.
It might sound like he's joking, but I know he's being serious. While I
trust every member of this team, if I were going to spill my guts to anyone,
it would be Lowell.
“Meant to tell you…I texted Harper before the game and told her you're
in for Christmas. She's excited you're finally joining us,” Collin says,
dropping down beside Lowell, adjusting his elbow pads while we wait for
the second period to start.
I try not to groan at the mention of the Christmas dinner I agreed to. I
have no idea why I even said yes.
Okay, that's a lie. I know exactly why I did.
Emilia.
I have no business going, but I want to because now that I've spent time
with her, I want to do it again. Maybe my masochistic streak runs deeper
than I realize.
“You're coming to Christmas?” Lowell asks me, a stupid fucking smirk
ghosting across his lips.
I glower at him in response.
His smirk turns into a full-blown grin, and I already know I'm going to
regret going to this damn meal because I just know he's going to be giving
me that same ridiculous smile the entire time.
“I can't wait,” he says, his eyes sparkling with mischief.
Yeah, me either.
It's a good feeling to win a game no matter what, but to win our entire
homestand? Fucking amazing.
Sure, we still have the second half of the season, but getting these points
early lets us breathe just a little easier. We've been playing hard, and tonight
we played even harder. Our defense was top-notch, and our goal-scoring
was even better. We walked out with a five-to-nothing win.
We're officially on Christmas break, and despite how I felt before
hitting the ice, I feel like I'm flying right now. On a total high from a good
game, I take my time standing under the hot water to help work out the
soreness I'm definitely feeling from a hard checking game against Chicago.
Much like I enjoy being the last in the room before a game, I like being
the last to leave after, so by the time I turn the water off, it's just me and
two other guys left. One wraps up his post-game routine and gives me a
wave before heading home to his wife and three kids, and the other is Greer,
who looks like he's about to take off too.
“Nobody to run home to, old man?”
I glare at him because he knows nobody is waiting at home for me.
Miller invited me out to Slapshots tonight, and for a moment I consider
taking him up on it just to show this little prick that I do have plans. Then I
think better of it. I'd rather just go home and get a good night's rest. We're
leaving right after Christmas for a six-game road trip, and if I'm not
sleeping in my bed for that long, I'm getting as much time in it now as I
possibly can.
And I don't give a shit how old that makes me sound.
He laughs, then stuffs the last of his things in his cubby. “See you after
the break, Apple.”
It's very bah humbug of me, but I flip him off behind his back. Feeling
satisfied, I finish getting dressed, then make sure I have everything before
finally heading for the parking lot. I round the corner to leave—and run
smack into someone coming the opposite way.
I reach out to steady them, and only then do I realize it's the last person
I'm expecting to see tonight. I drop my hands and she takes a step away
from me, and I fucking hate that she does it.
“Smith,” she says, sounding like she's out of breath. “What are you still
doing here?”
“I'm always the last to leave,” I explain.
She nods, glancing left and right, likely checking to make sure nobody
is sulking around. “I'll make a note of that for the player profile,” she
teases. She clears her throat. “Good game tonight, by the way. Not far into
the season and you're already racking up those assists, Apple.”
I don't hate the nickname as much coming from her, and that's because
she genuinely means it. She's not poking fun at my age or anything else;
she's actually excited about my accomplishments.
“Thanks,” I murmur.
Then, we stand there awkwardly. Neither of us makes a move to say
anything, but we're also not running to get away. We're just standing here. I
stare down at her, and she meets my stare with a steady one of her own.
And then all at once, we both start talking.
“So I—”
“Listen, I—”
We laugh, and I motion for her to go first.
She looks unsure as she brushes her long red locks from her face and
rolls her tongue along her lips, taking a deep breath as she shoves her
shoulders back.
“I want to apologize for what happened at the coffee shop yesterday, for
bringing up our…history. It was unprofessional, and I shouldn't have done
it. We've been doing a good job of pretending it never happened, so there
was no reason we couldn't have kept doing that, no reason for us to keep
dragging it up. You were right—it was just sex.”
Her eyes flick away at her last words, and she folds her arms around her
stomach, almost like she's protecting herself. I don't like it. I don't like her
walking around thinking that weekend meant nothing to me. It did—a lot
more than it probably should have.
Before I even realize what I'm doing, I haul her farther down the
hallway until I'm certain we're alone. Then, because I can't fucking help
myself, I box her in with my arms. She peers up at me with wide eyes, her
gaze growing dark and her breaths coming in short spurts like her lungs are
hungry for air.
“W-What are you…”
“I lied.”
“W-What?”
“I lied. What I said yesterday…I lied.” I lean into her. “It wasn't just
sex, Emilia.”
“But you said—”
“I know what I said, and I fucking lied.” She gulps at the harshness of
my words. “Do you really think I could just forget our weekend together?
Do you really think there is any possible way I can look back on that and
think it was just sex? After knowing what you feel like…” She sucks in a
sharp breath. “Taste like…it's impossible.”
She's panting now, her eyes full of confusion and lust and so many
other emotions that I'm sure match what's in my own gaze.
“It was never just sex. It'll never be just sex. I wish it could be. I really
do.” I drop my forehead to hers. “Because I can't forget you, Emilia. No
matter how hard I try…I can't.”
Her breaths come in sharp, and I can feel them ghosting along my lips.
Half an inch…that's how close I am to tasting her again, and I want to
taste her again so damn badly.
Her breasts brush against my chest with each heavy inhale she takes,
and I have to try hard to convince myself to not press my body against hers.
If I do, I'm a goner.
“Owen…”
My head snaps up.
She said my name.
It sounds stupid, absolutely ridiculous, but I've always been Smith,
never Owen.
It's just four letters, but they roll off her tongue like a poem, and it's the
best one I've ever heard.
I like it. Entirely too much.
I lean into her, and that familiar scent of lavender and vanilla fills all my
senses, making my mind spin with the memories of before. Of her naked.
Of her on her knees. Of her spread across my bed as I devoured her.
I want it all again.
There's a distant thud, and we're so lost in our own little world that it
sounds a million times closer than it likely is. Whatever it is, it's enough to
break whatever is happening between us.
Her tongue slides across her lips again and she looks up at me, so much
regret in her eyes for the words she hasn't even said yet but that I know are
coming.
“We can't.”
Two quiet words that sound like an anvil dropping.
I could kiss her. I could kiss her, and I know she'd kiss me back because
she wants this too.
But…she's right. We can't do this.
Because if we do this, I won't be able to stop. Not when I know how
good we can be together.
So, I don't.
Instead, I push off the wall, creating space between us that I wish didn't
have to be there. She stays with her back pressed against the wall, her chest
heaving up and down like she's breathing for the first time in hours.
“I…”
I shake my head, cutting off whatever it is she's about to say.
She nods, rolling her tongue across her lips again and pushing off the
wall. She runs her hand through her hair, straightens her blouse, and then
slips past me.
I don't move.
I don't even watch her leave. The click of her heels against the floor is
the only indication I have that she's stopped.
Quietly, she says, “Good night…Smith.”
I hate that I'm no longer Owen.

EMILIA
I almost kissed Smith.
It's been two days and I can't forget about it. I should have seen that
coming though. It's been two years since I slept with him, and I can't forget
that either.
My focus was shit as I tried to wrap everything up before the short
Christmas break, and it sucked when Tori had to pull me out of my
daydreaming more than once. I couldn't help it though. All I could think
about was how close I was to throwing away everything I'd been working
so hard for.
He consumed me. That scent that's all of him invaded every inch of me,
and I didn't even want to take my clothes off when I got home, afraid it had
seeped into them and I was going to lose it somehow. I should have known
better because even now, I swear I can still smell him.
Just like I can still clearly see the swirls of yellows and browns in his
eyes as he peered down at me. He was giving me the same look he did two
years ago when I was on my knees for him, a look I wouldn't mind seeing
again.
“Doing all right, Em?” Uncle Jared asks, brows drawn tightly together
as he stares at me, face full of concern.
“Huh?” I shake my head, tossing away the thoughts I shouldn't be
having, especially not when I'm in my uncle's home. I hope he doesn't
notice the red in my cheeks. “Sorry, yeah. I'm good. Just tired.”
“Tori working you hard, eh?” He laughs, rinsing off a dirty plate. “That
woman is…intense.”
“Don't I know it.”
He doesn't even know half of it. I'm thankful for this short Christmas
break not just because I get a break from Smith, but because I get a break
from Tori and her watchful eyes.
“I heard she's thinking of having you take over as director…” He peeks
up at me, and I can clearly see the pride in his eyes. “That true?”
“It's true. Well, me or Blake. Though Blake isn't really interested.”
He nods. “Because of Nate and that adorable new baby of theirs. I
understand that. The NHL is demanding, and it's different when you have
kiddos involved. Speaking of…”
He laughs when I groan.
“Come on, kid. You can't hide behind your job forever. You have to get
back out there sometime.”
My uncle thinks I'm still hung up on my ex. And I guess in a way, I am
a little bit. I'm a lot more guarded and a lot less likely to give my trust away
so easily, but that's not the reason I'm single.
“I'm focusing on my career right now,” I tell him.
Which is the absolute honest truth. When I first got here, I was
overwhelmed by everything that went into the social media aspect of an
NHL team. It's not an easy job by any means, and I knew I needed to prove
I didn't just get the job because of my uncle. I busted my ass, and I continue
to bust my ass because I love doing this, being part of something bigger.
Am I lonely? Sure. Would it be nice to have someone to come home to
at night? Of course, but I'm just not in a place for anything serious. I have
too much on the line to let myself get distracted by dating.
My phone buzzes against the counter, and I reach for it, looking for any
chance to get out of this conversation.
Harper: Don't forget a small gift for the exchange, and please
remember to bring your choice of booze!
Lowell: Please bring booze because I'm going to need it. I'm
meeting Hollis' mom tonight.
Harper: Oh, hush. She's not that bad.
Miller: Wait…
Miller: We have to bring our OWN booze? But Wright makes
more than all of us! Make him buy.
Rhodes: Nah. Lowell's got him beat by half a mil.
Lowell: Damn right I do. Makin' them big bucks, baby.
Miller: Going to need them for that kid you have on the way
too.
Wright: Can we NOT talk about our AAV?? It's Christmas and
I don't want to embarrass the rookie.
Miller: I AM NOT A ROOKIE!
Wright: Then stop acting like one, dipshit.
Harper: Stop the name-calling. It's mean.
Wright: Yes, ma'am.
Miller: Getting kinky, huh?
Rhodes: It's not mean if it's true. The kid is a dipshit.
Ryan: Be nice, Adrian.
Miller: Oooooh, she first-named you. You hate your first name.
Ryan: He doesn't ALWAYS hate his first name. *evil emoji*
Miller: He loves it during sex, doesn't he??
Wright: Shut up, Miller.
Lowell: Shut up, Miller.
Rhodes: Shut the fuck up, Miller.
I laugh as the last three messages all roll in at the same time. Miller is a
well-known shit disturber among the entire staff, so none of this surprises
me at all.
“That your friends?” my uncle asks as he finishes loading the
dishwasher.
“Yes. They're mostly just yelling at Miller.”
“That kid.” He shakes his head. “He's something else.”
“That's one way to put it.”
“But an incredible player.” My uncle looks at me. “Don't tell him I said
that though. It'll go straight to his head. We're trying to keep him knocked
down a peg or two.”
“My lips are sealed.”
“Good.” He winks. “Are you heading over to Wright's house for
dinner?”
I nod. “Yes. Ms. Kelly will be there. She's meeting Lowell for the first
time.”
“Still can't believe that whole ordeal,” my uncle mumbles. Then he tips
his head toward the door, grabbing a dishtowel and drying his hands. “Go
have fun with them. No sense in you hanging around here with me all day.
I'm probably just going to fall asleep on the recliner watching Home Alone
or something.”
“Are you sure?” I ask, chewing on my lip.
“Of course, kiddo. Get out of here.”
“All right.” I hop down from the stool, then round the island and press a
kiss to his cheek. “Merry Christmas, Uncle Jared.”
“Merry Christmas, Em. Tell Mrs. Kelly I said hi, and make sure none of
my players break any rules. We have some games to win.”
He throws me a playful wink, and I try not to react to the fact that one
of his players already has broken a rule…and it's all my fault.
I take a deep breath as I pull into Harper and Collin's neighborhood. On one
hand, I'm excited about our little get-together tonight. We don't all get to
hang out outside of the rink during the season as much as I'd like.
But on the other hand…spending Christmas with Smith isn't exactly
what I had in mind. I know there is no way I'm going to be able to relax
tonight knowing he's here. I'm going to have to pretend I don't want to kiss
him, pretend I haven't already kissed him.
I breathe a sigh of relief when I pull my little Toyota in behind Hollis'
BMW, grateful that Smith isn't here yet.
Thank fuck.
Maybe he canceled? He doesn't usually come to any social gatherings.
Not really his scene, which is why I was so surprised when he said he'd be
here. Maybe he's bailing and I won't have to endure several hours of
pretending around all of our friends. Maybe—
Maybe I'm not that lucky because lights in my rearview mirror grab my
attention, and I know it's him.
Fuck.
I close my eyes and smack my head against the headrest a few times,
trying to talk myself into just getting out and getting it all over with. You
can do this, Emilia. Just pretend you don't want to rip his clothes off. You
got this. You can—
My thoughts are interrupted by knocking on my window. I don't peel
my eyes open because I know who it is.
It's him. I can feel his stare.
“Open up, Emilia.”
I'm taken back to the nights we spent together with just three simple
words, to when I was on my knees for him, his cock pressing against my
lips.
“Open up, Emilia.”
I drop my jaw.
“Good girl.”
I shiver at the memory, wondering if he realizes the effect those words
have on me.
He knocks again, and this time I do open my eyes and meet his dark
stare that's daring me to continue ignoring him.
I don't.
I push open the door and he's there, grabbing it and holding his hand out
for me. I ignore the gesture, pulling myself from the car.
He doesn't miss it.
“I'm surprised you came,” I say, alleviating the tension between us.
He shrugs, shoving a hand into his pocket and rocking back on his
heels. “Didn't have much else going on, so I figured why not. I used to do
Christmas with Bessie and her family, but they're all grown up and out of
state, and since Bessie is gone, well…”
He trails off, and it makes me sad for him. Does that mean he's been
doing Christmas alone for years? Does that mean he does all holidays
alone? I picture him eating takeout on his couch by himself with nobody
else around, and there's a dull ache in my chest for him.
“Don't give me that look,” he says sharply.
“What look?” I ask innocently.
“Pity.” He shakes his head. “I don't need it. Loner, remember?”
I lift my brow. “Alone, remember?”
His dark brows slam together, and he looks like he wants to say
something but thinks better of it. “I'm here now, aren't I?”
I know that's not what he wanted to say, but I let him have it.
“You are. Bring anything good for the gift exchange?” I ask, trying to
peek into the bag in his hand.
He tucks it behind his back, a hint of a smile ghosting his lips. “I'm not
telling.”
“Oh, come on. It'll be our little secret.”
The moment the words leave my lips, I realize my mistake. The air
around us changes from playful to serious fast. He lifts his free hand,
scrubbing at the scruff covering his face, then sighs.
“Emilia, I—”
“I bring Christmas cheer and Christmas beer!”
Miller's sudden intrusion has us jumping apart. If he notices—which
isn't likely because it's Miller—he doesn't say anything.
Smith clears his throat, putting space between us as he slides his free
hand into his back pocket.
“Hey, why the long faces? We're here to get lit!”
Smith glares at him. “Do not go in there thinking you're going to get
drunk. Hollis and Harper's mother is here.”
“Oh shit.” His brows rise. “She hot?”
“Miller!”
The guy in question holds his hands up as best he can with a six-pack of
beer in each one. “What? It's a genuine question!”
Smith steps toward him, pointing a finger at his face. “Do not hit on her,
Miller. I mean it.”
“Well, if I can't hit on her, who can I hit on?”
“Nobody! Put your dick away.”
Miller's shoulders sink and he mutters something that sounds an awful
lot like My dick is always away as he walks toward the house, but I know
that can't be right based on what I've heard about him.
Smith and I follow behind, keeping a respectable distance between the
two of us. Miller tries to walk right in, but Smith smacks him across the
backside of his head, so he presses the doorbell instead.
It doesn't take long before Collin and Harper are pulling the door open,
greeting us with smiles and hugs.
“Beer's here!” Miller shouts, walking into the house.
Collin looks back at us. “Is it too late to uninvite him?”
“Unfortunately, it is. Just watch out for him near your mother-in-law.
He's on the prowl.”
“Well, hello, you,” Miller purrs, striding into the kitchen and beelining
straight for Hollis and Harper's mom. He bows dramatically, then grabs her
hand, placing a kiss on the back of it. “Did my heart love till now?”
“Okay, Shakespeare.” Collin charges his way. “You're done.”
“Anyone else wildly impressed that Collin knows Shakespeare?” Ryan
comments as Miller takes off and Collin chases after him.
“I'm more impressed that Miller knows it,” her husband adds, slipping
an arm around her waist and tugging her close.
“Either way, I'm flattered,” Evelyn, Hollis and Harper's mother, says as
she makes her way over to me and pulls me in for a hug. “So good to see
you again, Emilia.”
I squeeze her tightly, loving the familiar warmth she brings me. Much
like Smith's, my childhood isn't much to write home about. My father spent
most of his time working and very little time caring about anything I did.
My mother tried her best to make up for him but didn't do much to hide the
fact that the wine made her smile more than he ever could. If I wasn't at my
uncle's, I was spending time at the Kelly household. Evelyn always had a
way of making me feel special.
“Hey, Evelyn. You excited about being a grandmother?”
“Very much so. Just wish they'd let it spill what they're having.” She
looks pointedly at Lowell, who mimics zipping his lips. “So rude.” She rolls
her eyes playfully, then looks at Smith. “I don't think I've met your
boyfriend yet.”
The squeak that leaves me is embarrassingly loud, and everyone in the
room who knows who Smith is laughs.
“They aren't dating, Mom. That's Smith—he's a teammate of
Lowell's,” Hollis tells her.
“Hmm…” Evelyn says, her watchful eyes bouncing between the two of
us. I don't know what it is she's thinking right now, but based on the way
she's studying us so closely, I know I don't like it. “Well, then, Mr.
Smith…” She holds her hand out to grasp his. “Nice to meet you.”
“It's nice to meet you, Mrs. Kelly. I've heard wonderful things about
you from Lowell.” He nods toward where Miller and Collin ran off to. “I'm
going to go find my moronic teammate who I am very sorry about. He's
young. And dumb. Really, really dumb.”
Evelyn laughs, waving him off. “Please. He's fine. It makes an old lady
like me feel good.”
He grins at her, then disappears toward the pleas of help that are
definitely coming from Miller.
The moment he's out of earshot, she turns to me. “You two truly aren't
dating? Because that man is…wow.”
“I—no!” I laugh lightly, hoping it sounds convincing enough. “He's
just…a player.”
She hums again, and I still don't like the reaction. “Interesting.”
And I really don't like that one.
“Well, never mind,” she says, linking her arm in mine. “Come sit next
to me. Lowell was just telling us all how he and Hollis met.”
Hollis groans, and we all laugh, knowing the story already. Lowell dives
back in where he left off, and by the time he's finished, dinner is ready.
We pile into the dining room, and I can't help but laugh at how detailed
Harper got with everything. Sitting on each plate is a little Santa-shaped
name tag. I guess given her career that utilizes her insanely amazing artistic
abilities, I'm not surprised she got all crafty with this.
I find my name and go to pull my chair out, but it's already being done
for me. I glance up to see Smith.
“For you,” he says quietly.
“Thank you,” I murmur back.
Then, even though his name isn't on the card, he takes the seat next to
me and reaches over to switch his and Miller's Santa nameplates. When he
turns back to me, I lift my brow at him.
“What?” he says innocently. “I saved you. You're welcome.”
I sputter out a laugh because he's not wrong.
Miller waltzes into the room and pulls his chair out next to Smith. He
takes a seat, then turns to the big giant. Looking him square in the eyes, he
says, “I just want you to know that if you try to hold my hand, I will let
you.”
Smith just looks at him. “Duly noted.”
I tuck my lips together, trying not to laugh at the exchange, but it's no
use. A small sound escapes me and has Smith turning his heated stare my
way, which makes me laugh harder.
“Don't encourage him.”
Miller's face pops around Smith's head. “No, please. Encourage me. I
like it.” He bounces his brows up and down.
If the look Smith gave him before was dark, this one is murderous.
I know then that it's going to be a long night.
12
SMITH
Collin and Rhodes are deep in a conversation about the season, and
Lowell's pretending he's not listening for any sign of Hollis needing him.
Miller is…well, he's lucky he's alive, that's for sure.
I glare over at him. He's been flirting with Emilia all night, and I could
wring his neck for it.
I won't lie, it was painful sitting next to her all through dinner. It's
easily the longest I've been so close to her in over two years. I had to stop
myself no less than three times from reaching out and touching her…
holding her hand…kissing her.
But there was no way I was going to let Miller sit next to her. I probably
would have killed him. Hell, I still might kill him just for the hell of it.
“I'm grabbing another beer. Does anyone want anything while I'm up?”
he announces, rising from the couch.
I jump up after him. “No way you're going in there alone.”
“What? Why not?”
“Um, probably because you keep hitting on Mrs. Kelly.” And what's
mine—Emilia. Though I don't say that part aloud.
“Uh, her name is Evelyn,” Miller says, rolling his eyes.
It doesn't help his case at all.
“I'm going with you,” I say to him.
“Well, I'm going too. I need to check on Hollis.” Lowell hops up,
jumping ahead of us both.
“Wow.” Rhodes shakes his head, then drains the last of his beer. “You're
all a bunch of pathetic losers. But I'm out of beer, so I guess I'll go check in
with Ryan.”
“Yeah, I think I heard Harper call my name for sure.” Collin grabs an
empty bottle from the table and stands.
It's like they're all in a silent agreement that they miss being near their
women, but none of them will fess up to it.
We pad across the house but stop short when Collin holds his hand up,
motioning for us to get into formation like we're part of the military or
something. I kind of feel like we are as we shamelessly eavesdrop.
“I like him. I really, really like him. And he is going to be an amazing
father to your baby, Hollis,” Evelyn says about Lowell.
Rhodes claps Lowell on the shoulder, grinning at him. The guy smiles
less often than I do—and that's really saying something—but we all know
how important it was for Lowell to be accepted by Hollis' mom. It's all he's
been talking about at the rink for the last week. He's been sweating bullets,
but I knew he had no reason to be worried. Lowell is a good guy, and Hollis
is lucky to have him as the father of her child.
“Honestly?” she continues. “I'm just glad it's not Thad. That man was a
total douchebag. I can still say that, right?”
“Oh my gosh, thank you!” Emilia agrees with her, and I can imagine her
throwing her hands in the air, her red hair that's always up in a damn
ponytail holder bouncing around with the movement. “I have been saying
that for years! He gave me such bad vibes.”
“He really did. He reminded me of your father, actually,” Evelyn tells
her daughter.
“I had no idea that was what you thought about him, Mom,” Hollis says.
“I didn't want to say anything because I knew how much you loved
him, and you seemed happy. I thought maybe it was just my own
insecurities about my marriage falling apart, and I didn't think it would be
fair to put that on your relationship. In the end, it turned out I was right, and
that's the last thing I ever wanted. I know you girls think I'm overprotective
and all I want to do is smother you, and while that may be partially true, I
do it because I love you more than anything and only want what's good for
you. I hope you'll understand that soon too. I can tell your man out there
with the cute butt does.”
I glance over to find his wide eyes glistening under the soft hallway
lighting. It's crazy to see how much he's changed since this past summer.
Hell, it's crazy to see how much Collin and Rhodes have changed too,
but love does that to you. It turns you into someone else. If you're lucky,
it's a good someone else. If you're unlucky…it can do so much more harm
than good.
And that's what I'm afraid of—losing everything for a good time that
doesn't last. I'm not sure I'm willing to risk it. It's the reason I haven't
given myself to anything other than hockey. People let me down. Hockey
doesn't, at least not in the same way.
“All right, who is in here talking about my cute butt again?” Collin
announces as he rounds the corner.
We follow closely behind him, filing into the kitchen one by one.
Emilia's eyes track mine as I grab fresh beers from the fridge, passing them
out to the guys. I point to a bottle of wine, silently asking her if she wants
another glass. She nods and I pour her one, sliding it her way.
Our fingertips brush around the glass, and while everyone else is too
busy to notice the hitch in her breath, I'm not.
I don't miss it because I fucking felt it too.
That charge. That spark.
She downs half the glass in one drink.
“Just because someone mentions a nice butt, doesn't mean they are
talking about yours.” Harper pats her husband's cheek, pulling our
attention.
He snorts. “Right. Sure.”
“They could be talking about mine.” Miller turns around, jutting his
backside out for all to see.
“I can assure you, it was not your ass,” Emilia deadpans, glancing down
at it anyway.
Yep. He's dying.
“Rude. I think for that, you owe me a present.”
Miller glares at her, not noticing that I'm shooting the same fucking
look his way, but Emilia sees it, and it's enough to have her throwing back
the rest of her drink.
“Is that your way of asking if we can do gifts now?” Harper asks.
He folds his hands under his chin. “Please, Mom?”
She rolls her eyes. “Fine, let's go. Everyone to the big room.”
“All right, don't everyone fight over sitting next to me,” Miller says,
leading the pack. He throws his arm around Emilia, winking at her.
“Especially you, gorgeous.”
She rolls her eyes but doesn't make a move to push him off. Is she
fucking doing this to me on purpose? Does she want me to lose my mind?
We all gather around the tree Harper and Collin have set up in their big,
open entertainment room. It's one hundred percent them—a black tree with
red lights decked out in horror-themed ornaments. The “star” is Freddy
Krueger's knife glove. It would be weird in any other home, but since
they're both horror-obsessed, it works.
Miller tugs Emilia down next to him, and she just allows it.
She fucking allows it.
My blood is boiling. I feel so damn stupid for wanting to march over
there and stake my claim in front of everyone, for wanting to scream She's
mine.
But she's not mine. Hell, I haven't even kissed her in over two years.
I want to, though. I really fucking want to.
“I'm going to grab more wine,” Emilia says, rising from the couch and
heading for the kitchen.
Miller juts his bottom lip out, pouting when she walks from the room.
“I'll go too.”
He tries to follow, and I shove him back down. “Not happening.” I
scowl at him. “I'll go.”
I don't leave any room for him to argue or for anyone to question my
motives. I follow behind Emilia and find her in the kitchen, her back to me
as she reaches into the fridge for a new bottle of wine. She sets it on the
counter but doesn't make a move to open it. Instead, she rests her hands on
the countertop and hangs her head.
She looks worn out and tired, and the only thing I want to do is walk
over there and make her feel better.
Maybe it's the alcohol making me feel more daring or maybe I'm just
an idiot, either way, I cross the kitchen.
I can tell the moment she realizes I'm standing behind her. Her body
shifts and she stands up straight, but she doesn't tell me to leave. She
doesn't tell me to get away. She just stands there.
Almost like she's waiting.
I shouldn't be doing this. Shouldn't be standing this close to her.
But I can't help it.
I have to touch her.
She doesn't stop me when I reach out and fit my hand around her waist.
She doesn't stop me when I tug her back against me or when I drop my lips
to her exposed neck, not even when I press a kiss there.
A tiny moan escapes her. It's soft, nearly not a noise at all, but I hear it
anyway.
Before I can talk myself out of it, I spin her in my arms and lift her,
dropping her onto the counter.
“Smith…”
I step between her legs, taking her face in my hands. I slide one hand
through her hair, gently tugging the ponytail holder free. Her red curls
cascade down her back and over her shoulders.
I lean back to admire her. She looks like a fucking angel sitting there
staring up at me with her lips slightly parted and eyes full of lust.
“Fucking perfect.”
A small gasp leaves her lips when I repeat the same words to her from
our first night together.
“What… What are you doing?”
“Reminding you who you belong to.”
Then I crush my mouth to hers. She stills for only a moment before
melting into me, and I tug her closer, swallowing the low moan that escapes
her and deepening the kiss.
It's heaven. She tastes like heaven. Just like I remember.
No—better.
Her lips are soft and sweet and absolutely fucking perfect, just like the
way she fits against me is perfect.
I slide my hands through her hair, dragging my fingers through the long,
silky strands, and I'm flooded with memories of how good it felt wrapped
around my fist as she sank to her knees in front of me.
I pull her closer, her legs going around my waist, and there's no
mistaking the evidence of what she's doing to me…or of what I'm doing to
her.
Having her against me again…it feels entirely too fucking good. I want
to yank her off this counter and carry her to a bedroom and have my way
with her.
Hell, I don't even want to do that much. Right here in this kitchen, I
want to slide her panties aside and plunge my cock deep inside her, want to
see if her pussy still feels like the perfect fit.
I keep one hand wrapped in her hair, the other moving to her thigh,
where I slowly slide my hand under her dark green skirt. It's one of the few
times I'm glad she's wearing one. I don't waste any time—because I have
no idea how long this moment will last—and run the back of my knuckle
right over the soaked spot on her panties.
She whimpers against my mouth, her hands clawing at my biceps,
trying to get closer. Her body slides against the counter, searching for any
sort of friction she can get.
I oblige. I press my knuckle harder against her, finding her clit, and I'm
so fucking glad I'm kissing her so I can swallow the loud moan that leaves
her.
I'm so wrapped up in her that I nearly miss the footfalls in the hallway.
She doesn't though. She goes stiff in my arms, wrenching her mouth
away from me. Her eyes, full of fear, flick to mine. She's on the counter not
facing the hall, but I can see over her shoulder.
“Is someone there?” she whispers, too scared to turn around and see for
herself.
“No.”
And thank fuck too.
We'd be screwed. There's no way we would be able to explain this to
someone.
“Oh, thank gosh,” Emilia mutters, dropping her head against my chest.
I don't know who was just heading this way, but I'm glad they turned
around.
I'm not sure I'm ready for repercussions of this. Which just proves even
more that this is a stupid idea.
A stupid idea that feels really, really good.
When my own breathing returns to normal, I tip her face up to mine,
hating how her bottom lip is trapped between her teeth in worry.
“That was…” She swallows, and I already know I'm going to hate her
next words. “A mistake,” she finishes. “W-We shouldn't have done that.”
She's wrong.
She knows she's wrong too. Maybe this wasn't the place, but doing
that…it was inevitable.
She shoves at my chest, and I step away, allowing her to slide off the
counter. She brushes her hands through her hair, smoothing her clothes back
down. She runs the back of her hand across her lips like she's trying to rub
away the kiss, but it's no use. Her lips are swollen and used, and she looks
every bit like she's been kissed.
“I… We… We can't do that again, Smith.”
“I know.”
“I mean it.”
“I know.”
She nods, her lip back between her teeth. “I…okay.” Another nod. “All
right. I'm…I'm going back out there.”
Now it's my turn to nod. “Okay.”
She moves past me, and I reach out, wrapping my hand around her wrist
to stop her.
“Smith…”
It's not my name, not really. It's a plea. She wants me to let her go, but
the truth is, I'm not so sure I can.
And I don't know how to feel about that.
“Wine,” I croak out.
“Huh?”
“You came in here for the wine. Don't forget the wine.”
“Oh.” She marches back past me, grabbing the bottle, then turning back
my way. She mutters a quiet “Thanks” as she disappears back to the party.
I don't know if it was for the reminder or the kiss.
All I know is…I am so screwed.

EMILIA & SMITH
Emilia: I'd like to set up a day where our film crew can follow
you around your apartment when you get back.
Emilia: We did this with Woodworth last year, and the fans
loved seeing glimpses into his life outside of the rink.
Smith: Well, hello to you too.
Emilia: Sorry. In work mode.
Emilia: Hi.
Smith: This being-followed-around thing…do I have to?
Emilia: Yes.
Smith: Okay, fine.
Smith: But I'll probably complain about it the entire time.
Emilia: I'll make a note of that.
Smith: Can you also make a note that I'm being forced to do
this stupid player profile? I'd like a content warning before
every video, please.
Emilia: No.
Emilia: Also, you're extra sassy today. Did someone piss in
your cereal?
Smith: I drew the short stick and have to sit next to Miller
during travel today.
Emilia: Wait…do you guys really draw sticks to see who has
to sit next to him?
Smith: Yes.
Emilia: OMG!
Emilia: That is so mean!
Smith: You've met Miller, yeah? He's exhausting on a good
day.
Emilia: Okay, fine. That's fair.
Emilia: Sorry you have to endure that.
Smith: Trust me, I'm sorry too.
Emilia: Try headphones?
Smith: Did. They don't work. He keeps talking.
Emilia: Sleeping?
Smith: Also doesn't work. He just talks and talks and talks.
Even when I pretend to sleep, he still talks, and I can just
FEEL him there, so I can never actually fall asleep.
Emilia: Have you tried kneeing him in the nuts?
Smith: That would be breaking dude code, so no.
Emilia: Protect all nuts, not just your own?
Smith: Are we really discussing my nuts right now?
Emilia: No. We're discussing Miller's.
Emilia: I'm glad this is on my personal phone and not the
company's.
Smith: That wouldn't be awkward at all.
Smith: He's still talking, by the way.
Emilia: What's he even going on about?
Smith: Right now, he's listing the acting credentials for
Leonardo DiCaprio.
Smith: Just a few minutes ago he was detailing the timeline of
STAR WARS. I have no idea how he's made this jump.
Smith: I'm exhausted and in desperate need of a nap before
the game tonight.
Emilia: Go nap so you can win.
Emilia: Oh, and let me know what day works best for you for
the player profile.
Smith: I already told you, none of them.
Emilia: And I already told you, too bad.
Smith: You're about as annoying as Miller.
Emilia: YOU TAKE THAT BACK, OWEN MITCHELL SMITH!
Smith: Cancel the player profile.
Emilia: What's that?? You want to do not one but TWO TikTok
dances?
Smith: *glares*
Emilia: Oh no, I'm oh SO terrified.
Emilia: ^Pure sarcasm, by the way.
Smith: Yeah, I caught that.
Smith: Okay, fine. We can do it the day after I get back since
we're off for two days. Happy?
Emilia: About the profile? Yes. About you insulting me? No.
Smith: I apologize that I called Miller annoying. He's like, the
HOTTEST guy on the team. Nobody with that great of an ass
can be annoying. It's statistically impossible.
Emilia: I'm really not sure you know how statistics work, Miller.
Emilia: Also, looking forward to seeing your black eye during
the game tonight.
Smith: What bla
Smith: Sorry. Clearly Miller stole my phone.
Smith: I'm going to go murder him now.
Emilia: I'll allow it.
Emilia: I was kidding about Miller's black eye, but I'm pleased
to see he was in fact sporting a fat lip.
Smith: Little shit stain deserved it too.
Smith: Can you tell me why the guys are sending me memes?
Emilia: Memes?
Smith: Yeah, you know, those funny pictures people make
and post on social media.
Emilia: I know what a damn meme is, Smith. I'm asking you
WHAT memes they're sending you.
Smith: Oh.
Smith: Memes of me. During arrival photos.
Emilia: Oh. That.
Smith: Yeah, THAT. You knew?
Emilia: I've…seen some.
Smith: Okay, but WHY are they happening?
Emilia: It kind of went viral in the hockey community. It's all
over.
Smith: I'm viral??
Emilia: Yep. Great exposure for the team. Not so much for
you.
Smith: What's so great about the photo?
Emilia: I guess it's because of the intense look in your eyes.
You looked like you were ready to murder someone.
Smith: I was.
Smith: The other team, of course.
Emilia: Of course.
Emilia: Also…the comments didn't help the situation.
Smith: THERE ARE COMMENTS?!
Smith: Okay, wow. I just read some of them on the team's
Instagram.
Emilia: Do you even have an Instagram account??
Emilia: The team is required to follow you if you do.
Smith: I do now, but I don't intend to use it any. I'll probably
delete it, especially after reading some of that…stuff.
Smith: Should I respond to them?
Emilia: NO! Never respond to the comments!
Emilia: Actually, don't even read them. Rule number one of
the internet is to not even READ the comments. They're
dangerous.
Smith: They're…something.
Smith: A lot of people were calling me daddy.
Emilia: It's a compliment.
Emilia: You should have seen the ones we deleted.
Smith: There were MORE???
Emilia: Yes. Some are quite detailed. Reading them was…
something.
Smith: All because of a picture??
Emilia: Welcome to the internet, old man.
Smith: *glares*
Smith: I'm not THAT old.
Emilia: Whatever you say, gramps.
Smith: Emilia…
Emilia: Owen…
Smith: You don't do that often.
Smith: Call me Owen, I mean.
Emilia: Oh.
Emilia: You're right. I don't. I guess I never really thought
about it.
Emilia: You've been Smith since we met.
Smith: That's fair, I guess.
Emilia: Do you…want me to call you Owen?
Smith: Yes.
Smith: No.
Smith: I'm not really sure, honestly.
Emilia: I can see that.
Emilia: Is it weird being called by your last name all the time?
Smith: Likely nothing different than what military personnel
experience, though sometimes it makes me feel like two
different people.
Emilia: Which one is the real you? Smith or Owen?
Smith: Which one do you like better?
Emilia: Some days? Neither.
Emilia: But other days? I like them both.
Smith: I'll make a note of that.
Emilia: You do that.
Emilia: Good luck tonight.
Smith: Thanks.
Emilia: What are some of your hobbies?
Smith: I don't really have any.
Emilia: None??
Emilia: Puzzles count as a hobby, especially as much as you
do it. I already have that listed, so I need a few more,
something to build off of for content.
Smith: I don't puzzle anymore.
Emilia: WHAT? Why not??? You loved it!
Smith: Lost interest.
Emilia: Hmm. That's…sad. You seemed to really use it to help
you unwind.
Emilia: You didn't replace it with anything?
Smith: Not really.
Emilia: So what do you do when you're not at the rink?
Smith: Wish I was.
Emilia: Come on. Give me something here.
Smith: I don't know, Emilia. I eat, sleep, and breathe hockey.
That's pretty much all I do.
Emilia: That can't be ALL. I get that hockey is a full-time job,
but there's no way it takes up all of your time.
Smith: Sometimes I volunteer down at the hospital.
Emilia: I know. I cover those.
Smith: No. Outside of the team events.
Emilia: Wait…really???
Smith: Yeah. Keeps me busy.
Emilia: That's… I didn't know that.
Smith: Not really something I do for the accolades, so I don't
advertise it.
Emilia: That's really something, Owen.
Smith: I'd like to keep that out of the profile if we could.
Emilia: Of course.
Emilia: I'll figure something else out.
Emilia: Thank you.
Smith: You're welcome.
Smith: See you tomorrow?
Emilia: Tomorrow.

EMILIA
“Wow!” Blake whistles, tipping his head back to stare up at the massive
building in front of us. “This is…a lot to take in.”
We're currently standing outside Smith's apartment building.
The same one I was in two years ago.
The same one where he laid me bare and made me feel like I've never
felt before.
And somehow, I have to walk inside and act like I've never been here.
Like I didn't fall to my knees in his entryway. Like he didn't take me
against his kitchen counter and have me for breakfast. Like I wasn't pressed
against the window and fucked from behind for the whole city to see.
And like we didn't just slip up two weeks ago at Christmas.
I have to act like none of that ever happened…all while a film crew is
here.
“You know, my best friend, Carsen, grew up wealthy and Nate and I
lived with him in college, but even his place wasn't as grand as this. This is
definitely NHL money here.”
“Just wait until you see the inside.”
The words slip out before I even realize what I've just said.
“You've seen it?” Blake asks, not missing it at all.
“Oh, uh…sort of? Pictures,” I lie, and I hate how easily those are
beginning to pass from my lips. “I've seen photos from the girls.”
“Ah, that makes sense.” Blake nods. “Well, come on. Let's get this stuff
set up and get started on filming. I'm sure we're losing good lighting or
whatever it is film people say.”
He leads the way into the building like he's the one who has been here
before, and I, along with the crew, follow behind.
I'm trying hard to control my breathing as we pile into the elevator.
Being back here is hard.
Being back here after Smith kissed me at Christmas is even harder.
Because now it's not just a memory from two years ago, not when I can
still feel his lips on mine.
The guys have been on a six-game road trip, and I've been so happy for
the two-week reprieve. Truthfully, I'm scared of seeing Smith again. I
almost canceled, but I knew I would have to dodge a million and one
questions from Blake on why.
So, here I am, trapped in an elevator with him and three other guys on
our camera crew as we make our way to the top floor. The elevator chimes
as we arrive, and my heart feels like it's beating a million times a second,
like it's going to leap out of my chest and fall on this elevator floor and
everybody's going to know what happened between us.
It's ridiculous, I know it is, but I'm nervous.
The doors open and I hold my breath, counting the steps it takes to
make it to his door.
Ten.
I count the seconds it takes for him to open it.
Eight.
And I count the seconds it takes for his eyes to meet mine.
Four.
I brace myself…waiting for what, I don't know.
But…nothing happens. There is nothing in Smith's eyes when he looks
at me. It's like he didn't just have his tongue in my mouth or have me
pinned against a counter where if we hadn't been interrupted, who knows
how far it would have gone.
Hell, he hardly looks at me at all.
“Good morning, Mr. Smith!” Blake says cheerfully, clapping his hands
together. He's a total morning person, and as seen at the rink, the grumpy
hockey player in front of us is not.
Based on the grunt that leaves Smith, I can see that hasn't changed
much.
Blake just laughs it off as Smith opens the door wider, letting us all into
his expansive apartment. When I walk past, I try to make eye contact, but
he refuses to meet my stare.
Frankly, it pisses me off, because seriously…he's blowing me off?!
I shouldn't be upset. I really shouldn't considering the kiss should have
never happened, but it stings in a way I wasn't expecting.
“This is an incredible place you have here.” Blake spins in a circle,
taking in the dwelling I'm familiar with.
“Thanks,” Smith says quietly. “It's nothing like you'd get from Wright
or Rhodes, but it's all I got.”
He's definitely right about that. If we were shooting there, we would see
the touches of Ryan and Harper and the lives they're building together. This
is clearly a bachelor pad. There's next to no furniture, no real décor. It's all
very minimalistic and missing that touch to make it feel like a home.
“Still…” Blake laughs. “It's nicer than any place I'll ever have unless
Nate takes up stripping or something and starts raking in the dough.” He
tips his head, picturing that. “Never mind.” He points around the room.
“Nobody give him that idea. He's an awful dancer.”
We all laugh.
I've met Nate a few times during functions with the team, and it's
obvious they're madly in love with each other. Blake told me a bit of their
story, how they grew up best friends and didn't realize until college that
they were ready to take the next step in their relationship, how things were a
little touch and go with them for a while, but they've overcome it. Now,
after moving down here from Massachusetts to start fresh, they have a little
girl their friend Elliott helped bring into this world, and they're happier than
they've ever been.
When he told me the story, I was happy for him. Hell, I'm still happy
for him…and maybe a little jealous too.
But now isn't the time to dwell on what I don't have…even if he is in
the room with me.
“So, uh, where did you guys need to set up?” asks the man I can't seem
to get out of my head.
“Did Emilia run through what we're looking for today?”
Smith's eyes flick to mine for only a moment. “Kind of. Something
about my rest-day routine, right?”
“Pretty much, yeah,” Blake answers. “She can explain while we start
setting up the cameras and finding the best places for some shots for
lighting and everything.”
He and the camera operators head from the room toward the kitchen to
get to work. Hopefully, we can capture enough usable material in the next
few hours and won't have to come back here.
Smith looks pained as they go, leaving just the two of us alone together.
There's a hushed silence that falls over the room, and I don't know what to
say to him. It seems like he doesn't know what to say to me either, so we
stand there in uncomfortable silence for far too long.
So long that I can't stand it and I blurt out the first thing that comes to
mind. “How was your road trip?”
It's a stupid question, so I'm not surprised when he pins me with a dark
stare.
“We lost. A lot.”
I nod because I know they did. I read the comments the fans left; they
weren't pretty, but I don't tell him that.
This feels awkward being here with him, and I'm not entirely sure why.
We texted a few times while he was gone to set up this interview, and
everything was cordial. It seemed like maybe we could move past what
happened.
But this? Being here in this apartment with him when it holds so many
memories? It doesn't seem like we've moved past anything. It's like so
many more floodgates have been opened and I'm starting to drown,
desperate for land right now.
I clear my throat. “Right. So, uh, for today…we just want to follow you
around and see what it is you get up to on a rest day. For some reason, the
fans are more curious about that than game days. I think it just kind of
makes you more…real to them. Little more normal and less of a hockey
superstar.”
He snorts. “I'm not a hockey superstar. I'm practically a washed-up old
man by now. Most people won't remember my name whenever I leave this
league.”
My chest aches for him because he sounds so certain, like he actually
believes that, and I can't understand why. Sure, he doesn't have the same
numbers as McDavid, Ovechkin, or Crosby, but he's an incredible player in
his own right. I just wish he'd see that.
Now isn't the time for me to stroke his ego, though. It's time for work,
and that's what we're going to do.
“Okay, well, let's start with meals since it's always a question that gets
asked. Show us what you can do in the kitchen.”
For the first time since I stepped foot in his apartment, he looks at me
for more than two seconds. With the one look, I know exactly what's going
through his mind, because the last time I was here, he definitely showed me
what he can do in the kitchen…and I was his meal.
Ignoring his heated expression, I spin on my heel, only to come to a
complete stop. Hanging above the fireplace isn't a TV like you'd normally
see in someone's house.
No.
It's our puzzle. The one we left unfinished on the table when our clothes
became a distraction.
He kept it.
I stare up at the castle, the same one I told him I wanted to see one day
as I regaled him with plans of a trip to Europe I'm almost certain I'll never
get to take. I'm lost in the landscape, taken back to a time when I wasn't
worried about who he is, just how he made me feel. If it wasn't for the
warmth that spreads through me, I wouldn't notice when he steps up behind
me.
He's standing so close I can feel him, even though he's not touching me.
“There were a lot of things about that weekend left unfinished, but I
couldn't bear to leave that the same way,” he says in a low, deep voice, his
lips nearly brushing my ear.
Then he steps away from and around me. This time, it's his turn to walk
away.
“How's my baby doing?”
Hollis' laughter fills my car. “You always have to ask about my baby
first, huh?”
“Well, yeah, have to make sure my little angel is doing okay.”
“You say angel, I say demon.”
“Uh-oh.” I frown at the exhaustion laced in her words. “Still having
morning sickness?”
“Oh yeah. You do not want to know how many times I've thrown up
today.”
She's been struggling with it throughout the entire pregnancy, and I hate
it for her.
“But enough about me and my struggles,” she says. “I was just calling
to see how you are. I know I just saw you at Christmas, but it feels like it's
been forever.”
To say Tori has been on my ass about getting the player profile started
would be an understatement. I tried to explain to her that I'm trying to
respect their game schedule and Smith's personal time, but she wasn't
having any of it. Part of me wonders if she can see through that and can tell
that, especially since Christmas, I really don't want to spend time with
Smith. I don't trust myself around him. A few minutes alone in the kitchen
on Christmas Day proved that to be a valid concern.
“I'm sorry,” I tell Hollis. “I promise to be back to begging you to hang
out soon—if you have time for me, that is. You know, when you're not
bumping uglies with your baby daddy.”
She groans at my words, but I still hear the smile in the sound. Things
with her and Lowell seem to be going okay after Christmas, and I'm happy
for them. Lowell has always been a great guy.
“Speaking of hot hockey players…how's it going with Smith? Who, by
the way, I still can't believe agreed to do the profile,” Hollis says. “He's
even more private than Lowell, and that's saying something.”
I laugh because she's right. After working with Lowell for the last
couple of years, it's safe to say he is indeed private. Hell, I think only about
five of his teammates have ever even been to his house. Any time he has his
captain's duties and has to host a dinner or something, he either has it at a
restaurant or rents an Airbnb.
He's probably one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet and he'd do
anything to help a friend, but emotionally? That man is a brick wall. I've
heard whispers that it's because of a past relationship gone bad, but I've
never dug deeper into it.
“Things with Smith are…” Complicated. Weird. Tense. Electric.
“They're fine.”
“Just fine?” she presses, and guilt nibbles at me. Hollis still has no clue
about our history, and right now, when she's already stressed to the max
about having a baby with her one-night stand, I'd rather not throw all the
sordid details at her.
Besides, nobody can know. I have a promotion to protect.
“Yep. Blake and I actually just wrapped up shooting some content at his
apartment. It took way longer than I wanted, but oh well.”
We planned to be in and out by lunch, but after some battery issues and
other things that came up, we got started late. It's nearly five now, and I'm
just heading home.
“Hmm…”
“What are you hmm-ing me for?”
“Nothing. It's just…” She trails off, then sighs. “I don't know. I thought
there might be something between you two. You disappeared at Christmas
together, and then when you came back, your hair was down, and you left
rather quickly after that.”
“We were just talking, and I wanted to get out of there before I started
drinking too much, which was where I was headed dealing with Miller's
advances. Just being safe.” Lies, lies, lies. “Besides, there are rules against
staff and players having relationships, you know.”
I don't know if I'm reminding her or myself.
“Yeah, but who has to know, right?” She laughs.
I laugh too, hoping it doesn't sound too forced.
Because…she kind of has a point. Who has to know, right?
No, no, no. Stop that, Emilia. Don't even go there.
“Only kidding,” she says, pulling me back to the conversation. “Well,
kind of. Oof.”
“Everything okay?” I ask.
“Ugh. Yeah, just gassy. Pregnancy farts are a bitch.”
“Yeah, no thanks on that.”
“Trust me, never get knocked up. You'll regret it.”
But even as she says the words, I know she's lying. She might hate
being pregnant sometimes, but she is already madly in love with her baby,
and I really can't wait to watch that love grow once the baby is here.
“We're still planning the baby shower for All-Star weekend, right? You
requested off?” she asks.
“Yep. Blake's taking care of everything, so I'm all yours.”
“Yay! I'll—” I hear a faint knock through the speaker. “Oh crap, my
dinner is here. Hang on.”
She grunts, and I can imagine her pulling herself with her swollen belly
off the couch. I listen as she unlatches the door, then pulls it open.
“Special dicklivery for one hot piece of ass.”
I can't help it—I burst out laughing as Lowell's words filter through the
speaker.
“Oh my gosh,” Hollis mutters. “You think it sounds bad, but it's worse
—he just humped the air.”
“Are you sure that's not Miller?”
“Are you on speaker? Is that Emilia?” The mortification is clear in his
voice. “Fuck,” he curses, and I laugh again. “Pretend you didn't hear that,
Emilia, and I'll do whatever TikTok video you want me to!”
“Any?” I ask, my mind already spinning.
“Within reason.”
“It's a deal,” I say. “Hollis, I love you, but I don't want to be here while
you get your dicklivery, so I'm going to go.”
“Bye! I love you!” she says.
Before I can press end, I hear, “Come here, darlin'. I get to eat first.”
Her squeal is cut off when the call ends, and I'm thankful for it.
And maybe a little jealous.
I wish I could have something that easy. Well, their situation isn't
exactly easy, but still. At least she can have what she wants. Me? I'm stuck
wanting what I can't have.
Another call comes in, and I press the green button.
“Oh, thank gosh!” Blake's panicked voice comes over the speaker
before I even have a chance to greet him.
“Everything okay?”
“Yes—well, no. Listen, don't hate me, but…” He hesitates. “I kind of
left the laptop with all the footage on it at Smith's, and I have dinner
reservations with Nate and our surrogate and her husband tonight.”
I groan. “And you need me to go get it because those files need to be
sent to editing ASAP.”
He sucks air in through his teeth. “Yeah, that.”
“I think I might murder you, Blake.”
“Well, that's rude.”
“Is it though?”
“Incredibly. But also a little justified.” He pauses. “Is there any way you
can do me a solid? I'll owe you. Big time.”
“It's fine. You're already covering All-Star weekend for me. I can grab
the laptop and get the stuff sent over. We'll be square?”
“Really?” He lets out a relieved sigh. “Thank you. So much. You're the
best.”
“Yeah, yeah, I know. Have a good dinner.”
“Kisses!” He blows them through the phone, and I end the call.
I was almost home, almost to a glass of wine I so desperately need.
Instead, I whip a U-turn and make my way back to Smith's apartment.
After sitting in traffic for far too long, I'm officially annoyed. I could
wring Blake's neck for this. But then again, it's not like I had any plans
tonight. I was just going to order Chinese and sip my way through a whole
bottle of wine. Now, I think I'll skip the wine and just eat ice cream for
dinner in the bathtub.
When I pull up to his building, it seems even bigger than it did just a
little bit ago. Darker. More intimidating. I chalk it up to coming back here
alone.
In and out. Just grab the laptop and leave, Emilia.
I swallow down my nerves and climb out of the car. I do every
breathing exercise I can possibly remember as the elevator takes me back to
the top floor and my feet carry me to his door.
I knock.
Then wait.
There's a shuffle from the other side, and when he pulls the door open,
his head tips to the side.
“Emilia.”
“Smith.”
We don't say anything else.
We just stand there for several seconds, eyes locked, neither of us
moving, neither of us breathing.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
“Do you want to come in?”
I should say no.
I know that. It's right there on the tip of my tongue.
But it's not what comes out at all.
“Okay.”
And I walk over the threshold.
15
SMITH
I'll be honest, I wasn't completely surprised to see Emilia when I pulled my
door open. I spotted the laptop on my countertop not long after they left…
and I admittedly prayed it would be her who came back for it.
It looks like my prayers were answered.
She steps into my apartment, the door making a hushed snick as I close
it behind her. She hesitates for only a moment in the foyer before carrying
herself farther into the living room, shoulders pressed back like she's trying
to will some confidence into herself. Her red hair is still swept up into a
messy bun, and I have the urge to reach over and pull it free, let it tumble
down her back the way I like it.
Her steps falter in the middle of the room, eyes going to the puzzle
hanging over the fireplace.
I meant what I said to her earlier about it. When I walked back into my
apartment all alone on the night she left, that puzzle was sitting on the table
taunting me. I didn't touch it though. I couldn't for some reason. It didn't
feel right to just get rid of something we'd done together. It felt like I was
trying to get rid of her when all I wanted to do was hold on for dear life.
So, it sat there for months unfinished and untouched. My housekeepers
were thoroughly annoyed with me, but I didn't care. I just let it collect dust
and soak in all the memories of our weekend together.
Then, we went back to the rink for preseason, and I was introduced to
the team's newest social media manager.
Her.
That night when I got home, I almost threw it away. I had the trash can
there, ready to scoop the pieces inside and never look at it again.
But I couldn't.
So, I finished it. Stayed up way too fucking late doing it and was nearly
late to practice the next day, but I completed it.
It's been hanging in that same spot since. Maybe I'm an idiot for
keeping it and being constantly reminded of what happened between us, but
I don't regret it—especially not seeing the look on her face now.
“Would you like something to drink?” I ask, and she jumps at my
words.
“Oh…uh…” She gives herself a shake. “I, uh, I'm here for a laptop.
Blake forgot to grab it. If I can get it, then I'll just be on my way.”
I lift a brow, amused by how she's stumbling over her words and how
she's not even looking at me.
She's nervous.
I like that she's nervous.
I step into her, tucking a knuckle under her chin and tipping her head up
until her eyes meet mine. “Have a drink with me, Emilia.”
“Okay.”
She says it so easily I'm not even sure she remembered to pretend to
resist. I don't give her time to realize though, pulling the jacket from her
shoulders and tossing it onto the couch before making my way to the
kitchen.
I try not to think about how I shouldn't be doing this. How I should just
hand her the laptop and send her on her way. How I shouldn't be tempting
fate more than I already am.
But it's one drink. There's no harm in that, right?
I work fast, grabbing a glass from the cabinet and pouring her wine,
then making my way back out to the living room. She's still standing in the
same spot, staring up at the castle. I hand her the wine, noting the way the
liquid shakes as she takes a healthy drink. I do the same, keeping my eyes
on hers.
“Did you go?” I ask. She raises her brows, and I nod toward the picture.
“The trip you wanted to take to Europe, the one you had all planned—did
you make it happen?”
She laughs quietly. “No. I got wrapped up in work.”
I frown, remembering how excited she was, how badly she wanted it,
how detailed her plans were. I hate that she never went. I hate that she never
got to experience everything she wanted.
I'll take you.
The words bounce around in my head, but I don't say them even though
I mean every single one…and I don't know how to feel about that. I don't
know how to feel about the fact that if I didn't have a game coming up, I'd
put our asses on a plane right now and we'd go anywhere she wanted to go.
I shouldn't want any of that. I have no right to it.
But I do.
She sighs. “Maybe one of these days I can do it. After I get the director
job possibly? A celebration trip of sorts.”
Even as she says it, I can tell she knows she's lying to herself. She
won't take that vacation on her own. She'll work herself to death first, and
while that makes me sad, I understand it. I've dedicated my entire life to
hockey, so I have no room to talk or judge.
“Yeah, maybe,” I mutter, taking a sip of my whiskey.
“What about you? What's the biggest or best trip you've ever been on?”
“This one.”
She tips her head. “This one?”
“Well, being from Canada, yeah, I consider this whole NHL thing one
big trip.”
“NHL thing,” she mutters, shaking her head and taking another sip of
her wine. “That's an interesting way to describe over fifteen years in the
league.”
I try not to think too hard about that reality, about how long I've been
playing. All it does is remind me that pretty soon, this will all be gone, and
I'll truly be alone.
“Uh-oh. Did I say something wrong?”
“Hmm?” I pull myself from my morbid thoughts, looking over at her.
Her brows are pinched together in concern. I shake my head. “No, it's
nothing. Just…thinking.”
“About retiring?”
My head snaps back. “We don't say the R-word.”
“My bad.” She laughs softly. “Is that what you're thinking about
though?”
It's no secret that my contract with the Comets is up this year, just like
the fact that I'm getting up there in age isn't a secret. Everyone knows after
this season, there's a real possibility of me never playing again.
“You could say it's been on my mind.” I run my hand over my beard.
“Is that why you wanted me for the player profile? Because this could be
my last year?”
“It was entirely decided by fan votes,” she says. “I promise that's the
only reason.”
I nod, believing her.
I wondered if this was some sort of pity thing from the team, like a Hey,
thanks for giving us your all for your entire career. You're still getting the
boot at the end of the season, but how about we make you feel just a little
bit special first type of deal.
I guess it's really not though.
I down the rest of my whiskey, then hold the empty glass up to her in a
silent question. She looks down at her still half-full glass of wine, shrugs,
and finishes it in one gulp.
I lead the way to the kitchen, where I set to work refilling both of our
drinks.
“Can I ask you something totally off the record?”
“Anything,” I say over my shoulder.
“Is this your last year?”
I swallow. I had a feeling that was what she was going to ask, but it's
the one question I can't really answer.
I go with something neutral. “It's not really up to me, is it?”
“No. I guess it's not,” she says quietly as I pass her a fresh glass of
wine. She rolls her lips together, like she is considering asking me
something else but is unsure if she can.
“Whatever it is that's going through your head, just ask.” I stand
opposite her, back pressed against the counter. “I'm an open book.”
She laughs and takes a sip of her wine, then sets it aside. “People have
called you many things over the years, Smith, but they've never called you
an open book.”
“With you I am.”
Her laughter fades quickly, and she looks to the side, a faraway gaze in
her eyes. I wonder if she's remembering our weekend together too, how we
shared so much with one another without sharing any of the basics.
Somehow, leaving out those details, it meant more. Where we work, our
names, where we live…those are just things about us. They don't make us.
Our dreams, how we fill our downtime, the things we yearn for…those
make us.
That weekend we spent together, that's exactly what we shared—our
real selves with zero expectations and zero preconceived notions.
She clears her throat. “Do you want to keep playing?”
In all my years of being in the NHL, I don't think anyone has ever asked
me that before…not even me. It's a question I've been scared to ask
because I'm scared of the answer.
Do I want to keep playing? There's a huge part of me that's screaming,
Yes! Of course! But there's also that lonely part of me…the one that's
pushed aside everything for hockey…that says no, says it's time to hang up
my skates and move on.
“I don't know,” I answer honestly. “Some days I wake up and crave the
game. Others, I wake up and crave something else…something…more.”
She nods like she understands, though I'm not sure she does because I
don't even understand.
I can't imagine not playing hockey, but I can't imagine doing anything
else either.
Hell, do I even have the skills to do anything else? Hockey is all I've
ever known, and I have no idea what I'm going to do whenever I am
actually done with the game.
“Owen?” I drag my gaze to hers. She's peering up at me, the green of
her eyes catching the setting sun just right as it filters through the big, open
windows that make up the west side of my apartment. “You're allowed to
want other things.”
“Am I?”
“Of course.” She gives me a lopsided smile. “You can have whatever
you want.”
There's a charge in the room, and the energy shifts as her words settle
around us.
I can't have whatever I want. She knows that as well as I do.
Her smile falters when I push off the counter and take a step her way.
“O-Owen…”
I take another step closer to her, even though I know I shouldn't. I
should be putting distance between us, not closing it, but I can't stop
myself.
“Not you, huh, Emilia?” She swallows when I take another step. “I can't
have you.”
Her tongue slides across her lips, her breaths coming in sharper as I get
closer to her.
She doesn't make a move to stop me, so I don't. I don't stop until I'm
standing mere inches away, until I can feel her chest brushing against me
with every heavy breath she draws in and pushes out. Her green eyes are
glassy and filled with so many questions, but even more than that, they're
filled with desire.
She wants this as badly as I do.
With one hand on her waist, I use the other to tug the clip that's holding
her hair up free, watching as her gorgeous red waves tumble down.
“You should wear your hair down more often.”
She nods, looking up at me like she'd do anything I asked her to.
I like that. I like having her at my mercy, like her desire to please me.
I slip my fingers through her hair, letting the strands tangle around my
fist. I tug her closer, her lips parting on a small gasp. She's practically
panting now, and I love it because I haven't even done anything yet, haven't
even really touched her.
But I want to.
I really, really fucking want to.
I know if we cross that line, though, there's no going back. There's no
stopping. If we start this, we're finishing it.
I can't walk away. Not again.
I need her to realize that too.
“Is this what you want?”
She nods.
“What did I tell you before?”
Her brows tighten for only a moment before her eyes spark with the
memory. “My words. Use my words.”
“Good girl.”
I feel her knees buckle when I say it, and I catch her, lifting her up and
setting her on the countertop. I step between her legs, loving the way I fit
there.
“Is this what you want?” I repeat, fingers still tangled in her hair.
“Yes.”
It's the single greatest word I've ever heard.
“Thank fuck,” I mutter, barely getting the words out before sealing my
mouth against hers.
She moans the moment our lips touch, and I swallow the sound. I tug on
her hair, tipping her head back to get just the right angle as our tongues
brush. I slide my hands from her hair and down her sides, tugging her shirt
free from that same fucking skirt that has starred in far too many of my
fantasies.
I break our kiss only to tug the simple navy-blue blouse over her head,
loving the way her red hair spills down her back as she sits there in just her
lacy black bra, her tits—which I know fit into my hands perfectly—
threatening to spill over the cups.
I admire her for only a beat, then reach behind her and undo her bra,
slipping the material down her arms and chucking it across the kitchen. I
have no clue where it lands, and I don't care.
All I care about is getting my mouth on her tits.
Fuck she looks like an angel sitting there, and I'd be a damn liar if I said
I didn't want to do bad, bad things to her. I bury my face against her chest,
and she groans when I close my mouth around her nipple, sucking on the
rosy bud with fervor, her hands crashing into my hair, holding me close.
I spend so long sucking on her tits that her groans turn into little
whimpers, and I know she wants more.
I want more too.
I wrench my shirt off over my head, then drop my fingers to the button
on my pants and unsnap them, lifting her off the counter and setting her on
her feet. I unzip her skirt, letting it pool at her feet.
“Leave them on,” I say as she goes to toe her heels off.
She looks up at me, almost looking like she wants to argue but thinks
better of it. Instead, she steps free of her skirt, leaving the black pumps in
place, standing before me in nothing but them and a black lace thong. Her
chest is red from my beard scratching against her, and it's heaving up and
down. She looks gorgeous.
But she'd look even better on her knees.
“Do you remember what we did before?” I ask. Her nostrils flare, and
she nods. “Good. Get on your knees and take my cock out, Emilia.”
She drops to the floor, her hands flying to my jeans.
The sound of the zipper running along the track is loud, but not as loud
as the sharp breath she sucks in when she tugs my jeans and underwear
down, my dick finally springing free.
I don't even have to tell her to drop her jaw, and I fucking love that. She
flattens her tongue, eager for me to fill her mouth, to use her.
So, I do.
I wrap her hair around my fist, and I slide my cock into her warmth,
loving the guttural moan that leaves her, loving the way she sucks me back,
like she's been waiting for this moment forever. Slowly, I push my cock to
the back of her throat until I'm as far in as she can take me.
“Look at me,” I tell her, tugging her hair. I use my other hand to stroke
my thumb over her jaw, helping her relax as I try to push in just a little
more.
Her eyes are glassy, and her face is turning just the lightest shade of red.
It's the most beautiful sight I've ever seen.
“You're doing such a good job,” I say. “Just perfect.”
Any tension she was holding melts away, and I'm able to work my cock
in just a few more centimeters before pulling out entirely. She gasps for air,
and I let her take it in.
Then, I do it again. Over and over she swallows my cock, taking more
and more each time. I can feel my orgasm lurking, and I don't want to come
in her mouth. Not this time.
I tug her to her feet, kissing her hard before spinning her around and
laying her face-first on the counter.
“Grip the other side,” I tell her, and she listens without hesitation.
I kick her feet apart and stand back. I don't need to slip my fingers
between her legs to know she's wet. I can see her arousal shining on the
inside of her thighs. But I do it anyway, pulling her thong to the side and
plunging two fingers inside of her.
“Fuck!” she cries out, bucking off the counter at the sudden intrusion.
“Oh god.”
I can't help but chuckle at the sounds leaving her, desperate and needy
and so fucking hot.
“Please, please, please,” she chants.
“Please what, Emilia?” I twist my fingers, rubbing against that elusive
spot I know drives her wild. “What do you want?”
“You!” she begs. “I want you!”
I reach into my back pocket with one hand and pluck my wallet free. I
grab the condom I had the forethought to put in there and rip the wrapper
open with my teeth, sheathing myself with one hand before pulling my
fingers from her greedy cunt.
She whimpers at the loss, but soon her cries turn into pleasured moans
as I sink into her. My pace is leisurely, a stark contrast to the way I was
fucking her with my fingers. I slowly work my cock in, letting her adjust to
my size.
When I'm fully seated, I have to take a breather. I'm so close to coming
just from the sheer relief of being inside her again.
Being with her feels like coming home. It feels right.
“Please, Owen. Move.”
I'm more inclined to give directions rather than take them, but I can't
find it in me to argue with her request. So, I fuck her slowly—almost
painfully so. I don't know how long this is going to be mine, so I'm going
to savor it.
She holds on to the counter tightly, pushing back to meet my thrusts,
letting me worship her at my leisure. I have no idea how long I do it. It feels
like seconds and minutes and hours. Somehow, it's still not long enough. It
will never be long enough, because being inside of her will never get old.
My balls tighten, and I know I'm getting close. If the way her breaths
are getting sharper and shorter is any indication, I know Emilia is too.
I can't hold back any longer—I slide my hand around her, pressing
fingers against her clit as I slam into her.
“Yes! God, yes!”
“Wrong name, sweetheart,” I say, slamming into her again.
Even with her heels still on, she's on her tiptoes, pushing back to meet
my hard thrusts. I rub tight circles on her clit, pumping my cock in and out
of her, and it's not long before I feel her legs shake, her pussy clenching
around me as she falls apart.
She goes limp on the counter, but I don't stop pounding into her,
chasing my own release. Not even a minute later, I find it, emptying myself
into the condom, wishing it was her.
I slow my thrusts as I come down from the high, running my hands over
her back, soothing her as she catches her breath. Then I gather her in my
arms, spinning her around and lifting her. She hooks her legs around my
waist, resting her head on my shoulder as I press kisses to her temple.
“You did so good, Emilia.”
She makes a contented sound as I carry her through the apartment to my
bathroom. I set her down on the bench in the walk-in shower, drag her
underwear down her legs, strip her heels from her feet, then get rid of the
condom. I turn the water on, letting it warm up, then pull her to her feet and
begin washing her hair.
We alternate between kissing and cleaning, but we don't speak. When
we're finished, I wrap her in a towel, then carry her to the bed. I bury us
beneath the covers, tugging her close to me until she's practically lying on
top of me.
Sleep has nearly claimed me when our silence is finally broken.
“Owen?” she says in the darkness of the room.
“Hmm?”
“Thank you.”
“Thank you.”
“You're welcome.”
I chuckle, then press a kiss to her head. “Sleep, Emilia. You're going to
need it.”
She laughs softly, and I swear I hear her say, “I can't wait.”

EMILIA
I'm on fire.
At least I feel like I'm on fire. There's sweat coating the back of my
neck, and I feel like my body is running at least ten degrees hotter than
normal.
And it's all because of Smith.
I'm plastered to his side, my head resting on his chest, and his arm is
holding me in place against him. I've been lying here for the last thirty
minutes running my hand through the hair on his torso, waiting for him to
wake up, waiting to see how he feels about last night.
I should feel a crushing weight of guilt right now. I'm sure somewhere
buried deep inside the dark crevices of my mind, it's just sitting there
waiting and ready to show its true weight—but in this moment, I don't feel
anything other than pure bliss.
This is everything that's been missing. Last night, it felt like I was
snapped back into reality.
I try not to think about the fact that I put my career in jeopardy last
night. If anyone were to find out about this…I'd be toast. Totally screwed.
I—
Smith stirs under my palm, and I hold my breath, waiting for him to
finally wake up. I'm dying to know what he's thinking. The rule of no
relationships doesn't just apply to me. It's on him too.
But nothing happens. He doesn't move.
I sigh. He laughs.
I gasp, trying to push up, but he tightens his hold, dragging me until I'm
all the way on top of him.
“You're awake!” I glare down at him.
His body rumbles with laughter. “I've been awake.”
“For how long?”
“Just a few minutes.” He dances his fingertips over my temple. “Your
loud thinking woke me up.”
I nibble on my bottom lip. “Sorry. It's just…I'm having thoughts.”
“About last night?”
I nod. “Yes.”
“That's understandable.” He rubs his thumbs into the small of my back,
and I hear him swallow. “Do you regret it?”
“No!”
And it's the truth. I don't regret last night. It was everything I could
have hoped for.
But that doesn't mean it was right.
“I don't regret it,” I say. “It's just…” I blow out a breath. “What the hell
are we doing, Smith?”
His dark brows furrow, and I'm not sure if it's my question that does it
or if it's me calling him Smith again.
I push off his chest, and this time he lets me move. I straddle him, trying
hard to ignore the way his dick stirs to life against my ass.
“I have a promotion. You have a contract. We know the rules. We—”
Smith presses his finger against my lips, cutting my words off. I pinch
my brows together in question.
“Do you remember that bubble we had before?” I nod, because of
course I do. I hated leaving it, but I had to. “Let's make a new one.”
“What do you mean?”
“I mean, when we're here together, it's just us having a good time.
That's it. Nothing else.”
“But—”
He presses his finger harder against my lips, shaking his head, and I roll
my lips in. He curls his hand over my waist, sliding it up my back and
pulling me down until I'm lying on his chest again, our mouths just inches
apart.
“We already know all the reasons it's wrong, Emilia,” he says, brushing
his nose against mine. “So, let's focus on all the reasons it's right.”
“Like?”
“Like the way you take my cock, for one.”
“Yes.”
The word slips free, and he chuckles, his laughter vibrating through my
whole body.
I don't know if I'm agreeing with him or asking him for it. Either way,
he lifts his hips, and said cock slips between my ass cheeks. I press back,
searching—no, yearning—for more.
I've never explored anal play before—my ex wasn't into it—but feeling
Smith back there…it feels good, and judging by the way his eyes flare
when I press back, he agrees.
I do it again, and his eyes darken.
“Is that what you want, Emilia? For me to play with your ass?”
A blush creeps up my cheeks, and I nod.
“Do you trust me?” he asks.
“Yes.” My answer is automatic, and it's honest. I know he'd never do
anything to hurt me.
“Good. Turn around. On your stomach.”
I do as he instructs, lying facedown. He straddles my legs, tracing his
hands over my back, then lower. His hands knead my cheeks, spreading me
and massaging me slowly, thumbs circling closer and closer to my
untouched hole with each pass.
I shiver at the anticipation, and he doesn't miss it, leaning forward to
pepper kisses across my back. His lips never leave me as he makes his way
lower, kissing every inch of my ass, continuing to massage me.
“Has anyone ever fucked you back here?” he asks.
“N-No,” I admit. “Nothing.”
He growls his approval, spreading me wider. “Good. Because I want it
first.”
I should be completely embarrassed by the pleasure-filled noise that
leaves me at the idea of him slipping into me where nobody else has ever
been, but I can't find an iota of a fuck to give.
I want it. I want him to have every part of me.
I let out a loud yelp when I feel something wet against my hole, and
then it hits me what it is—his tongue.
Oh god. Smith has his tongue on my asshole, and I love it. He rolls it
against me, kissing me in a spot I never in a million years imagined I'd
allow someone to go, and it feels incredible.
I have no idea how long he licks at me, but it's enough to have me
squirming and needing more.
“You're incredible,” he says, pulling away, and I already miss his mouth
on me. “Just incredible.”
He continues to massage my ass as he leans away, reaching into his
bedside drawer, and I have a feeling I already know what he's grabbing.
There's a hushed click as he flips open the lid to the lube. I try to calm my
racing heart, nervous I'm not going to like it or it's going to hurt.
I jump a little when I feel the blunt tip of his finger against my hole.
“Relax,” he says, rubbing my cheeks but leaving his finger there. I do
my best to listen, sucking in small, steady breaths. “Good girl.”
The two simple words have me melting like a puddle of goo, and I had
no idea I needed to hear them as badly as I do. He takes the chance to slip
the tip of his finger in. It feels…strange, but good.
“You okay?”
I nod.
“Words, Emilia,” he reminds me.
“Y-Yes. I'm okay. I want…more.”
He obliges, pushing the digit in farther, working it in and out over and
over again. The small bite of pain goes away, and before I know it, my hips
are moving on their own, seeking more of his touch.
He wraps his arm around my middle, pulling me up to my knees. I cry
out when the angle changes, sending him deeper. I need him deeper.
I need… “More.”
He chuckles darkly, then pulls away completely. I'm about to protest,
but then I feel more lube drip onto me followed by the obvious intrusion of
not one but two fingers pressing against my hole.
“Relax for me, sweetheart. I got you.”
And I do.
Slowly, he works two fingers inside, mimicking the same thing he did
before, and it's not long before I'm pushing back, seeking his thrusts.
“Jesus, you're killing me,” he mutters. “So damn beautiful.”
I'm killing him?! He's killing me! Having him in my ass…it's so good.
Almost too good. The noises leaving my mouth…they're scandalous. I
should be mortified at the way I'm arching back into him, begging him for
more.
Because I need more. I need something.
I reach a hand between my legs, and just as my fingertips graze my clit,
he's there, grabbing my hand and trapping it behind my back so I can't
touch myself.
“Smith!”
“Not yet.” Another dark laugh fades into a groan. “Fuck. Your ass is
going to look so pretty taking my cock.”
I groan. “Y-Yes. Please.”
“Soon. Not today. I need time to stretch you more, and right now, I
don't have that patience.” He withdraws his fingers, and I cry out at the
loss. “Don't move.”
I don't dare.
I hear him back inside the bedside table, then the telltale sounds of a
condom being ripped open and rolled on.
“I need to be in you,” he mutters, and that's all the warning I get before
he's thrusting into me hard.
“Oh fuck!” I scream out, my pussy clenching around him, pulling him in
deep and begging for more.
He gives it to me. He gives it all to me. His hips slam into me so hard I
know at this time tomorrow, I'm still going to be able to feel him, and I
can't wait for it.
“Mine,” he grunts, pounding into me. “Your pussy is mine.”
Yours. Yours. Yours.
“And one day, this ass will be mine too.”
He slides his fingers back into my ass, and the sensation of being filled
in both holes is almost too much. I feel stuffed and used, but in the best kind
of way. There's sweat dripping down my neck, and my breaths are so sharp
my chest is literally aching. My arms hurt from being pinned back, and I
just feel so…done.
“Fuck, you take me so good, Emilia. So damn good.”
“Please, Owen. Please,” I beg, but I don't know what I'm begging for.
More? For him to stop? For a release?
Being him, he knows exactly what I need. He lets go of my wrist, and I
sigh at the relief.
“Touch yourself.”
I heed his instruction, slipping my hand between my legs, drawing one,
two, three short circles on my clit before I cease to exist on this planet.
Everything goes blissfully quiet as my orgasm races through me. I feel it
everywhere, my pussy, my ass, the pulse of my clit against my fingers.
It's pure ecstasy.
“Fuck. Shit. Fuck,” Smith mutters, feeling it rack my body as I tighten
around him.
He pulls out of me, ripping off the condom, and gives himself a few
strokes until he's spilling his orgasm across my back.
Marking me.
Claiming me.
His. His. His.
I collapse into the bed, every single inch of my body numb. Smith falls
into a heap beside me, trying to catch his breath. I have no idea how long
we lie there, how long there's no other sound in the apartment except our
heavy breaths.
Eventually, Smith pulls himself off the bed and pads into the bathroom.
I hear him move around, washing his hands, then gurgling mouthwash. He
returns quickly with a wet washcloth, gently wipes away the leftover lube
on my ass, and proceeds to clean away the mess he made on my back.
He tosses the cloth back into the bathroom, then scoops me into his
arms and wraps us both back under the blanket. He hauls me against his
chest, hugging me close, and I snuggle into him. We stay like that for what
feels like hours, the threat of sleep always looming just out of reach.
The sun clears the horizon, and the noises of the city begin. Only then
do we make an effort to join the rest of the waking world.
Smith peers down at me, and I look up at him.
He grins. “Good morning.”
I chuckle. “Good morning. Breakfast?”
He nods. “Let's order in.”
It's a good thing he doesn't have practice today, because we spend the
rest of the morning just like that.
Tori wasn't too happy when I called and told her I'd be working from
home, but I didn't care. There was no way I would have been able to face
her after last night and this morning. All she would have to do is raise one
of those perfectly plucked eyebrows of hers, and I'd cave.
Of course, as soon as I got off the phone with her, Blake texted me
wondering where the hell I was.
I hated lying to him, but I know I'd have hated having to face him even
more.
We finally make our way from the bed to the couch at about two PM.
We turn a movie on, but it's long forgotten when Smith makes me sit on the
coffee table and finger myself to completion while he watches, refusing to
touch me no matter how much I beg. After I come, he fucks me again.
We sit out on his patio at around four, and he lays me out on the
lounger, then buries his face between my legs. He doesn't make love to me
until I come twice.
“Are you hungry?” Smith asks at around seven, his fingers kneading my
feet.
My stomach growls in response, and I realize then we haven't eaten
since breakfast.
“Starving apparently,” I say. “Should we order in again?”
“I was thinking of making some pasta. I have some chicken and veggies
in the fridge. We can make something with that.”
My brows lift. “You know how to like cook cook? Not just breakfast
foods?”
He glares. “Well, breakfast is my specialty, but I'm an almost fortyyear-old bachelor, Emilia. I can't live off takeout forever. Of course I can
cook. Can you?”
I lift my shoulder. “Some things. Not many, and not very well, to be
honest.”
He shoves my feet off his lap, then rises from the couch, holding his
hand out for me. “Come on, then. Today we're going to learn.”
I tip my head at him. “Can I use this in the profile?”
It's the first time either of us has mentioned work since our discussion
this morning. It feels wrong to ask but also too good a piece of information
to pass up.
He nods, and I slide my hand into his, letting him pull me to the kitchen.
He sets me on the counter next to him, talking me through how he preps
and cuts the chicken. He throws a few different herbs and spices into the
pan with plenty of olive oil, then gets started on making the sauce.
Watching him move through the kitchen in nothing but a pair of black
sweats…it's hypnotizing. He throws together a completely home-cooked
meal while carrying on a conversation with me and does it effortlessly all
while looking like a GQ model.
It's ridiculous and unfair.
But damn am I thankful for the show.
When dinner is ready, Smith pulls me onto his lap and proceeds to feed
me my entire meal. It feels so…intimate. I've never had someone take care
of me the way he does, never had someone pay so much attention to me.
It's almost unnerving but also incredibly hot.
“I can't,” I tell him as he tries to get me to eat another bite. “I'm
stuffed.”
He lifts a brow. “Not yet, but you can be.”
I gape at him, a choked laugh sputtering out of me. “Owen Smith…
that's naughty!”
He pins me with a stare. “Oh, that's what's naughty? Not you sucking
cum off my cock while I fingered your ass not even two hours ago?”
I blush at his words.
“Don't get shy on me now,” he says, pinching my sides playfully. “I
have plans for you later.”
I've never been so sexually satisfied yet still so hungry for more in my
life. Any time I think there's no way I could possibly orgasm again, Smith
proves me wrong.
“How is your refractory period even this good?”
He narrows his eyes at my obvious reference to his age. “Making up for
lost time.”
“Making up for…” I roll my eyes. “Please. Like you've lost any time.
You're a damn NHL star—you can get laid whenever.”
A dark look crosses his face, and he grabs my chin, pulling my face to
his.
“First, don't roll your eyes at me. Second”—his grip tightens, not
enough to hurt but just enough to be a warning—“I'm making up for lost
time.”
I…I don't understand what he's saying. Smith is attractive, always
making lists of hockey's hottest eligible bachelors. He has women throwing
themselves at him all the time. Hell, it happened in the coffee shop just
before Christmas, so I don't understand what lost time he's—
I gasp.
“You…haven't been with anyone since me?”
He shakes his head, releasing my face, his hand falling back to my hip.
“No.”
“That's…over two years.”
“Trust me, I'm aware.”
“But why?” I blurt out. “Why wait that long? That's…”
He lifts his shoulders. “Nothing ever felt right. What about…you?” He
swallows, almost like he hates asking the question. “I'm not going to be
upset if you have. I—”
“No,” I cut him off.
His eyes spark. “No?”
I shake my head. “No. I tried. I went on a lot of dates.” His grip on my
hip tightens at that, but I keep going. “There was nothing though. Nothing
felt as good as…”
You.
I leave it unsaid, but I know he's aware of what I mean.
This. Us.
He blows out a relieved breath. “I understand.”
The reality of that settles over us, because we both know no matter how
good it feels, it can't last, not while we're in the positions we're in.
“I…I should go,” I say, trying to push from his lap.
He doesn't let me move.
“Smith…”
“Do you want to go?”
I sigh, dropping my forehead to his. “I should. We both know that.”
“There are a lot of things we apparently should do, Emilia, but it doesn't
mean we have to do them.” He squeezes my hip. “Just fun, remember?”
“Just fun.”
“Good. So, let me ask again, do you want to go?”
“No.”
“Then stay.”
And I do.

SMITH
She stayed.
I'm supposed to be thinking about hockey. The puck, the net, where I
need to be on the ice to cover my man—that is all I should be thinking
about, especially with a game this evening, but I can't get the image of
Emilia on her knees in the shower this morning out of my head because she
stayed.
She's been over at my house every night this week and has stayed over
all but one of them, including this morning when I woke up with my cock
against her ass and her pressing back, seeking my touch.
I obliged, of course, and then we took a shower, where she sucked me
off and made me late for the morning skate.
We've kept to our agreement of living inside a bubble. When we're at
my apartment, we're just us. She's not the girl waiting for the promotion,
and I'm not the guy who plays hockey for her uncle. We're just Emilia and
Owen and we're just having fun; that's it. It's uncomplicated and easy, and
for the first time in a long time, I'm feeling good.
“You're chipper.” Miller flops down onto the bench beside me. “Get
your dick wet?”
“Miller!” Lowell chides as he walks by, shaking his head at the kid for
his crudeness.
“Pretty sure I heard him whistling when he walked in this morning,”
Rhodes comments, dropping down across from us.
I glare at him. “I was not.” I turn to Miller. “And I'm not chipper.”
“Well, you're not my kind of chipper,” he says, “but you're chipper by
your standards.”
“I am not.”
His face scrunches up. “Not right now you're definitely not with all of
your arguing and glowering.” He shakes his head. “I take it back. You're
clearly not getting laid, but you should. You need it.”
“You offering?” I tease.
“Like you could handle me,” he mutters before storming off, and I feel
good knowing I somehow managed to annoy the most obnoxious guy on
the team. I'm glad that maybe—just maybe—I've thrown him off.
“He's right, you know,” our goalie says, fidgeting with his equipment.
“You're different lately.”
I don't spend a lot of time with Greer outside the rink. A few shindigs
here and there, but I wouldn't say we're close by any stretch of the
imagination. I highly doubt he's a good judge of how much I have or
haven't changed.
“How would you know?”
He shrugs. “I'm observant.”
That's one word for what he is. “Uh-huh.”
He peeks up at me, then back at his pads. “It started around whenever
that ginger in media began coming around more often. Whatever”—another
glance, this one a lot more suggestive than the other—“thing it is you're
working on with her, it's definitely changed something in you.”
I barely fight the urge to roll my eyes. “Right. And this change would
be…”
“He was right,” Rhodes speaks up, pointing toward the door Miller
disappeared through. “You're chipper.”
I grit my teeth together. “I'm really not.”
Rhodes tips his head to the side, watching me. “Hmm.”
“What?”
“Nothing.”
“That didn't sound like nothing.”
“Well, it was.” He shrugs. “I'm hitting the ice.”
I glare after him.
“Smith!”
I snap my head up to find Coach Martin standing in the doorway, hands
on his hips, a serious look on his face.
Oh fuck. He knows.
I'm dead. Or worse, off the team. They're benching me for breaking the
rules.
“Uh, what's up, Coach?” I try for nonchalant and hope to fuck I don't
sound like I'm about to have a very real panic attack.
“I think you know what's up—you're avoiding me, and I know why.”
My heart pounds so hard in my chest that there's no way Coach Martin
doesn't hear it. The very real fear of having a heart attack—which would
just do wonders for my old man status—hits me.
“Board drills!” He laughs. “I know they're your favorite.” He claps his
hands together. “Come on. Chop, chop. Meet me on the ice in five.”
He walks away, and I sink back into my cubby, blowing out a relieved
breath.
He doesn't know. Thank fuck he doesn't know.
Greer laughs. I almost forgot he was there.
He shakes his head.
“What?” I bark out, annoyed with him.
“Nothing. Just…a theory.”
“A theory?”
“Yeah,” he says, rising to his skates. “About you and that hot little
redhead.”
I push off the bench, and yeah, Greer is a big dude, but I'm bigger. I
tower over him, looking down my nose at him and that stupid fucking smirk
on his face.
“What about her?” Even I hear the jealousy in those three words.
I don't like him noticing her. I don't like him talking about her. I don't
even like him being in the same room as her.
My reaction makes him laugh harder, and my brows slam together even
tighter.
“It's just interesting that your mood changed when you started working
with her…almost as if she has something to do with it.”
He lifts a brow, waiting for me to tell him he's wrong.
I don't.
“Hmm. Interesting.” He steps away and around me, checking his
shoulder against mine. When he's at the door, he pauses and looks back.
“You know, Miller was wrong. You don't need to get laid—you already
are.” He walks away, leaving me standing there fuming.
I want to run after him and deny everything, tell him he's wrong and
there's nothing going on between Emilia and me.
But it'd be a fucking lie and we both know it.
“Please tell me he's joking.” I whirl around to see Lowell standing at
the door. He's resting on his stick, his watchful gaze burning into me. “Are
you screwing around with Emilia?”
“It's not what Greer thinks.” The lie tumbles out easily, and I pray
Lowell believes it.
“Are you sure about that? Because you look pretty damn guilty to me
right now.” He shakes his head. “You know what? I don't care whether it's
true or not. I don't want to hear about it. Just whatever it is…fix it.”
He stalks away, still shaking his head at me.
He's right. What Emilia and I are doing…it's a stupid game, a
dangerous one. I know better than to play it.
I'm not on any leader boards for penalty minutes, but I always did have
a knack for finding myself in the sin bin, and if this all blows up in our
faces, that's exactly where I'm headed.
I just hope it's worth it.
I've done a lot of hard things in my lifetime, battled at the boards for long
torturous hours, played games where I walked out with broken bones, and
have just generally put myself through hell, all in the name of a sport.
But this? It has to be one of the most difficult things I've done.
“This is pure torture,” Greer says from beside me, and for once, I agree
with the guy. “I fucking hate kids. Can't stand the little crotch goblins.”
Well, that part I don't agree with. I don't have any feelings toward
children one way or the other. They're cute sometimes, but other times,
they're annoying little shits. As far as having any, I think I could take it or
leave it.
But having to attend a baby shower where there are women oohing and
aahing over all things baby—it's kind of a bit much.
For the most part, Hollis and Lowell have kept this whole thing lowkey, but there is still a horde of women who won't stop squealing over all
the tiny wittle baby cwothes. It's grating on my last damn nerve.
“Is it too soon to leave?” he says.
“Unfortunately. I need a drink,” I mutter, heading for the little bar they
graciously provided for us folk who can drink. I pour myself a glass of
whiskey, then turn to find Lowell and Miller standing near the doorway to
the room. Lowell looks like he's about two seconds away from driving his
fist into Miller's face. Whatever Miller did or said, I'm sure it would be
deserved.
“Go. Away,” Lowell says to the kid as I approach.
“Roger that.”
Miller takes off faster than he's ever moved before.
I follow Lowell's gaze to Hollis, who is surrounded by Ryan, Emilia,
and Harper, and several other players' wives. He looks like he's about to
stalk across the room, throw his pregnant woman over his shoulder, and
carry her away from all the prying eyes.
I get it. I've been wanting to do the same with Emilia since we got here.
Even though she woke up in my bed this morning, we arrived separately
so we wouldn't draw any suspicion. We've also spent the afternoon
ignoring one another, which has been harder than I thought it would be. A
few times I almost reached out and brushed some hair off her shoulder, but
then I realized at the last moment that I couldn't do that, especially not with
all the watchful eyes around.
Pretending at the rink is one thing because we're at work, but here?
Surrounded by our friends who are so open with one another? It's hard to
remember she's not mine and, no matter how badly I want her there, she
doesn't belong at my side.
“Those are some rather territorial vibes you're giving off about
somebody you're not even dating,” I say, taking Miller's place. “Because
you're allegedly still not dating, right?”
He ignores me, and I laugh.
“Come on, man. You can't really tell me you're not dating—not when
you're looking at her like that.”
He's staring out at Hollis like she's an angel walking the earth. It's
funny to see how much he's changed over the last five months since finding
out about the baby, from anti-commitment and never letting anyone come
over to his place to looking awfully cozy with the woman carrying his child
and hosting a damn baby shower at his house.
He glares over at me. “I don't know what you're talking about. There's
nothing going on.”
“Uh-huh. Sure. Right. Nothing at all.”
“What's going on with you and Emilia? Is that nothing too?” he shoots
right back at me.
I snap my mouth closed, feeling a lot less like teasing him.
“That's what I thought,” he mutters.
“Nothing is going on with me and…” I hesitate, afraid to say her name,
because if I do, I know it's going to come out sounding entirely too sweet.
Lowell's not stupid. He'll pick up on it. “Her,” I finish.
He scoffs. “You can't even say her name.”
“I can too.”
“Prove it.”
I tip my chin up. “No. I don't need to prove shit to you.”
“Weird. I don't need to prove shit to you either.”
He shoves past me, disappearing into the kitchen.
I want to be annoyed with him, but I guess fair is fair. I'm not exactly
being forthcoming about what's going on with Emilia, so I can't expect him
to open up to me with what's happening with him and Hollis.
I can say though that he's holding back for no reason at all. It's clear
he's falling for her and she's falling for him, and not just because she's
having his child. There's a love there that's lurking deeper beneath the
surface. I saw it at Harper and Collin's wedding last summer when they
met.
I wish he would realize what's right in front of him and take advantage
of it, embrace it. I sure as hell wish I could.
Emilia throws her head back, laughing at something Miller says. The
sunlight pouring into the room catches her red hair just right, almost making
it look gold. The strands are swept up in her usual bun and my fingers itch
to pull it down and wrap it around my fist. She's gorgeous, and I wish so
fucking badly I could march across this room and kiss her.
Claim her.
Let everyone know she's mine.
I take a step and—
“Heya, kid,” our head coach, Heller, says, stopping me in my tracks.
I relax, lifting my chin at the older man. “Coach.”
He's on the smaller side, but it doesn't mean shit. Back in his days of
playing in the NHL, he was known for being an enforcer, tough as nails and
ready to throw down with the best of them. Sometimes I think his smaller
stature came in handy during the fights. He was little enough to move
quickly and be able to duck, but also sturdy enough to keep his skates
upright.
“Sometimes I miss this part of it,” he says, looking out at the group
gathered. “Being part of a team, you know? These found families. It's tough
when it's all gone.”
Family.
That is what we have here. Even though Greer pisses me off and
Miller's obnoxious on a good day, we're still a family, and we have each
other's back. We're there for each other through all the trials and
tribulations.
Once my contract expires, does this expire too? I hate the idea of losing
this as much as I hate the idea of losing.
Coach clears his throat. “Ah, ignore the ramblings of an old man. I'm
taking off, getting out of your hair because I know it's no fun with Coach
hanging around.” He tips his head toward the rest of the crowd. “Keep an
eye on these kids, will ya?”
“Shouldn't you be telling your captain that?”
“Would, but I can't seem to find him or his gal.” He does his best to
fight a knowing grin. Lowell might think he's fooling everyone saying he
doesn't have feelings for Hollis, but if even Coach is picking up on it, it's a
losing battle. “Figured I'd task that job to you with you being the oldest.
Besides, you're a lot less trouble than any of these young people. You're the
one I never have to worry about.”
Bile works its way up the back of my throat and I swallow it down,
trying not to vomit all over Coach's nice dress shirt. If he only knew…
“I'll keep an eye on them,” I say quietly.
He claps me on the shoulder. “Knew I could count on you. Tell Lowell
and Hollis thank you for the invite.”
“Will do.”
He gives me another smile before disappearing through the house.
I watch as he goes, trying to swallow back the guilt that's eating at me.
Coach has done so much for me, and how am I repaying him? By lying to
him? Breaking rules put in place for a good reason? I should be ashamed of
myself.
But I'm not.
I'm not, because Emilia? She feels right.
“Hey.” That combination of lavender and vanilla I can't seem to get
enough of hits me. “Everything okay?”
Her eyes flick to where Coach Heller is going, and I know what she's
really asking: Does he know?
With a quick glance around the room to make sure nobody is watching
—and no one is—I grab Emilia's hand and haul her down the hallway into
an empty bathroom. She lets out a little squeak as I pull her in and press her
against the door, framing her body with my own, a knee pressed between
her legs.
“Owen, I—”
I don't let her finish that sentence. Instead, I cover her mouth with my
own, kissing away every last worry she could possibly be having right now.
I shouldn't be doing this. Not here, not now.
But I can't help it. I have to touch her. It's torture sitting on the other
side of the room watching her laugh and smile with everyone else.
I want her laughs. I want her smiles.
I want her.
Need her.
Crave her.
I should be concerned that I'm losing control and doing this here, but I
don't care, not when I have her under me. I don't stop kissing her, not even
when she's mewling against me and rubbing her pussy along my thigh.
I'd bet at least a year's salary if I were to step away from her right now,
there'd be a dark spot on my jeans from her soaking-wet cunt. I slide my
hand up her thigh, pushing the dress she's wearing up around her waist, and
run a single knuckle over her.
I wrench my mouth from hers, kissing my way down her chin, over her
neck, then back to her lips again, all while running my finger over her
pussy.
“Fuck, Emilia,” I mutter. “You're so damn wet for me.”
I shove her panties to the side and, without warning, slide two fingers
inside of her.
“Oh god,” she moans, and it's loud, so loud I clamp my hand against her
mouth.
She stares up at me with wide, lustful eyes, then bears down on my
fingers, and I curse myself for what I started as she begins to fuck herself
on my hand.
She doesn't take her eyes off me, riding me, moaning again as I hook
them inside of her, hitting that spot I know she loves. She picks up her pace,
riding me harder and faster, and I wish it were my cock buried in her
instead of my fingers.
“You're so beautiful, Emilia,” I tell her, my eyes on hers. “So gorgeous.
You're doing such a good job fucking my fingers, you know that?”
She nods.
“Fuck, you need to see this. You need to see how good you look.”
Another nod.
I spin us until we're facing the mirror, and I hold her in front of me,
letting her see what I'm seeing.
“Hold your dress up,” I murmur in her ear. “Look.”
She listens, lifting her dress until it's around her waist, her eyes
dropping to where she rides my hand. Her bottom lip is trapped between her
teeth, sweat beading at her temples, her hair a wild mess.
She's stunning, and she's getting close. I can feel it in the way she's
squeezing me, desperate for release.
“Can you take more, sweetheart?”
She doesn't speak; she can't. She simply nods, and I slide a third finger
into her pussy. She squeezes around me, a low, soft moan escaping her.
When she tries to close her eyes and drop her head, I don't let her. I wrap
my hand around her throat with my free hand, lifting her head back up until
she's looking in the mirror.
“Watch the way you fuck yourself, Emilia. Look how beautiful you
are.”
Her eyes are on her pussy, and when I press my thumb to her clit, she's
shaking in my arms, falling apart on my fingers. I pull her lips to mine,
swallowing her moans with my kiss again, hoping nobody can hear us.
She rides me through her orgasm, slowing and steadying her
movements until the final shocks are gone. I slowly slide my fingers from
her pussy, and she whimpers as I lazily pet her, allowing her a moment to
catch her breath.
“I wish I could taste you right now,” I say in her ear. “When we get
home, I'm going to bury my face between your thighs and lick your pussy
until it's squeezing my tongue.”
She shivers at the idea, looking every bit like she's ready to go again.
I'm about to say fuck it and drop to my knees when the door handle rattles.
Emilia lets out a loud squeak, turning into my arms.
“Oh! Shit! Sorry!” Rhodes calls from the other side of the door. “Didn't
realize anyone was in here. My bad.”
“It's cool, man,” I call out.
“Oh…Smith? Thought that high-pitched scream was a chick for a
moment.”
“Fuck off.”
Rhodes laughs. “Have you seen Emilia? I think Ryan was looking for
her.”
Emilia's eyes widen, and with her hair all over the place, she looks wild.
“No,” I lie, motioning for her to fix it. “Last I saw her she was taking a
phone call outside.”
“Huh. Okay, I'll tell Ryan. You, uh, going to be much longer? I really
have to take a leak.”
“Can you not keep talking to me when I have my dick in my hand?”
“Like I haven't seen it before,” Rhodes mutters. “I'll just use the other
bathroom.”
He retreats, and I wait several moments before turning to Emilia, who is
still trying to tame her mane.
“That was entirely too close,” she whispers, shoving stray hairs into
place.
“I didn't hear you complaining.”
Her cheeks pinken at my words. She turns, facing me. “Well, no, of
course not—but that's beside the point. We have bigger fish to fry.”
“Yeah, like the fact that Rhodes now thinks I scream like a girl.”
She narrows her eyes. “What's wrong with a girl scream?”
“My scream is very, very deep, thank you very much.”
She rolls her lips together, patting my chest. “I'm sure it is. We should
head back before someone realizes I'm not in fact outside on the phone.”
She gives me a look for that lie.
“What was I supposed to do? Tell him you're in here about to get your
pussy eaten?”
She makes a noise that's halfway between a groan and a moan. “Smith!”
I grin. “Look, I'll go out first, then you wait a few minutes and follow.
Sound good?”
She nods, shoving me toward the door.
I grab the handle, but before I open the door, I look back at her. “Oh,
and, Emilia?”
“Hmm?”
“I intend to make good on that promise.”
Her face flames red as I close the door, and I swear I hear her mutter,
“What the hell have I gotten myself into?”
I've been asking myself the same thing.

EMILIA & SMITH
Smith: Please tell me your night was better than mine.
Emilia: I'm sorry about the loss. That one was brutal.
Smith: Getting shut out is never good, but when it's a team
that's 30th in the league? Hurts.
Emilia: If it makes you feel any better, I've been at the office
since eight AM.
Smith: Are you still there?
Emilia: Yes.
Smith: What the hell for?
Emilia: Tori. She needs me to write up a proposal for a
campaign with a local charity, and she needs it by tomorrow.
She sprung it on me right before puck drop, so I had to juggle
the game and now this.
Smith: Screw that. Leave.
Emilia: I will soon. I just have a few more things to put
together and then I'm good.
Smith: Emilia…
Emilia: That's my name. Don't wear it out.
Emilia: Unless it's in bed. *wink*
Smith: I'm being serious.
Emilia: So am I. *double wink*
Smith: Wouldn't that just be a blink?
Emilia: No! I winked twice!
Smith: You really should go home. Finish it in the morning.
Emilia: I already have stuff to do tomorrow morning.
Smith: I'm sorry. I wish I was there to help.
Emilia: I don't. Your version of “helping” is to get me naked.
Emilia: Actually, I lied. I do wish you were here.
Smith: That's what I thought.
Smith: At least text me when you get home.
Emilia: You're kind of bossy, you know.
Smith: You like it.
Emilia: I do. Possibly a bit too much.
Smith: No such thing as too much.
Smith: Now, go work. Get your shit done and get home.
Within the next hour, please.
Emilia: Yes, sir.
Smith: You're playing with fire, Emilia.
Emilia: What are you going to do? Glare menacingly at your
flip phone?
Smith: Flip phone??
Smith: I'm not that old!
Emilia: Whatever you say, gramps.
Smith: I swear, I'm spanking your ass when I get back.
Emilia: Promises, promises.
Emilia: *kissy-face emoji*
Emilia: Don't hate me, but when you get home, we need more
content.
Smith: MORE?
Smith: How many damn videos do we need for this thing?
Emilia: A lot.
Emilia: We post daily, and not everything is for the player
profile. Some of it is just for the team.
Smith: No.
Emilia: Please??
Smith: Fine.
Smith: But for a price.
Emilia: *sigh*
Emilia: You want to see my boobs, don't you?
Smith: Yes.
Emilia: Fine.
Emilia: You're such a guy, you know that?
Smith: Yep. Well aware.
Smith: What are the videos about?
Emilia: It's a Q&A series. We have fans submit questions,
then we filter through them. It will only be about ten.
Emilia: For the profile, I mean.
Emilia: It'll be at least five videos for the team.
Smith: FIVE?!?
Emilia:
Smith: I want more than boobs.
Emilia: Fine. I'll send both tits, then.
Smith: You were only going to send one???
Smith: That's just mean.
Smith: Tease.
Emilia: Damn right I am!
Emilia: What am I getting out of sending you a tit pic?
Smith: THE VIDEOS!
Emilia: Those are for the team, not me.
Smith: You make a valid point, but I really feel like that's
cheating.
Emilia: Oh, it definitely is.
Emilia: But you're going to let me cheat anyway.
Smith: I am?
Emilia: Yes. Because I'm cute.
Smith: Hmm.
Smith: Fair.
Smith: You're kind of sassy today, you know that?
Emilia: I know.
Smith: Well, as long as you're aware.
Emilia: On a scale of 1-10, how good of a dancer are you?
Smith: 0
Emilia: That's not a valid answer.
Smith: -1
Emilia: Smith…
Smith: I am not dancing.
Smith: Never.
Smith: Ever.
Smith: Keep fucking dreaming.
Emilia: Not even for the team?
Smith: Not a chance.
Emilia: BOO!
Smith: Boo me all you want. It's not happening.
Emilia: It will make really good content though…
Smith: I don't care. Dancing is where I draw the line.
Emilia: Lowell's dancing.
Smith: What dirt do you have on him?
Emilia: Enough.
Smith: I'm curious but I know you well enough to know that if I
want details, I'll have to make an exchange and I'm still not
dancing.
Emilia: Ugh. Fine.
Emilia: *crosses off next ten ideas*
Smith: I'm sure you'll come up with something else.
Emilia: And here I was, ready to offer up blow jobs in
exchange for content.
Smith: …
Smith: What kind of dancing?
Smith: Be honest…
Smith: Does it make me an old man if I order oatmeal for
breakfast?
Emilia: Yes.
Smith: You're supposed to say no.
Emilia: Well, I don't want to lie to you so…
Emilia: Yes.
Emilia: It's a total old person food.
Smith: Watch your tone, little girl.
Emilia: It's text. You can't hear my tone.
Smith: Trust me, I can.
Emilia: Can you hear this?
Smith: You just rolled your eyes, didn't you?
Emilia: Possibly. *grins*
Smith: I thought you youngins were supposed to show your
elders respect.
Emilia: I don't think you “respected” me very much the last
time I saw you.
Smith: I did and that's exactly why I did what I did.
Emilia: Okay. That's fair.
Emilia: Why are you worried about being “old” for ordering
oatmeal?
Emilia: Wait. Let me guess. Miller?
Smith: No. That shithead Greer.
Emilia: You don't like your goalie?
Smith: Of course I like my goalie. But only on the ice.
Smith: He's a cocky little prick.
Emilia: But also totally saving your asses this year.
Smith: Whose side are you on here?
Emilia: Yours. Totally yours.
Emilia: But…am I lying?
Smith: No.
Emilia: That totally killed you to say, didn't it?
Smith: Yes.
Emilia: You'll be fine.
Emilia: I'll make sure I kiss you back to life when you get
home tomorrow.
Smith: Start with my dick, please.
Emilia: We'll see.
Emilia: *whispers* That's a lie. I totally will.

EMILIA
“You're telling me you've lived here nearly three years and you have never
been here before?”
“Nope. Not once.”
He presses his hand to his chest. “That is a travesty.”
“Does it count that I've at least had the donuts before? Sometimes
there's a box floating around the break room.”
“It makes it better, but trust me, they're even better fresh.” He pats his
flat stomach. “My mouth is watering just thinking about them.”
“Calm down. I'm sure there's not that big of a difference.”
He pins me with a stare that tells me I'm wrong.
It's a random Wednesday in February, so I'm really not expecting the
line standing before me. It's at least six customers deep when we step up to
the back.
“Is it always like this?”
Smith nods. “Pretty much.”
“Wow. I didn't realize it was this popular.”
“Even when you want to, Scout's hard to resist.”
“Scout?”
He points to the woman behind the register of the adorable baby-blue
food truck. “That's Scout. She's the owner, baker, and best donut maker.”
He grins at his rhyme. “But seriously, she's great.”
“You're on a first-name basis with her?”
He shrugs. “I eat a lot of donuts.”
Scout notices Smith pointing her way and waves. Just about everyone in
line ahead of us turns to see who she's waving at, and many of them begin
talking behind their hands when they realize it's a Comets player. Smith
pulls his hat down low, but it's pointless. Everyone already knows it's him.
I take note of the fact that so many people here know who he is and put
a little extra space between us just in case. If Smith notices, he doesn't say
anything.
One by one, people in line start coming up to Smith and asking for an
autograph. He's more than happy to do it, and I really appreciate that about
him. By the time we make it to the front to order, Scout's giving Smith a
sheepish grin.
“Sorry. Didn't mean to draw attention.”
Smith shrugs. “They would have noticed me eventually. Always
happens.”
“It really does. You hockey players are good for business.” She turns to
me, beaming. “Hi. I don't think we've met before. I'm Scout.”
“Emilia. Your donuts are delicious, but I've unfortunately never had the
chance to make it here before.”
“Well, welcome to Scout's Sweets.” She waves her hand around. “It's
not much, but it's mine.”
“Not much? This place is so cute! I love the little sandbox and the
mobile library.”
Her eyes light up. “I'm a huge book lover.”
“Boys in books are just better,” I say.
“Yes! That's exactly what I always say!”
“I take great offense to that,” Smith interjects.
Scout and I both roll our eyes at him because he just doesn't get it.
“Anyway,” Scout says, “what can I get for you today?” She points to
Smith. “I'm assuming your usual Granny Apple donuts and coffee?”
I try not to laugh at the irony of his donut order.
“Please, and then whatever Emilia here wants,” he tells her, pulling his
wallet from his back pocket.
I tap my fingers against my chin, perusing the menu. “I've had your
glazed donuts several times before, but I'm feeling a bit adventurous today.
Any suggestions?”
“Do you prefer chocolate or vanilla?”
“Chocolate. Always.”
“While I love all the donuts I make, I have a soft spot for my Pretty
Please donut. It's a chocolate base with cherry frosting.”
“Perfect. I'll take two of those and an iced coffee with—”
“Cream and three sugars,” Smith finishes for me, handing his card over
to Scout.
Her eyes bounce between the two of us, and I'm not loving how
perceptive they are, or the knowing grin she gives us as she charges the
card.
“Go have a seat,” she tells us. “I'll bring your order out for you.”
Smith's hand goes to my lower back, and I wonder if he even notices—I
sure do—as he steers us toward one of the few unoccupied picnic tables
toward the back of the lot.
I try not to laugh at how ridiculous Smith looks sliding into it. He's so
big he makes it look like he's sitting on kids' furniture instead of at a
regular-sized table.
“Don't laugh at me just because I ate my vegetables and you didn't. Not
my fault you stopped growing.”
“Hey, I'll have you know I am above average height for women, thank
you very much. I ate my vegetables too. You're just freakishly gigantic.”
“In many areas.”
“Smith!” I admonish, looking around to make sure nobody heard him,
but it's pointless. We're practically all alone back here. I have a feeling he
chose this spot for that exact reason. “This is supposed to be a work
breakfast, you know.”
“Does the working start now, or did it start earlier when I was eating
your—”
I slap my hand over his mouth.
“Not another word,” I say, sharpening my gaze.
I don't have to see his mouth to know he's grinning at me. I can see it in
his eyes.
I peel my hand away just as Scout makes her way over to us, two
coffees and a box of donuts in her hand.
“Here you go,” she says, setting our order down on the table. She turns
to Smith and holds what looks like a piece of construction paper out to him.
“And this is for you from Macie.”
A small smile plays on Smith's lips as he takes the paper. “Thanks.”
“Don't thank her yet. Just wait until you see the picture she drew of
you.” Scout laughs. “Enjoy the donuts.” She practically skips back to the
food truck, and I nod toward the paper.
“What's that she gave you?”
Smith grins, looking down at what appears to be a homemade card.
“Last year, Scout's eight-year-old niece, Macie, needed a sponsor for her
soccer team so they could afford to get their uniforms made, so I covered it
for them. This season, I just outright sponsored the whole year.” He shrugs.
“It was no big deal.”
He says it so casually, like to him it really wasn't a big deal, and I'm
sure that is the case. But for the little girl and her soccer team, I know it
meant the world having a famous athlete cover things for them so they
don't have to worry about expenses and can just play.
“Anyway, since then, she's been dropping thank-you cards with Scout
every few weeks, so I began sending her notes back and drawing pictures in
them. It's silly stuff mostly, her as a superhero, that kind of thing. At first, it
was fun, then she started taking some…creative liberties.” He frowns. “Like
at Christmas. That one was sweet…until you opened it.”
“What'd it say?”
“It wasn't so much what it said but how she drew me. There were lines
all over my face, and when I asked what they were, she looked me straight
in the eyes and said wrinkles.”
I laugh, not just at the card and what the bold little girl wrote, but also at
the way Smith's brows slam together. I'm almost certain the wrinkles
forming from his scowling are exactly what she drew.
“Let's hope this one is better,” he mumbles, flipping open the bright
orange paper. He gasps. “That little shit!”
“What is it?” I strain my neck, trying to see what's on the card.
“Scout!” he yells, and she pops her head up. He waves the card. “Tell
that little turd niece of yours that payback is a bitch!”
Scout just laughs, shaking her head.
“What is it?” I ask again, and Smith shoves the card at me, glaring at it
like it's offensive.
He's right. The front is innocent enough. It just says THANK YOU in
sprawling, crooked letters. But when I flip it open, I immediately know
what it is that has him so upset.
Laughter bubbles out of me, which just causes Smith's scowl to deepen
even more.
“It's not funny,” he grumbles.
“Oh, but it is.”
“Is not.” He snatches the card back, tucking it into the inside pocket of
his jacket. “She's eight. She's not supposed to be that mean.” He shakes his
head, and it takes everything I have not to point out the way the sun catches
the gray in his hair that's sticking out of his cap. “A fucking cane. Little shit
drew me with a cane like I'm some old man or something.”
I do a poor job of trying to conceal another laugh, earning me yet
another scowl.
“Come on, it's cute!”
“It's mean. Like I don't already get enough shit from the guys on the
team.”
“Yeah, but they do it because they love you. They don't really care that
you're old.”
“And do you?” he asks. “Care that I'm older than you?”
Our age gap isn't something we've really discussed. We're both aware
there's a ten-year difference between us, but we don't talk about it. Just like
we don't talk about what any of this truly means.
I try not to think about that though.
“No. Not at all. Do you care that I'm younger than you?”
“No. I mean, that first night…” He shakes his head from side to side.
“Yeah, maybe then, but only because I knew I shouldn't have been taking
anyone home, let alone someone ten years younger than me. But…nah. I
haven't really given it much thought since.”
I haven't thought about it much either. I'm sure someone out there
would have an issue with it. But we're both adults, and we're both
thoroughly enjoying whatever this is that we're doing. That should be all
that matters.
“Good. Then it's settled: you don't care that I'm a young spring
chicken, and I don't care that you groan every time you stand.”
He gives me yet another glare as he peels open our box of donuts. He
holds one of mine out to me. “Eat.”
I don't think twice about leaning forward and taking a bite. The warmth
is the first thing I notice, then the delicious cherry frosting mixed with the
chocolate. I can't help the moan that leaves my lips.
Smith doesn't miss it, his eyes darkening for a whole different reason
now.
“See?” he says. “I told you fresh was better.”
“You were right,” I say, taking the donut from his fingers and taking
another bite. The rich flavor explodes over my tongue. “So good.”
“Scout's got talent, that's for sure. But that niece of hers…” He shakes
his head, digging into his own breakfast.
He gets one donut down before someone approaches the table and asks
for an autograph. He grins, agreeing easily, never once making it seem like
they're interrupting his breakfast. I'm so used to being around the game all
the time that I forget the guys on the Comets are idols to some people.
I mean, I'm sure their opinions of them would change if they had to
smell just how quickly those grown men can stink up a locker room and
witness some of the less-than-stellar habits some of them have, but still.
They're famous hockey players, and people all over the world are watching
them.
At one point he even takes the hat off his own head and signs it for a
young kid, then jogs back out to his truck for a new one. I love seeing him
in this environment, interacting outside of the rink when he's not obligated
to do it. He's so patient and kind with every person who approaches,
especially the children, and it's making my heart do funny things to see him
like this.
The more time we spend together, the more I'm really starting to like so
many things about him. He might think all he has going for him is his
hockey skills, but he's so much more than that.
Somehow, I manage to remember to snap a few photos of Smith signing
things for the team's Instagram account, and I also take some pictures on
the fans' phones.
“You're really good at this,” I comment when the crowd at the truck
thins out. “Doing the whole famous hockey player thing. The kids really
look up to you, especially the young ones who play. Have you thought
about doing something with them after you're done in the NHL?”
He tips his head. “Like what?”
I shrug. “I don't know, like coaching or something? I've seen you on the
ice with the guys. Yeah, Lowell might be the captain, but the guys listen to
you just as much as they do him.”
“Only because I'm the oldest.”
I shake my head. “No, that's not the only reason. You just have this…
presence about you. Like you demand attention, but not in a scary way. It's
natural—sort of like the pull my uncle has. I think it could make you a
really good coach.”
“Coaching?” he mutters, pondering it. “I haven't really considered that.”
“Have you given any thought to what you want to do when you're out?”
His lips tug down into a frown, his eyes sliding out to the little lake that
butts up to the parking lot. “I've tried not to think about it too much, you
know? Just trying to live in the moment, enjoy it while it lasts.”
Like a lot of aging athletes, there's been speculation for a few seasons
now about whether or not Smith was going to retire, especially after the
Comets won the Cup. He got the big trophy, so he'd be done for sure then,
right? But no, he stuck around. With his contract expiring at the end of this
year, the talk has really picked up again.
I can understand why he doesn't want to look that far ahead though. I'm
sure it's scary. Hockey is all he's ever known in his adult life. Moving
beyond that is going to be hard.
“Is that…Miller?”
I look to where Smith's staring off across the parking lot and squint,
trying to get a better look at the guy who has a hat pulled down low and a
pair of aviators covering his eyes. If I didn't see him so often, I probably
wouldn't look twice, which is likely why nobody is staring him down like
they did Smith.
“Shit,” Smith mutters. “That is him.”
“Should we try to sneak away?” I ask.
“Nah. Kid is oblivious—probably won't even notice us. Besides, we can
always just say we're working on the player profile if he spots us.”
“We are working on it. That's why we're here and why Tori gave me the
morning away from the office.”
Smith lifts a brow. “Are you going to include the ‘work' we did this
morning in the player profile?”
I try not to blush thinking of how he tugged me into his apartment and
did some very unprofessional things to me before he drove us here to one of
his favorite spots in the city.
“I think I'll leave that out,” I mutter, and he laughs.
Miller, not looking our way at all, struts up to the register, a smile
plastered on his face. Even from here, I can spot Scout's blush, and I can't
say I blame her. Miller's charming and—not that I'd say this out loud to
Smith—hot. It's no wonder Scout is looking at him like she is.
He places his order with a grin, probably being typical Miller and
flirting his ass off with her. Scout turns away for a moment and gets his
order ready. She's grinning at him again as she hands him a box of donuts
and two coffees. I don't miss the way she stares longingly after him as he
makes his way across the parking lot.
He doesn't head for his car, though. He walks right by it and crosses the
street.
At the intersection, a man is sitting there with a sign that reads
ANYTHING HELPS. Miller sits down on the ground next to him, hands him
a coffee, and opens the box of donuts. The man takes one, and Miller takes
another. They sit there talking animatedly for several minutes like they're
old friends swapping stories or something.
Smith and I watch the whole thing, not saying a word.
After Miller gets up, waves goodbye to the man, and leaves, Smith turns
to me and says, “That's who your player profile should have been about.
Not me.”
“The fans voted.”
“Bullshit. Miller was the one who wrote my name in.”
I wince. “Yeah, about that…I kind of know.”
“Wait, you do?”
“Yeah, Miller came to my office one day and confessed everything, said
he felt bad and didn't think you wanted to be part of it because you were
stomping around extra grumpy, and he didn't want it messing with your
game.”
Smith snorts. “Oh, I was pissed all right. Probably more for reasons he
didn't understand.” He waves a hand between us. “But still pissed.”
That same silence that always falls between us at any reminder of how
temporary this is comes again.
It's interrupted when Scout stops at the end of the table.
“I'm heading out for an appointment, and my sister is going to take over
for a few.” She hitches her thumb toward the truck. “Just wanted to make
sure you guys don't need anything else before I go.”
Smith defers to me for the answer.
“Oh, no,” I say, waving my hand. “I think we're good. Excellent
recommendation to get the Pretty Please. That cherry icing was amazing.”
“Thank you. I think it's one of my best ones.” She beams proudly.
“Anyway, I need to run. It was great to meet you, Emilia. I always love it
when the guys start bringing their girlfriends here. It means things are
getting serious.”
“We're not dating,” I say quickly, probably a little too quickly if the
way Smith's head snaps up is any indication. “This is just for work.”
Her mouth opens as she looks back and forth between Smith and me,
and I can feel him staring a hole into the side of my head. I refuse to meet
his stare, knowing full well if I look at him, I'll be giving entirely too much
away.
“Oh. I just thought…” She rolls her lips together, shaking her head.
“Never mind what I thought. My bad.”
“No worries. Speaking of…do you mind if we film a few videos here?
The Comets media department is highlighting Smith, and I'd love to
include one of his favorite spots in some of the posts. We'll tag you in
everything too.”
“Oh, of course!” She claps her hands together, then grins brightly at
Smith. “That's amazing for you!” The smile he gives her back doesn't reach
his eyes, but if Scout notices, she doesn't comment. “Feel free to shoot
wherever. You have my full permission for everything. And if you need
anything—refill, more donuts, whatever—just let Stevie know and she'll
get it. On the house, of course.”
“Thanks,” I tell her. “That's really nice of you.”
“Oh, please. It's nothing. I'm sure Lowell has a lot to do with it since
we went to high school together, but the Comets are always here supporting
me and bringing in so many customers, so it's the least I can do.” She gives
me another bubbly grin, then checks her watch. “Okay, got to run. Great
meeting you again, Emilia.” She looks to Smith. “I'll let Macie know you
loved her card.”
His scowl deepens, and she laughs, giving us a wave before hustling to
her car.
“I like her,” I say, watching her go. “She seems fun.”
“She is. She was super shy when I first started coming here, and it took
a while for her to warm up to me. We're good now though.”
I kind of picked up on that when Miller was here. There wasn't a lot of
eye contact, and I swear her hand was shaking as she gave him his coffee.
“Do the other guys come here often?”
He nods. “Yeah, but don't tell your uncle or anyone. We'll get in trouble
for eating too many donuts during the season.”
I slide my eyes over him, trying not to pay too close attention to the way
his simple gray t-shirt clings to his muscles. “I think you'll be just fine.”
“Stop checking me out, Ms. Anderson. We're here to work. This isn't a
date.”
There's a bite to the last word, and I wonder if I offended him by being
so quick to correct Scout about our relationship status. It's just that if the
other players are coming here often, the last thing I need is for her to say
something to one of them about Smith and me and have it get passed
around the locker room. That's how rumors start. That's how we get memos
sent out.
That's how people lose their jobs.
And by actually breaking the rules.
I shove down the thought, locking it tightly away in a box and pushing
it to the depths of my mind.
“Speaking of work…”
I pull a small travel-sized tripod from my bag and set it up, getting my
phone ready to make some short videos we can use across a few different
platforms. Then I pluck my tablet from my bag, clearing text notifications
from Blake and pulling up the questionnaire we've been slowly working
our way through over the past month. I scroll to find where we left off last.
“All right, so we left off with…” My voice trails off when I realize
Smith is staring at me, head tipped to the side, mouth set in a firm line.
“What? Do I have something on my face?” I reach up to check but find
nothing.
He shakes his head. “No.”
“Then what is it?”
“It's…” Another headshake. “Nothing.”
But it's not nothing. I know it's not nothing.
He's thinking about the same things I am, and I'm starting to wonder
just how much longer we're going to be able to keep our bubble alive.
He clears his throat, shifting on the bench. “So, where'd we leave off?”
“This question is from Kaden, age five,” I tell him, reading off the list.
“If you were a dinosaur, what kind would you be, and why would it be a Trex?”
Smith laughs. “Hard-hitting questions. I like it. So, I'd be…” He dives
into a very detailed explanation of his answer, and I love that he takes it
seriously.
We spend the next half hour going through the rapid-fire questions,
getting a good number of videos saved so we can spread them out and post
them over the next several weeks. Tori has been pleased with everything
I've gotten Smith to agree to so far. She has no idea it's because I've been
promising him blow jobs in exchange for content.
“All right,” I say once we reach the end of the list. “I think that's good
for today.”
“Yeah?” Smith rises from the table, stretching. “Does this mean you're
off the rest of the day?”
“Uh, no.” I laugh at the way he bounces his brows up and down and
start packing up my things. “I have to go back to the office and start editing
these, and you need to take a pre-game nap, Mr. Hockey Star.”
“We can nap together?” he tries, coming around the table to wrap an
arm around my waist and tug me close.
I hate the way my eyes scan the lot, making sure nobody is watching.
Thankfully, the place is totally empty now, and aside from Scout's sister in
the truck, we're alone. I sag against him, letting him press soft kisses into
my neck.
“Come on. Naps are way more fun with you.”
“That's because we don't nap!”
“True.”
He presses against me harder, and there is no mistaking the erection I
feel against my ass. He nips at my neck, then runs his tongue over the same
spot, licking away the sting from his bite. I tug my lip between my teeth,
trying to fight the moan that's threatening its way up my throat.
“It's not my fault,” he says into my ear, his fingers dangerously close to
slipping under my skirt. “You taste too good.” He grinds against me again.
“There's always now.”
“Hmm?”
“If you won't come home with me, there's always now. My truck is
pretty big, you know…”
I groan at the thought of straddling Smith in the back seat, riding him
until we're both exhausted.
“Emilia…”
A vehicle with music thumping loudly races into the parking lot, and it's
enough to pull me from my stupor. I wiggle out of his hold, and he lets me
go easily, not-so-subtly adjusting the bulge in his pants. I clear my throat,
pressing out the wrinkles in my clothes, then finish packing up my things.
We throw our trash away, and Smith's hand finds the small of my back
again as we make our way to his truck. It's a simple touch, a thoughtless
one, but it's still making my skin burn beneath his fingertips, and I wonder
if it'll always feel that way with him, if he'll always make me feel like I'm
constantly on the edge of something great.
He pulls the door open for me, helping me into the passenger seat.
“Smith?” I say, just before he's about to close the door.
“Yes?”
“Ten minutes, but that's it.”
He grins. “I only need nine.”

SMITH
“I'm sorry, but no. The remakes are better.”
I blink at her. “Oh, you poor, sweet, summer child. Jumanji is a classic.”
“Listen here, old man, just because it came from the eighties, doesn't
mean it's better.”
“It's not even from the eighties! It was released in 1995, and I
remember that because I took Stephanie Martinez to the dollar theater to see
it and we kissed.”
A little growl escapes her when I mention that last bit, and I admit it
brings me great satisfaction to see her jealous.
We had a home game tonight, which means Emilia is sleeping over. It's
been that way for over a month now. She comes over and some nights we
have dinner and talk, others we fuck, and some we just go straight to bed. I
don't know exactly when it started, but we both seem to be content with not
questioning it.
I'm too tired to cook after getting our asses handed to us by St. Louis,
so we're currently lounging on the couch. Emilia's popping French fries
into her mouth while I slowly eat a chicken Caesar salad as Robin
Williams' Jumanji plays in the background.
Even when she admits to having shitty taste in movies, I love having her
here. It feels natural, normal—and a lot like that thing that's been missing
for far too long.
“Godzilla!” she exclaims. “Puh-lease tell me you're at least team
Godzilla and not rooting for Kong.”
I shake my head. “I am so disappointed in you. There is no way. King
Kong all the way. Hell, it's in his name—he is king.”
“No.” It's all she says as she chucks the fry at my head. What she
forgets is that I'm a pro athlete and I have no problem snatching it out of the
air. I pop it into my mouth, grinning at her when she glares at me.
“Yes,” I say again.
She rolls her eyes. “You do realize there are scientists—actual
scientists!—out there who agree that Godzilla would whoop that ass,
right?”
“How do you know that?”
She shrugs. “I read the internet.”
“Yes, and the internet is never wrong.”
“Was it wrong about your butt?”
“What about my ass?”
“There's an Instagram account—HockeysBestButts—and all they do is
talk about hockey butts. Every year they do a playoff-bracket-style head-tohead battle with a bunch of polls to determine who has the best butt. This
year, you won. Well, your butt won.”
“My ass won?” She nods. “From the entire league?”
“Yep. It was down to you and Elias Hasselback from Vancouver. It was
close, but you squeaked out just ahead.”
“I…don't even know what to say to that.”
She laughs. “It's a compliment, trust me. Harper said Collin was very
upset that you beat him in the semifinals.”
“Well, that would explain the looks he's been sending me for the last
week. I'm totally going to give him shit for following the poll.”
“Apparently he was checking it obsessively. Make sure to throw that in
there too.”
I point at her. “Now that is good ammo to have in my back pocket.”
“You're welcome.” She shimmies her shoulders, popping another fry
into her mouth and tuning back into the movie.
But I don't. I watch her shamelessly, loving the way her face changes as
the movie plays out. The way her eyes spark and dim, how her nostrils
flare, and even when she huffs, annoyed at something in the plot.
It's crazy to me how well she fits into my life, how right this feels…
how I could get really used to this if I let myself.
“You know I can feel you staring at me, right?”
“You know I don't care, right?”
She laughs. “Kind of figured.” She stretches her arms over her head as
the credits of the movie roll across the screen. “Okay, so what's next?”
“Next is bed. It's late and I'm tired.”
“It's not that late.”
“Um, some of us are over thirty and played a hockey game today.”
“Some of us are old and boring too.”
I narrow my eyes at her. “You did not just call me old and boring.”
She looks pointedly at the puzzle strewn across my living room table.
I've picked the habit back up again, mostly due to Emilia's insistence, and it
didn't take me long to realize I missed it. I missed how I could just shut my
mind off and piece something together.
“Don't be hating on my puzzling, young lady.”
“What are you going to tell me next? To get off your lawn?”
I glower. She laughs.
But her laughter is gone when I spring from my end of the couch and
dart over, fitting my body over top of hers and pressing her into the
cushions. I slide her hands above her head, gathering her wrists in one hand,
holding them there.
“Are you looking to start something?” I ask, rolling my hips into hers,
letting her feel the erection growing beneath my sweats. She does that to
me, makes me hard and ready all the fucking time.
I know she joked about my refractory time, but with her, it's never an
issue. My body craves hers every minute of every day, and I can't seem to
get enough. Hell, I don't know if I ever will.
“Possibly,” she admits, biting down on her lower lip.
“You're insatiable, you know that?”
“Only when it comes to you.”
I grin, leaning down to press soft kisses against her neck. She sighs
when my lips meet her skin.
“That was a good answer,” I say against her.
“I know. Do you think it's earned me a reward?”
I laugh. “Insatiable.”
“Mhmm,” she agrees, arching up into me, seeking the friction I'm just
as eager to provide.
For a moment, I wonder if I'll ever tire of this—tire of being near her,
kissing her, feeling her beneath me.
I decide right then that, no, I won't, and somehow, that thought isn't as
scary as it should be.
I thrust against her again. “Do you want me to fuck you, Emilia?”
“I thought you'd never ask.”
She sighs when I nip at her neck, careful not to bite too hard so I don't
leave any marks, her hips meeting mine in sync.
“But, Smith?”
“Hmm?” I say into her.
“I call top this time.”
And I let her have it.
“Yo, Smith, your girlfriend is here.”
My head snaps up at Miller's words just in time for him to step out of
the way and see Emilia standing behind him.
“Shut up, Miller,” she mumbles, and I laugh at her uncharacteristic act
of unprofessionalism. She shakes her phone my way. “I'm just here for
content.”
“Again?”
She rolls her eyes, and it physically makes my hand twitch with the urge
to walk over there and smack her ass for the gesture. “Yes, again.”
“Here?”
She knows what I'm really asking. Are we going to be alone, or will
there be an audience?
“Wherever you're most comfortable.”
I glance around at the guys sitting at the table. Rhodes' face is buried in
his lunch, Wright's focused on his phone, Miller is staring off into space,
and Lowell is nowhere to be found.
Nobody is paying a lick of attention to us, but I still don't want to be
around them.
I want to be alone with Emilia.
“All right. I'll meet you at the truck in five.”
She tries to hide her grin, but I still see the corners of her lips twitch just
before she turns and struts away.
Against my better judgment, I watch.
And apparently, I'm wrong about nobody paying any attention because
Miller says, “I saw that.”
I glance over at him. “Saw what?”
“Your eyes on her ass.”
I narrow my eyes at him, then shrug it off. “It's a nice ass.”
“Yeah, but you're like a gentleman and shit. You don't look at women's
asses.”
He's so fucking wrong that it's almost funny.
I'm no gentleman. Especially not where Emilia's concerned.
“Shut up, Miller,” I echo her earlier words, rising from the table.
I grab my trash from my lunch and toss it, then dump my plate with our
kitchen staff.
“In a hurry?” Greer asks, stepping up next to me as I quickly scrape my
leftovers into the trash. “I saw that hot piece of ass head out of here.
Meeting her for a quickie in the parking lot?”
I want to knock his fucking teeth in for talking about Emilia like that,
but I know retaliation will be more telling than not.
“We're just working on that stupid player profile.”
“Right. Sure. Keep telling yourself that.”
“Fuck off, Greer.”
He laughs, but I ignore him.
I try to keep my steps steady and unhurried as I make my way toward
the parking lot.
I'm annoyed with Greer, but my frustration melts away the moment I
see her waiting at my truck, and I can't help the grin that stretches across
my face.
She's leaning against it and—a rare occasion for sure—her red hair is
blowing in the wind. Her toned legs mirror her crossed arms as she waits.
She's peering down at her phone with her brows pinched together in
concentration, her bottom lip tucked between her teeth, something I've
come to notice that she does often when she's really focused.
Her head lifts when she hears me approaching and that grin that teased
her lips in the dining hall comes back full force when she spots me.
I don't stop. Not until I'm crowding her against the truck.
“Hi,” I say, pressing into her.
“Hi.” She looks left, then right. “You do know we're in public, right?”
Shit. I forgot.
“I know. I'm just getting your door.” I reach around her and pop open
the passenger door.
“Smooth,” she says, ducking under my arm and climbing into the truck.
“I know we're in public, but am I allowed to tell you that your ass looks
incredible in those pants?”
She laughs. “I'll allow it.”
I jog around to the driver's side and hop in. I fire up the engine, then
pull out with a little more gumption than I typically do.
Neither of us speaks.
Not until I swing into a random parking lot just half a mile down the
road.
“What are you—”
I don't even bother whipping into a spot. I just throw the truck into park
and lean across the center console, pulling her to me and pressing my lips to
hers.
She sighs against me the moment our lips meet like she's been waiting
for this all day too. Never mind that I just saw her this morning when she
was leaving my bed at six AM. It feels like it's been years since I've
touched her rather than hours.
I have no idea how long we kiss. It could be only seconds, or it could be
thirty minutes. I just know when we part, we're both gasping for air.
“Is it too soon to say I missed that?” she asks.
“Only if I can say it too.”
She grins. “Do you mind if we stop by my apartment? I want to grab
different shoes. My feet are killing me today.”
“You want to go to your apartment?”
“If that's okay?”
“Of course,” I tell her, putting the truck back into drive and pulling from
the lot.
I know the general area she lives in but I've yet to go to her place. This
will be my first time and I'm anxious to see it.
She directs me to her place—which isn't too far from the rink—and I
find a spot to park out front.
Hand on the door, she turns to me and says, “No funny business. We're
just here for shoes.”
I hold my hands up innocently. “Wasn't even thinking about it.”
That's a lie.
I totally was.
I follow her up three flights—very much enjoying the view—then wait
patiently as she unlocks her door.
“It's not much,” she warns unnecessarily as she pushes inside.
We step into the place she's been spending a lot less time and she's
right, it's not much. But it's hers, which makes me automatically love it.
That and the distinct hint of lavender that I can smell at every turn.
The first thing I notice is how different it is from my place. I'll admit
that my apartment is decorated like a museum with very, very little décor,
but not Emilia's. There are touches of her around every square inch of the
place. From the vintage typography posters hanging on the wall to the
pictures of her and Hollis attached to a corkboard, to the bookshelf that's
overflowing with romance novels. It's exactly what I pictured when I
thought of her.
“I'll be right back,” she says, peeling her heels off, then darting down
the hall.
I follow her, watching as she slides open the door to her closet and
drops to her knees as she begins rifling around her shoes.
I'd be lying if I said naughty thoughts didn't filter through my mind the
moment her knees touched the carpet.
But I push them aside.
Since she has no interest in showing me the comfort of her bed, I help
myself.
She turns when she hears me flop down and narrows her eyes.
“I thought I said no funny business.”
“I'm not here for funny business.” I bounce up and down on the bed a
few times. “Just testing it out. For the future.”
“Uh-huh.” She still sounds like she doesn't believe me, not that I blame
her.
“I promise. I have a game tonight. I have to preserve my energy.”
She shoves to her feet. “I suppose that's fair.”
“Wait. Are you disappointed that I'm not trying to hit on you?”
She lifts her shoulders. “Maybe a little.”
I laugh. “Like I said, insatiable.” I pat the spot beside me. “Come. Lie
down.”
She eyes me skeptically.
“I meant what I said. No fooling around. Not right now.” I wink and she
shakes her head with a smile.
But she doesn't argue anymore. She hops up onto her bed, lying down.
“What are you…”
Her words die when I lift her feet into my lap and begin massaging the
right one.
She moans as I press my thumb into the middle.
“Oh god. That feels incredible.”
“Why do you wear those heels if they hurt? I mean, don't get me wrong,
they're incredibly sexy. But if they're painful, why?”
She shrugs. “They make me feel powerful. Important.”
“You don't need heels for that. You're already powerful and important.”
Another grin plays on her lips. “I'm glad you think so.”
“Know so,” I argue, pressing deeper into the spot.
She moans again and I do my best to subtly adjust the growing erection
in my shorts.
If she notices, she doesn't say anything. She just lies there and lets me
massage her feet.
I have no idea how long I knead my thumbs into her feet.
No idea how long I watch her enjoy every single moment of it.
But however long it is, it's worth every single second just to see the
pure bliss that's melting over her face.
I'd do anything she wanted to keep it there because seeing her happy
and making her feel good makes me happy and feel good.
“You keep this up and I just might start to like you, Owen,” she
murmurs quietly.
“Yeah? Might be a little late for me in that department, Emilia.”
She tucks her lips together like she's trying not to smile at that.
The craziest part? I mean it.
Wright passes the puck to Rhodes, who drags it around the back of our net
and sends it up the boards to Lowell. We race into Minnesota's zone with
numbers. Lowell dekes around two players, winds it up, and fires.
The puck goes wide, and I race to it, beating the Minnesota player, but
he shoves me against the boards, battling for the free puck. I win it back,
then swing it back over to Lowell, who takes another shot, and this time he
scores.
This ties the game three to three, but twenty seconds later, Minnesota
scores again, and it's a real fucking bummer for us, because the game is
over just five seconds later.
“Fuck!” Lowell screams out, beating his stick against the boards as he
heads down the tunnel.
He's upset, and I get it. I'm pissed too. There was no reason we
shouldn't have walked out of this game with two points we desperately
need. We were more rested. We were hungrier.
But in the end, it wasn't enough.
The race for the playoffs is tight, and we're sitting in a wild card spot
now. We don't have many more games on the schedule to get our shit
together, which is something we really need to do. We're sinking, and we're
going down fast.
I plop down onto the dressing room bench, sucking in gulps of air as I
try to catch my breath and mentally go over everything that went wrong in
the game. If we can't get it together, this season is going to be over sooner
than any of us want.
“That fucking sucked,” Miller complains, dropping down next to me,
his gear already halfway off.
I'm still fully dressed, too pissed to move just yet.
“Tell me about it,” I grumble. “We keep this shit up and we're losing
that wild card position.”
He makes a noncommittal noise next to me, his brows drawn tight.
“It'd help if you caught a pass,” Greer mutters. “Stopped daydreaming
about a certain redhead.”
It's said quietly, but I don't fucking miss it.
I flip him off. “Just like it'd help if we didn't have to play like there was
nobody in our net.”
He scowls, not liking the fact that he let in two soft goals when
Minnesota caught him sleeping.
It's stupid to get into a battle with him about it because really, it was all
of our faults that we lost. Miller could have taken more shots. Rhodes could
have had more hits. And Lowell and Wright could have worked harder
together.
Me? I could have stopped daydreaming about Emilia and what it would
be like to just be open and free with her.
We all fucked up, and it blows because every lost game is another lost
chance at the game. It's another game wasted in a season where I should be
savoring them, not squandering it all.
There's a damn good chance this could be my last year in a Comets
uniform. Hell, this could be my last year in any hockey uniform. I wanted to
go out with a fight, but it's really beginning to look like I might not even get
that chance, and I'm really not ready for that.
I'm not ready for a lot of things.
Especially not admitting that maybe—just maybe—I'm steadily falling
for Emilia.

EMILIA & SMITH
Smith: Tell me again why I'm sitting on a bus next to Miller
and not waking up next to you right now.
Emilia: Because you're getting paid millions of dollars.
Smith: Ah, right. That's it.
Emilia: And because for all you complain about him, you
secretly love Miller.
Smith: No. Not even close.
Emilia: Keep telling yourself that.
Emilia: How did you end up drawing the short stick again?
Smith: Because I have shit-ass luck.
Smith: It happens all the time.
Smith: I'm starting to think it's rigged.
Emilia: You could be onto something there.
Emilia: I definitely wouldn't put it past Collin, that's for sure.
Emilia: Or maybe even Lowell.
Emilia: I still can't believe he and Hollis are going to be
parents.
Smith: Tell me about it.
Smith: It feels like just yesterday he was strutting onto the ice
and now he's having a kid.
Smith: Time flies too fast.
Emilia: Don't be so dramatic, old man.
Smith: I might be old but I'm not too old to bend you over my
knee and spank your ass.
Emilia: Oooh is that a promise?!?!
Smith: Is that consent?
Emilia: Yes.
Emilia: I mean, I'm into it if you are.
Smith: Oh, Emilia. The things I'd like to do to you…
Emilia: Tell me them.
Smith: Did you miss the part where I'm sitting next to Miller?
Emilia: So?
Emilia: Hold your phone away.
Smith: I'd rather not get a boner sitting next to him.
Emilia: Please, Owen.
Emilia: I miss you.
Smith: I'd lay you down and spread those gorgeous legs of
yours so I can get a look at your pretty pussy.
Smith: Then, I'd devour you. Eat at you like a starved man
until you're begging for me to let you come.
Smith: But I wouldn't.
Emilia: That's just mean.
Smith: As mean as this is right now?
Smith: My fucking cock is rock hard, and Miller just asked why
I put my jacket over my lap.
Emilia: What do I have to do to come?
Smith: That's easy. You'll let me fuck your throat.
Emilia: God yes.
Smith: I'll watch your pretty mouth stretch around my cock
until tears are streaming down your face. And only after I fill
your pretty mouth with my cum, I'll flip you onto your back and
sink into you.
Smith: But only for a moment.
Emilia: WHAT?
Emilia: WHY?
Smith: Because I have more plans for you, Emilia.
Smith: Like watching your tight little asshole take my cock
while I fuck your pussy with a dildo.
Smith: Like watching your ass cheeks turn red from the sting
of my palm.
Smith: Like watching you beg for mercy.
Smith: There's so much more I want to do to you, but it's
getting really uncomfortable sitting here.
Emilia: Yes. Please. Now.
Emilia: I want it all.
Smith: Me too, baby. Me too.
Smith: Great. We just pulled into the rink and my dick won't go
down.
Emilia: Oopsie?
Smith: Thanks for the blue balls.
Emilia: *grins* You're welcome.
Smith: What are you wearing?
Emilia: Uh, khakis.
Smith: Are you even old enough to know that commercial?
Emilia: Everyone knows Jake from State Farm!
Smith: Okay, that's fair.
Smith: But seriously…what are you wearing?
Emilia: Wouldn't you like to know?
Emilia: (Also, it really is khakis.)
Smith: Is it bad if I say that's hot?
Emilia: You're totally picturing my ass right now, aren't you?
Smith: Guilty.
Emilia: Your goal was so beautiful!
Smith: Eh. That was all Lowell on the setup. I just got lucky.
Emilia: Hush and take the compliment, Smith.
Smith: Yes, ma'am.
Emilia: Oooh, you're right. That IS nice.
Smith: You finished?
Emilia: Not yet, but if you give me a few minutes, I'm sure I
can get there.
Emilia: ATTACHMENT
Emilia: All right, fine, it was less than a few minutes.
Smith: Fuck. Did you really just masturbate?
Emilia: I think the gleaming vibrator says it all, don't you?
Smith: I've never wanted to wish hockey games away so
damn badly before.
Emilia: Don't. You need the points.
Smith: Don't try to talk sense into me now.
Smith: Also, I kind of hate you right now. We're still on the bus
back to the hotel, and my cock is rock hard. There's no way I
can stand up without everyone seeing it.
Emilia: I'm not even a little sorry.
Smith: You think you're so cute being so sassy when you're
so far away.
Smith: Just remember that payback is a bitch.
Emilia: And I can't wait to meet her.
Emilia: Last game of the road trip. You guys got this.
Smith: If I score, do I get to see your titties?
Emilia: Just one.
Smith: Which one?
Emilia: Goal-scorer's choice.
Smith: The left. It's my favorite.
Emilia: What's wrong with the right one??
Smith: Nothing. The left one is just slightly bigger.
Emilia: It is, isn't it?
Emilia: That's the dominant tit.
Smith: You can have a dominant tit?
Emilia: Yes.
Emilia: It's a girl thing. Trust me.
Smith: I'll go ahead and believe you on that one.
Emilia: You should.
Emilia: Now go kick some ass for the titties.
Smith: *titty
Emilia: *dominant titty

EMILIA
Six hours.
That's how long I have to go until I get to see Smith again. The Comets
have been on a four-game road trip, and going so many days without seeing
Smith feels wrong.
I miss him.
I know I shouldn't because getting attached to him is a horrible idea, but
I can't help it. Spending time with him is quickly becoming my favorite
thing to do. It's not just the sex either—though that is incredible. It's more
than that. It's the nights we spend curled on the couch watching a movie, or
the times when I'll read while he does recovery on his quads with the
massage gun. And, okay, fine, it's also the nights when he strips me bare
and makes me beg for mercy.
Even though I'm more swamped than ever with work, I can't remember
a time when I've been this content. I feel good, happy, and there is
absolutely no denying that it's all because of Smith.
I wish I could bottle this feeling and keep it forever, especially since I
know that as long as he's playing for the Comets and I'm working for them,
it can never last.
Hollis' idea of who has to know works for now, but I know we'll never
be fortunate for it to last forever.
For now, I'm going to keep shoving down all the ways I know this is
wrong and enjoy all the right ones while our time bomb keeps ticking away.
“Emilia!”
My head snaps up at Tori's abrupt entrance. “Yes?”
“My office. Five minutes.”
Her words are short and clipped, but they always are. Her face is giving
nothing away either; it's almost like she's bored.
But I know that's not the case. The way her eyes are locked on me…
something is off, something I can't quite place my finger on, but whatever it
is, I know I don't like it.
I nod. “Okay.”
She tips her head, studying me. Then with a final nod, she disappears
down the hall.
I swallow back the dread that begins to work its way up my throat and
hit save on the posts I'm drafting. I rise from my desk, not missing the way
my legs wobble, and take a deep breath.
Does she know about Smith? Is that what this is? Am I getting fired?
No, no, no. There's no way for her to know. We've been careful,
professional every minute we're at work. Not a single slip up while we're
on the clock. If she knows, she's damn good at reading people.
Still…I'm nervous.
Tick.
I take a tentative step toward her office, then another. Several other staff
members are looking my way, some sending sympathetic smiles, and I
wonder for a moment if they can hear my heart trying to beat out of my
chest. If they can hear the hitch in my breath. If they know something I
don't.
“Psst!” I peek over my shoulder to find Blake poking his head out from
the break room. “What's going on?”
I shrug. “No clue.”
His eyes dart toward Tori's office, then back to me, and I hate the terror
I see in his eyes. “She seems off.”
Great—it's not just me picking up on that.
“Good luck,” he says, and I can see the sympathy and worry in his eyes.
I don't like that either.
Slowly, I continue to Tori's office, making sure not to rush but also not
taking too much time. Somehow, I know I'm already walking a fine line,
and I'd rather not make whatever this is any worse.
Tick.
“Close the door,” Tori says calmly when I step into her office, not
bothering to look up at me.
I press the heavy door closed, then take a seat opposite her. She
continues scribbling something while I try to hide the way my hands are
shaking. I fold them into my lap, hoping she doesn't catch it.
Only then does she set her pen aside and meet my eyes.
“Do you know why I asked you in here?”
To fire me. “Um…no?”
It comes out as a question, and by the lift of her brow, I know she
doesn't like it.
“As of the end of April, I will no longer work for the Comets
organization. I'll be going to the board on Monday to inform them of the
decision as well as to officially nominate you for the open director
position.”
Relief floods me, not just because this isn't about Smith and me, but
because I got it. It's not official yet since the board has to approve it, sure,
but with Tori's recommendation, it's nearly a sure thing.
“However, there is something we need to address.”
Tick.
I swallow.
She opens a drawer on her desk and pulls out a tablet. She sets it on her
desk, then folds her hands together, setting a sharp gaze on me.
“Is there anything you'd like for me to know, Emilia?”
Yes. I'm sleeping with Smith. I'm breaking rules. I'm not the dutiful
employee you think I am.
I should say all of that. I know that.
But…I don't.
Instead, I push my shoulders back and I tell her, “No.”
The corners of her mouth pull down at my answer, and she sighs. “All
right, then.”
She turns the tablet on, then swipes a few times before flipping it my
way and setting it in front of me. She dips her head toward it, but I don't
look.
I can't.
Because I have a feeling that whatever she's showing me is evidence.
And it's damning.
“You forgot to log out.”
BOOM!
My whole world explodes.
I close my eyes, trying to will away the tears that are stinging and
threatening to spill.
“How long?” she asks quietly.
“Over two years.”
She sucks in a sharp breath, and I finally peel my eyes open.
“I met him when I moved here. It was just a one-time thing. We didn't
exchange last names or talk about our jobs. When the next season rolled
around…” I trail off, remembering that crushing feeling when our eyes
caught across the room for the first time in months. “We didn't know, I
swear, and when we realized it, we didn't have any contact outside of work
and kept our contact at work to a minimum. I always had Blake cover
anything to do with him until…”
“The player profile.”
I nod. “Until then.”
She twists her lips together, studying me as she drums her fingernails on
the desk.
This is it for me. I know it is. I'm losing my job and everything I've
been working so hard for. My uncle is going to be so disappointed in me.
Hell, I'm disappointed in myself.
After what feels like hours of her just staring at me, finally, she sighs,
leaning forward.
“You're an incredible asset to this team, Emilia, and I truly believe so
much of our growth in the past year has been thanks to the fresh ideas you
bring to the team.”
I try hard not to let my mouth fall open. This is the nicest she's ever
been to me, and I'm shocked. And I'm just as shocked to see nothing but
compassion in her usually fiery gaze.
“What I'm about to say doesn't leave this room. Understood?”
I nod.
She clears her throat. “Maybe it's my pregnancy hormones talking or
maybe it's because I know I'm not going to find anyone else to do this job
as well as I have, but because of your dedication to this team and this
organization, and because I truly do think you are the best replacement, I
am willing to overlook this…transgression and give you the opportunity to
stay. However, if you stay, you need to know whatever it is you have going
on with Owen Smith is over. The board will not be as lenient and
understanding as me.”
This time, my jaw does drop, and I don't even bother trying to hide it.
She's…giving me another chance? If it is her hormones, I don't care. I am
not about to look a gift horse in the mouth.
“I—”
She holds her hand up, stopping me. “No. Don't say anything yet. Take
a night. Think it over. Make sure this is what you truly want. What you're
ready to give up. If it is, I'll go to the board on Monday with the
recommendation.”
I'm speechless. Part of me wants to scream at her that I don't need time
to think about it. This is what I want.
But I can't get the words to come out, and I'm not sure why. Possibly
because the idea of walking away from Smith again…it makes my stomach
sink.
We knew this day was coming. This thing we've been doing, this bubble
we've been living in…we knew it was temporary from the beginning.
Now, it's time to let it go.
Smith has been married to hockey his entire life. He knows what it's
like to want to give something your all.
He'll understand.
He has to…right?
I've been sitting in my car outside Smith's apartment for nearly thirty
minutes now. His game ended two hours ago, and by my calculations, he
should have gotten to his apartment just before I pulled up, which means he
should be upstairs waiting for me because that's what we do. That's our
routine.
Funny, because we were never supposed to have any of those, but we
do.
Did.
Yeah, I broke the rules and slept with a player. But my worst offense of
all? I got attached. I got attached, and now I have to let him go.
I don't want to let him go.
There's a sharp knock on my window, and I jump at the sudden
intrusion.
When my gaze focuses on what's in front of me, I realize it's Smith.
He's staring down at me with his brows pinched tightly, head tipped to the
side, probably completely confused as to why I'm just sitting in my car and
not racing up to his apartment to crawl beneath his sheets.
It's because I'm scared.
I'm scared if I go up there, I won't be able to do it. I'm scared if I go up
there, I'll want to stay. I'm scared if I go up there, I'm going to realize
everything I'm giving up.
And more than all of those reasons, I'm scared because if I go up there,
I just might realize I'm in love with him.
With a steadying breath, I step out of my tiny car. Smith holds open the
door for me. He offers me a hand, but I decline it. I probably shouldn't be
touching him. It's for the best.
I close the door, then rest against it, staring up at the building that holds
so many memories for me.
Smith's been to my apartment a few times, but having him there never
felt like it should. This place? This place feels right. It feels like home.
Or at least it used to.
He steps in front of me, his knuckles grazing under my chin as he tips
my face up to his, those damn watchful ochre eyes of his boring into me
and trying to find all my secrets.
I decide it's best to just rip the Band-Aid off.
“I talked with Tori today.”
His nostrils flare, and it's the only indication that he heard me.
“I got the promotion.”
He sighs with relief, much the same way I did in her office, then he
presses his forehead against mine, his hand crashing into my hair like it
always does.
“That's amazing, Emilia. I'm so proud of you.”
His words are genuine. I can tell they are, and it makes my heart hurt
even more.
“You deserve this. It's everything you've wanted. It's—”
“She knows, Smith.” I pull back, meeting his eyes. “She knows about
us.”
“Ho…” He shakes his head. “How?”
“I connected my phone to a tablet at work. We do it all the time so we
can get texts while we're working and not have to worry about carrying
around multiple devices, and I…I didn't disconnect it. Which means…”
My words trail off, but he nods, understanding where I'm going.
“Our texts. She saw our texts.”
“Everything. All of it. I'm so sorry.”
I try so hard to fight back the tears that are so close to spilling free, but
it's pointless. They fall anyway.
“Hey, shh. It's okay,” he says, pressing a kiss to my forehead and then
bending slightly to meet my eyes. “It's all right. I—”
“No.” I shake my head. “You don't get it. It's not all right. I—”
I watch it happen in real time, the truth hitting him. First, his eyes
darken, then his pupils dilate. His breaths change, coming in shorter,
sharper. And finally, he drops his hold on me, putting entirely too much
space between us.
“I'm choosing the job, Smith,” I tell him quietly. “I have to.”
He doesn't move. He doesn't even blink, and for a moment, I wonder if
he heard me at all.
Then, he blows out a heavy breath. “Okay.”
“Okay?” He nods, and it pisses me off for some reason. “Just okay?”
His eyes harden. “What do you want me to say, Emilia? You've already
made up your mind. This is what you wanted from the beginning, and now
you're getting it. I get it. I understand. I'm not some young guy who is
going to go off the handle about this. I'm too old for dramatics. It's your
job, and that's important. I understand.”
I knew he would, but for some reason, I can't help but wish he were a
little more upset about this, wish he cared more about losing me, wish he
wanted to fight for me.
But I know his hands are tied. He's a professional hockey player under
contract. Of course this was going to end like this. We always knew it
would.
I just didn't think saying goodbye would hurt this badly.
“It was fun, though, right?”
I hate his flippant tone. Hate the way he's standing there stoic and
unflinching. Like none of this hurts him. Like he's not feeling an ounce of
the same heartache I am.
Was this all in my head? Did I build us up to be something more?
I want to tell myself it's just a coping mechanism and he's just trying to
convince himself he doesn't care but deep down he really does.
But I'm not so sure.
All I know is that whatever bubble we've been hiding in, it's long gone.
And this time, it's for good.
When I walk into the arena, I shove my shoulders back and will myself not
to cry.
I managed to get my tears to stop long enough this morning to apply my
mascara and drive to work without wrecking. Hell, I didn't even cry until I
pulled into the parking lot.
Now that I'm here and walking through these doors, I want to cry again.
Usually, I'm eager to come to work. I love my job.
But right now? Right now, I hate it.
I hate it because I love it, and because I love it, I went and got myself
brokenhearted.
“Hey, kiddo. How's it going?”
I startle at the sudden voice of my uncle, surprised that when I glance to
my right, he's walking right next to me.
Was I so stuck in my head that I didn't hear him walking up?
“Good morning, Mr. Martin,” I tell him.
He frowns. “What'd I tell you about calling me that? It's...”
“Professional?” I counter with a grin.
“Weird. I understand calling the players by their last names, but not
your uncle.”
The smile on my face falls when he mentions the players because my
mind automatically goes to Smith.
Smith and the way his eyes changed right in front of me last night.
Smith and the way he let me walk away.
Smith and the way my heart broke leaving him there.
“Oh. What was that look for?”
“What look?”
“The frown that just popped up out of nowhere.”
“I didn't frown.”
Uncle Jared places his hand on my arm, pulling me to a stop. His sharp
eyes bore into me, and I hate how his stare penetrates the shield I've tried to
construct.
He knows something is wrong.
Then his eyes flash wide, and he grabs my arm, hauling me off to the
side of the hall, his brows tightly together.
He bends his head near mine, eyes dark and angry. “Did one of my
players do something to you? Did they hurt you?”
“What?” It comes out a squeak. “No! God, no. It's not that.”
I mean, it is. But not in the way he's thinking. And really, did he hurt
me? Or did I hurt myself? I knew getting involved with Smith was a bad
idea from the start. I set myself up for this heartbreak.
“Are you sure? Because I swear to god, Emilia, I'll—”
“No,” I cut him off. “It's…no. Nobody did anything to me, Uncle Jared.
It's fine. I'm fine.”
Now he's the one frowning. “I don't like you lying to me, kiddo.”
I can't help but grin because of course he knows I'm lying to him. He's
been my rock for most of my life. He can sense it.
“I got the promotion,” I tell him. “I'm on my way to tell Tori right now
that I accept it.”
“What?” The biggest smile I've ever seen replaces his frown. “That's
fantastic! You deserve it!”
“I know.” I nod, agreeing with him because I do deserve it.
His smile falters, and it's always funny to see him slip into protective
parent mode when he's not technically my parent.
“You don't look happy about it. Why not?”
“It's just…” I blow out a breath. “I'm going to have to give up a lot for
it.”
“Your free time?” He laughs lightly. “Tell me about it. Working for an
NHL team is no joke. But I know you can handle it. If you want to, of
course.”
I swallow the lump that's been forming in my throat.
He doesn't miss it.
“Do you want to?”
“Yes!” Another loud squeak. I clear my throat. “Yes,” I say again
quietly. I nibble on my bottom lip, trying to figure out the best way to talk
to him about this without spilling my secret. Smith's secret. “Of course I
want to. It's just…if I take this job, things will have to…change.”
His brows are back to the same concerned position as before as he
processes my words. “I'm not entirely sure I'm following.”
I think I'm falling for your player.
I think I'm falling for your player, and I have no business falling for
him.
I want so badly to confess everything to him, but I'm not sure I'm ready
for his I'm not mad, just disappointed look I know I'll get.
So, I don't tell him.
“I think I'm just being silly.” I wave my hand flippantly. “Nerves, you
know? Big changes and all that.”
He tips his head to the side, watching me. All I can do is pray he
believes it and lets it go because I genuinely don't know much longer I can
stand here and not fall apart in front of him. Especially if he keeps looking
at me like he is.
Slowly, he straightens his head, then exhales heavily.
“I'm going to give it to you straight, all right?” I nod. “It's not going to
be easy. In fact, it will probably really suck for a while. But it will get
better. One day, you'll wake up, and everything with just be easier. It won't
feel so heavy. It'll be like it was before. If anyone can endure this, it's you.”
His words strike me in the chest like a missile hitting its target.
I know he thinks this is still about the promotion but his words… His
words work on a level he's not even aware of.
And they are everything I needed to hear.
“You're strong, kiddo. Stronger than you give yourself credit for.
You've got this.”
His confidence in me astounds me, because it reminds me of the same
faith Smith has in me. And everything hurts all over again.
But of course I can't tell him that.
Instead, I give him the best grin I can muster and say, “Thanks, Uncle
Jared. I…I needed that pep talk. I'm going to talk with Tori.”
“I think that's a good idea. Maybe dinner one night this week?”
“Sure.” I give him another wobbly grin, then step around him, heading
for the elevators.
I'm several feet away when he calls my name again.
“Yeah?” I ask, turning back.
“I'm always here for you, kiddo. Always. No matter what.”
There's something in his words that makes me think he might
understand more of what's going on than I think.
That's not possible, though, and I know that.
“Thanks,” I mutter, and he nods.
I don't hang around, hustling toward the elevator at the fastest speed I
can without making it look like I'm running away, which I am.
As luck would have it, the elevator is just a floor away, and I rush onto
it faster than I ever before, letting out a long breath when the doors close
and I'm alone.
I didn't like the way he was watching me. Like he just knew I was lying
to him.
I really, really hate lying to him.
But what's the point in telling him now? The thing with Smith…it's
done. We're done.
The car arrives on the social media floor as if it's a sign.
With a steadying breath, I exit the car and make my way to Tori's office,
forcing my head up high as I rap my knuckles three times against the
intimidating door in front of me.
“Come in!” I hear.
I push the door open and then walk inside Tori's office. I don't bother
sitting down, choosing to stand.
This won't take long anyway.
When she realizes it's me standing there, she sits back, hand going to
the bump protruding out of her belly, a reminder that soon she won't be
here and it will be me sitting behind that desk.
“Well?” she says by way of greeting, clicking the pen in her hand
several times, waiting eagerly for my answer.
I shove my shoulders back, tipping my chin up. “I'm in.”
“Good. That's good.” A grin curves her lips, and she looks incredibly
satisfied by my choice. “Effective immediately, you're no longer working
on the player profile. Blake will take over the project, and you will start
shadowing me so we can make this transition as smooth as possible for all
involved. Understood?”
I nod. “Yes.”
“Excellent.”
She ducks her head back down, returning to whatever it was she was
working on before, and I know enough to understand that means our
meeting is over. I head for the door, and just as I'm about to pull it open,
she calls my name.
I spin around. “Yes?”
“For what it's worth, I think you're making the right decision.”
I give her a tight smile and then close the door. I press my back against
the wall just beside it, holding my hand to my chest, my heart feeling like
it's about to leap out of my chest.
If it's the right decision, why does it feel so damn wrong?
23
SMITH
She took the job.
She took the fucking job.
I knew it was coming all along, but it doesn't make it hurt any less.
I've tried hard to keep my feelings out of things because I knew from
the start that at the end of the day, if I'm playing for the Comets, there's no
way what we were doing was going to last. It would be a lot different too if
I could actually be mad at her for taking the job. I can't be. She deserves it
so much, and it would be easier if she didn't.
“Thanks for meeting with me,” I say to Lowell as we park our asses on
a picnic table.
“You look like ass,” Lowell says in greeting as I sit down across from
him. “And that's saying something coming from the guy with a newborn at
home.”
It's been a week since I've seen Emilia, and a lot has changed in that
time. For starters, Hollis and Lowell had their baby, and she's perfect.
Second, Emilia is no longer spearheading the player profile. I've been
working with Blake to wrap up all the social media posts and the final
segments of the big interview that's set to air on our channels and local
news stations in two weeks. With the playoffs—which we barely squeaked
into—just a week away now, we're down to the wire on time, and I've
admittedly been putting it off.
I like Blake. He's a cool dude.
But he's not Emilia.
I miss her. Her laugh, her smile, that fucking hair I love wrapping
around my fist. I miss her sass and the way she confidently enters a room. I
miss having her in my apartment and having her scent on my sheets. I miss
her eyes and the way she screams my name.
I miss everything about her, and I have no fucking clue if I'll ever stop.
This wasn't supposed to mean anything. Just like that first weekend we
had together wasn't supposed to mean anything.
But it did.
It does.
And I have no clue how to cope with that.
“This about her?” Lowell asks as if he can read my thoughts.
I want to ask him who her is.
But that would be insulting.
Lowell isn't stupid. He sees the way I look at Emilia.
I sigh, then nod. “Yeah.”
He opens his box of donuts and then offers me one. I shake my head.
I've not had the appetite for much lately, but I really can't stand the sight of
the chocolate cherry donut he's offering me right now. It reminds me too
much of her.
“I figured.” He takes a sip of his coffee. “All right, let's hear it. Start
from the beginning.”
So, I do. I tell him everything from meeting Emilia the summer we lost
the Cup to her promotion to breaking all the rules and Christmas and
everything that came after that.
He listens, giving nothing away if he's surprised by any of it. When I'm
done, he just sits there, staring at me.
And still staring.
Still. Fucking. Staring.
Finally, I snap. “What?”
He laughs. That motherfucker laughs.
“Dude,” he says, shaking his head, “you are so damn in love with her
it's ridiculous.”
“You fucking think?” I grumble.
I know I'm in love with her. That's not that difficult to figure out, not
with the way she makes me feel.
It's the being with her part that I can't seem to nail down.
“You know this is the dumbest thing you've ever done, right?”
“I'm…aware.”
“She's Coach Martin's niece.”
“I know.”
“She works for the Comets.”
I grit my teeth together, annoyed with him stating the obvious for a
second time. “I know.”
“She's the best friend of the woman I just had a child with. Of the
woman I love.”
“I know. What the fuck is your point?”
He shrugs. “Just letting you know you're dumb as shit.”
I groan because he's not wrong. “I know.”
He laughs lightly, even though there's not really any humor to it.
He knows this isn't the best situation for me to be in. He knows I'm
screwed.
“Why didn't you tell me?”
I shrug. “You said it yourself. Who she is in relation to the team. To
Coach Martin. To Hollis. It wasn't…ideal. Plus, you've had your own shit
going on with the baby.”
He nods. “Yeah, that's fair, I guess. But I'm always here, you know?”
“Yeah,” I say, looking out at the mostly empty parking lot, watching
Scout clean off the tables. She left us to ourselves this morning, almost like
she knows we need the space.
I know Lowell is always there for me. But I also understand that this
whole mess is something I got myself into—no sense in dragging him into
it too.
“Look,” he says after several minutes of silence and one donut. I turn
my attention back to him. “I'm going to tell you something you're not
going to like, okay?”
“On a scale of one to punching you, how much am I not going to like
it?”
“Probably about a five. No—a six. Maybe seven. We'll see.”
I motion for him to continue.
“You put your life on hold for hockey, right? The game has been your
mistress for as long as you can remember. It's all your life has been, but
now that game you love so much is turning its back on you. It's getting
faster, and the competition is getting younger, fresher. It's pushing you
away and you're trying to hold on to it for dear life, squeezing everything
you can from it. But…” He shrugs. “Maybe you shouldn't. Maybe it's time
for you to be done.”
His words hit hard, because they're everything I've been stuffing down,
too afraid to face.
“You said if I had a chance at a family and at love, I should lay my heart
on the line and take it,” he continues. “Well, maybe you should too. Maybe
you should stop holding on to something that doesn't love you the same
way it used to. Take a chance on something new—on someone new.”
I hear what he's saying. I really do.
But it's hard, and fucking terrifying if I'm being honest. Giving up
hockey would be like giving up breathing—it's impossible to do. The game
is my oxygen, and I need it to live. Even if I did somehow find a way, the
fact is, at the end of the day, that doesn't change the reality that Emilia
chose the job and not me.
“She picked the job though,” I say.
He shakes his head. “I thought you were supposed to be older and
wiser.”
I narrow my eyes at him.
He's unfazed. “Just because she didn't choose you, Smith, doesn't mean
you can't choose her.”
Choose her.
It seems like such a simple thing but feels so damn big and scary at the
same time.
He drains his coffee and then rises from the bench. “Look, I have to get
back home to my baby, but I'm going to tell you the same thing you told
me: tell her. Tell her you love her. Tell her you wanted her to choose you.
Then, choose her.”
“Want to know what's bullshit?”
I glance up from the book I'm currently reading—I don't know what it
is, something random I picked up yesterday at the store down the block
from the hotel—just in time to see Coach Martin flop down into the empty
seat next to me.
It's brave of him considering I've been in such a shit mood lately that
not even Miller wanted to sit next to me today. I take pride in that defeat.
It's early morning, and we're on a bus in Philly heading to the rink for
practice. It's quiet, and nearly everyone is still half asleep. We're not
typically the chitchatting type, but here Coach is, in front of me with a grin,
clearly fishing for conversation.
So, I bite.
“What's that, Coach?”
“Rules.”
I was already on edge from losing the game last night, but that singular
word has my heart hammering in my chest so loudly that I'm almost sure he
can hear it.
Rules? Like the ones I broke by falling for his niece?
Like the ones I'd happily break again and again if it meant having
Emilia back?
Because, yeah, those rules are bullshit.
I close the book, clearing my throat and shifting around until I sit up
straighter. “Rules?”
He nods. “Yep. That offside rule screwed us last night, huh? You had
that entire team beat. The goalie too. But…rules.”
Oh. That's what he's referring to.
“Yeah, kind of brought down the whole team.”
“Don't get me wrong here. I understand the offsides rule and why it's
necessary. But sometimes a guy on the ice makes a play that's so damn
beautiful and dangles around half a team to score, only for the goal to get
called back. Bullshit, right?”
Considering I've been on both sides of that rule, I can agree. “Bullshit
for sure, Coach.”
“Mhmm.” He nods, glancing around the bus at the other players.
Collin has his phone up to his ear, talking softly to Harper, I'm sure.
Lowell is on a video chat with Hollis and the baby, though nobody is
talking. He's just staring at his sleeping daughter. And Rhodes is glaring at
Miller, looking about two seconds away from strangling the idiot who is
rambling on about something animatedly like he's not about to get
murdered.
Everyone else is either buried in their phone or sleeping.
After several minutes, Coach looks back my way. “Say, how's the
player profile going? I heard Blake is taking over for Emilia since she got
promoted.”
Emilia.
I've tried hard not to think about her, but I've failed at every attempt. I
can't get her out of my mind. Not even when we're out on the ice, which is
probably why I went in offsides last night and caused a nearly ten-minute
delay while they reviewed it.
It was painful to sit through, but not nearly as painful as knowing that
whatever I had with Emilia is done.
I rub at my chest when the truth of that hits me again.
He doesn't miss the gesture.
“He did,” I answer. “It's going well. Almost finished.”
“Good. That's good. We need you focused for the Playoffs anyway. It
was nice having her around, though, wasn't it? She's one of the good ones.”
One of the good ones? She's the fucking best one.
“Yeah,” I agree. “She is.”
“I love seeing her happy, and her work makes her happy.”
It does. It makes her so damn happy, and while I love that for her, I hate
it for me. For us.
“You remind me of her sometimes, you know?”
My brows crush together. “I do?”
“Yeah. Or maybe she reminds me of you.” He shrugs. “Either way,
you're similar. Always working hard and giving up so much for your jobs.”
Guilty and guilty. I know we both give our all to this organization.
“Sometimes maybe a little too much,” Coach says quietly.
I don't know if he's talking about Emilia or me or both of us. Either
way, his words ring true. We've both chosen our jobs time and time again.
Maybe a little too often like he suggests.
“I've done that before too, you know. I chose my job often. Over things
I had no business putting up for questioning, like time with Maxine.”
He smiles, but it's filled with sadness from bringing up his late wife.
I'm familiar with it because it's the same smile I've given since I
watched Emilia walk away. Sure, I didn't lose Emilia like he lost his wife,
but she's still gone, and it still fucking hurts.
“If I could go back, I'd choose differently. I'd choose her.”
He says the last three words quietly, but I hear them the loudest.
Choose her.
His words hit me right in the chest because he's not the only one who
has said them.
“Anyway,” he says, pulling my attention back to him, “just thought I'd
check-in and see how you're doing with…everything.”
When I don't say anything right away, he laughs lightly.
“You know. The player profile and the game last night.”
Right. That everything.
But I have a sneaking suspicion that we're not talking about the player
profile or even offsides rules anymore.
Maybe we never were.
He nods to the book in my hand, a greenish cover with a golden swirl
on top of a pair of legs. It's a weird cover for a weird book.
“You'll have to let me know your thoughts. If you're team letter or
manuscript.”
“Sure thing, Coach,” I say, though I have no clue what he's talking
about.
I watch as he stands and ambles his way to the back of the bus, leaving
me alone with my thoughts.
What the hell was that? Does he know about Emilia and me? Was he
just testing me? Or was he just making weird conversation?
I don't know.
All I know is that he is right about something. Something that keeps
hitting me in the face over and over again.
Something I need to do.
I need to choose her.
And I think I know what I need to do for that to be an option.
I don't let myself think about it as I rise to my feet and make my way to
the front of the bus.
“You mind if I sit here?”
Coach Heller looks up from his iPad, tugging his reading glasses to the
end of his nose. “Not at all.”
“Thanks,” I mutter, tossing myself into the seat next to him. “Can I ask
you something, Coach?”
“You can ask me anything—except a math question.” He grins. “I suck
at math.”
“How did you know it was time to hang up your skates?”
His brows rise. “It was just one loss, Smith.”
I don't grin back at him, and his smile slips from his lips, the reality of
what I'm asking him sinking in. It's entirely too early to be having a serious
conversation like this, but I need to have it now before I chicken out.
He sighs. “I don't know. Sometimes it's slow and it dawns on you over
time. Sometimes it hits you out of nowhere and you're just ready to be
done. It's just a feeling you get, something in your heart telling you it's
time.”
“How did you know when to listen to it?”
“I'm not sure there's an answer for that. Some people never listen to it,
and they just sort of fade away from the league but never the game.”
I know what he means. There are guys out there who haven't ever
officially retired but aren't in the NHL anymore. They're either playing
abroad or hoping one day, somehow, a team will call them up again.
I don't want to be that guy. If I'm going to be done, I want to be done. I
don't want there to be any questions left unanswered.
“Is there…something I should know, Smith?”
I shake my head. “No, Coach. Not yet.”
“All right.” He eyes me warily. “But if there is something on your mind,
I'm here for anything.”
“Unless it's math.”
“Fucking hate math.” He laughs heartily. “Look, kid, I'm not sure if this
conversation has been much help, but I just want you to know I understand
what you're going through. You'll figure it out. When it's time, you'll
know. Just…give me a heads-up, yeah? I'll need to adjust the lines.”
I laugh. “Sure thing, Coach.”
“For what it's worth, I've seen you give your all to this game over the
years. You've sacrificed a lot, and the game has taken too much time from
you, controlled your life in a lot of ways because you let it—because it's
easier that way.” He gives me a knowing look. “Maybe it's about time you
take back the reins.”
I can't help but think of my conversation with Lowell. About how he
said I was holding onto the game that doesn't love me the way I love it.
Maybe they're on to something.
Maybe it is about time I took back the control, and I think I know just
the way.
We pull into the rink, and the guys start piling off the bus. Coach gives
me one last long look before following suit.
I pull my phone out of my pocket and tap the most recently added name
on my contact list.
“Hello?”
“Blake,” I say. “Do we still have time to film another piece?”
“Uh…yeah?” It comes out a question. “I mean, we really need to get
things to editing, but if there's something you want to add, we can make it
happen.”
I'm scared to leave the game. Afraid to move on. I don't know who I am
without hockey, and I don't even know if I will like that version of me.
But…part of me is ready to meet him.
Part of me is ready for something more.
And just maybe, that something more is Emilia.
“Good. I have an idea…”
24
EMILIA
“I love my baby, I love my baby, I love my baby,” Hollis chants over and
over.
I try not to laugh as she tries not to gag at whatever it is baby Freddie—
named after Freddie Mercury since she and Lowell are both in love with
Queen—just did in her diaper. How something so little can make something
so stinky, I have no idea.
Hollis forces a smile as she looks down at the awful-smelling newborn.
“She's the greatest thing ever, and I love her so much.” Freddie lets out a
little yawn, and Hollis' smile isn't so forced anymore. “You're lucky you're
cute, missy.”
There's a tug at my chest watching Hollis with her daughter, and it
makes me miss Smith all over again. Walking away from him was the
hardest thing I've ever had to do, but no matter how much I miss him—and
I really fucking miss him—it was the right thing.
The board approved Tori's motion to promote me, and I'm the new
Carolina Comets media relations director.
Me!
I still can't believe it. I can hardly think about what it took to get here,
but it was just too big to say no to. It's what I've been busting my ass for
over the last three years, right? I couldn't give up on it now, and certainly
not because of some guy.
But…he's not just some guy, is he? He's more than that, and I'm afraid
he always will be.
We haven't spoken since that night outside his apartment. Tori cut off
all contact, having Blake step in for the profile and other staff members take
over some of my old duties while she finished prepping me for the
promotion.
I won't lie—at first, I regretted saying yes. Not just because my heart
was threatening to burst out of my chest every time I stepped into the arena
and had to see his face, but because the workload was massive. Tori wasn't
kidding when she said I'd better be ready to sacrifice. Guess I got a lot
more than I bargained for on several fronts there.
I rub at the ache that seems to permanently be in my chest.
Hollis doesn't miss it.
“Have you heard from him?” she asks, picking up Freddie and cuddling
her to her chest once she's finished changing her diaper.
I shake my head. “No. Not since they pulled a Toronto and lost in the
first round.”
Her face scrunches up. “What does this have to do with Canada?”
I wave her off, sometimes forgetting she doesn't know hockey very
well. “Nothing.”
She shrugs. “Have you reached out to him at all?”
“No. I…I can't.”
A frown tugs at her lips. “I get that.” She narrows her eyes. “Don't think
I'm not still mad at you, by the way.”
I repress my sigh. “I know, and I'm still sorry.”
“I just wish you would have confided in me.” She adjusts Freddie,
slipping her into a baby sling that's strapped to her chest. Freddie snuggles
into her mom, a little grin on her lips.
“I wanted to. So badly, I really did. But with Lowell and you and
everything else…” I lift my shoulders. “Well, I was kind of in a tough
spot.”
After the board approved the promotion, I told Hollis everything, the
whole long, sordid tale.
Understandably, she was upset I kept it from her for so long, but she did
say she suspected for a while that something might have happened between
us.
“I know.” She nods. “I understand.” She tosses Freddie's diaper into the
trash can and then pulls the bag out so my office doesn't start smelling.
“Walk this down to the dumpster with me?”
With the Comets done for the season, there are not a lot of people
bustling around the office. It's always weird having the place be so empty,
but it doesn't stop me from still coming in.
Truthfully, I do it because if I don't, I'll have entirely too much time on
my hands to think about things I shouldn't be. Today was going to be an off
day, but Hollis asked if I could get her access to the arena because she
wanted to take some photos with Freddie.
I jumped at the chance to spend time with them.
“Have you heard the rumors?” Hollis asks once we're in the elevator.
“You're going to have to be more specific. This is hockey—there are a
lot of rumors in hockey.”
“About him…about Smith.”
I wince when she says his name like it physically hurts, and if the spot
aching in my chest again is any indication, it does.
“No.”
“They're talking retirement.”
I snort out a laugh as the elevator descends. “Right. Sure.”
Smith retire? Not yet. He sure as hell wasn't playing in the playoffs like
he was planning to be done. He laid some heavy hits and got four assists
and one goal before the team was eliminated. He was playing like he was
ten years younger.
Besides, I'm the media relations director—I'd know if a player was
retiring.
“Hmm” is all Hollis says.
We make our way from the elevators and through the building, all the
way around the concourse to the trash shoot, and dump it in.
“Did you want to set up any photos against the ice backdrop?
Everything is still up and painted. We were doing some promo stuff in there
yesterday, but it's getting torn out tomorrow.”
She taps her fingers against her chin. “Actually, that doesn't sound like
a bad idea. I could—”
There's a loud click that echoes throughout literally the entire building,
then the sound of static fills the silence.
I look around the hall to see where it's coming from, and every single
TV as far as I can see is on. Epic music begins to play, and the Comets logo
flashes across the screen.
I give Hollis a what the fuck is going on look, and she just shrugs.
“No clue,” she mutters.
The picture on the screen looks familiar, and it takes me a moment to
recognize the makeshift set we use to do player interviews. There are soft
footfalls, then a player walks into view, and I don't even have to see a clear
picture to know who it is.
Smith.
The camera focuses as he takes a seat on the empty stool, and my chest
aches at the sight of him.
“State your name and position,” I hear my own voice say, and I know
right away what's playing.
“My name is Owen Smith. My position is…” His eyes drift just to the
right and away from the camera.
God, I couldn't see it then, but I do now. The look he gives me is…
“Holy shit,” Hollis mutters. “No wonder you banged him.”
I laugh.
“Centerman,” screen Smith says.
Then the commercial for this interview begins to play.
Even though I was there nearly every step of the way, I watch with rapt
attention as clips and sound bites from the months-long profile we did with
Smith fill the screen. There's video of him skating and setting his
teammates up for a record number of assists, footage of him at Scout's
Sweets and volunteering during our charity days. There are even a few clips
of him cooking the crew breakfast at his apartment right after Christmas.
Despite his uncertainty being on camera, he looks incredible in every
clip, and more than once I catch his eyes drifting away from the cameraman
and to me.
“Here,” Hollis murmurs, holding out a napkin for me.
I take it and dab at my eyes; I didn't even realize I was crying.
I'm crying for so many reasons. Because I'm so damn proud of him.
Because I wish things were different.
Because I miss him.
Because I think I might love him.
The screen fades to black, and I look at Hollis again, feeling a little
ridiculous for crying but not seeing any judgment in her eyes.
“You okay?” she asks.
I nod. “I'll be fine. That was the commercial for his profile airing
tomorrow. I don't know why it was playing now, but I was not expecting
that.”
“Yeah, that was weird. I—”
“Okay, seriously, Miller. Just stand there and be the cameraman.”
Smith's voice echoes around the empty hallways again.
My eyes jump back to the TVs, watching as someone—I assume Miller
—skates backward, training a camera on a scowling Smith.
“I swear I'm going to punch you.”
“Nope. You can't. You hurt me, and I'll sue for assault. I can do that
now.”
“This was a really bad idea,” I hear Blake say somewhere off camera.
“Nah. It's going to look sick,” Miller assures him, though he's dead-ass
wrong.
If he means dizzying and awful, then yes, it will look “sick” for sure.
His hand appears in front of the camera.
“Three! Two! One! ACTION!” he shouts, his fingers miming the
numbers.
When Smith just stands there, glaring, Miller sighs, dropping the
camera to his side, and I hear Blake squeak, probably worried about the
costly equipment I know he doesn't have permission to be using.
“Look, dude,” Miller says, skating closer to Smith. “Don't just stand
there looking like a dinosaur from Jurassic Park all rawr and shit. Talk!
Tell that woman you love her or all of this will be for nothing, and that'll be
annoying because I had chel plans today.”
“What's shell?” Hollis whispers as if they can hear us.
“Chel,” I correct. “Hockey slang for the NHL video game. Say it fast
and it sounds like chel.”
She screws her nose up. “Uh, but he plays in the NHL—why not just do
the real thing?”
“Who knows.” I shrug. “Boys are weird.”
Miller and Smith continue to argue, and it's becoming more and more
apparent that neither of them is aware the camera is on.
“Yeah, buddy!” I hear someone shout, and it sounds a lot like Rhodes.
“We have shit to do today! Let's get a move on.”
“Pitter-fucking-patter,” another voice—definitely belonging to Collin—
adds.
“Hollis can only distract her for so long,” Lowell chimes in. “And I
want to snuggle my baby.”
“See? Shit to do. Just be like, ‘Hey, hot tits,'” Miller says, imitating a
deep voice.
Smith's growl is very audible. “Miller…”
“Fine. ‘Hey, hot ass, I retired from the NHL for you, and I love you and
shit. Want to get out of here and bone?' And that's it. That's all you have to
say.”
I gasp.
Smith…retired?
I don't think. I just run.
I run right out into the rink.
When I reach the top of the stairs, I pause, and there he is, standing
center ice, scowling at Miller, who is trying to shove the camera back in his
face.
“Smith!”
He looks up, and his whole face transforms. Gone is the scowl, replaced
by pure love and adoration.
And it's all for me.
“You retired?” I shout.
He nods. “This morning! The press release goes out tomorrow, but I
thought—”
“Hey, can you come down here? I don't think the camera is picking up
the audio very well,” Miller yells, pointing it at me.
And I start running all over again. Down the stairs, dodging through
seats, not stopping until I'm sliding onto the ice, looking like a newborn
calf slipping around.
Smith is there to catch me before I can fall.
“Thank fuck,” he mutters, wrapping me in his arms and crushing his
mouth to mine.
Just like that, everything is right in my world again. I sag against him,
relishing the way his body feels against mine, the way we fit so perfectly
together. It makes me want to cry.
“Oh, thank fuck!” Rhodes calls. “I'm out of here.”
I faintly hear the other guys mutter something similar.
“Please don't fire me!” Blake says from somewhere, his voice getting
smaller and smaller as he likely follows everyone else down the tunnel. “I
need this job, and Nate can't strip, remember?”
He laughs nervously, and then we're alone.
Only then does Smith pull his mouth from mine. He looks down at me,
his tawny-brown eyes that I love so much bouncing between my green
ones, a smile tugging at his lips.
“Hi,” he says quietly.
“Hi. You really retired?”
“I really did.”
“But…why?”
“Because I choose you.”
My breathing stutters at his words. “You choose me?”
He nods. “I've had my chance to chase my dream of playing the
greatest game in the world. Now, it's your turn to chase yours.”
“But—”
He shakes his head, cutting me off. “No. No buts, not even hockey ones
—not about this. I've thought about it a lot, and this is what I want. You're
what I want.”
I sigh, and he laughs just before pressing his lips to my mouth again.
He runs his nose along mine when he pulls away. “I love you, you
know?”
“I know.”
“Like really, really love you. I have for a while, I think. Hell, maybe I
even fell that first weekend.”
“I think that's a real possibility. I'm very loveable, and I give great
head.”
He chuckles. “That so?”
“Yes.” I give him a quick peck on the lips. “You're not with the Comets
anymore… Which means we wouldn't be breaking any rules…”
“I'm not playing for the Comets anymore,” he clarifies, “but I do plan to
keep working with the team unofficially.”
My heart sinks. “What…what does that mean for us?”
“Not a damn thing. We're good.”
“We are?”
He nods. “Yes. I read that handbook forward and back. I'm not part of
the organization, so we can do whatever we want.”
I let out a relieved sigh. “That's the greatest thing I've ever heard.”
“Yeah? Did you miss the part where I said I love you?”
“Possibly. You're going to have to repeat it a few more times.”
“I.”
Kiss.
“Love.”
Kiss.
“You.”
Kiss.
“So damn much, Emilia. I didn't realize I was missing something so
important in my life until you. I didn't realize that I could feel this way
about anything other than hockey until you. I didn't realize that I wanted
more out of life than hockey until you. But I do. I want it all. A future.”
I sigh. “I haven't been the same since our first weekend together. I've
been trying to deny it and pretend and bury myself in work, but I should
have known it was useless. I had no chance at fighting it. Not really. Not
when you make me feel the way you do. I love you, and I want that future
too. Everything. All of it.”
“Yeah?” he asks.
I nod. “Yeah.”
Our mouths crash together again, and we don't let up, not until I'm
shivering in Smith's arms, the cold of the ice seeping into my bones.
“Come on. Let's get you out of here,” he says, leading me toward the
exit.
“What exactly were the guys here for?”
Smith shrugs. “No clue. That was all Miller.”
“To take your sorry ass to the bar if she decided she didn't want your
saggy old man balls!” Miller calls out, and we turn to find him sitting on the
bench, still recording.
“Miller…” Smith growls, turning toward him.
“Oh shit!” The kid takes off running as fast as he can on skates, dashing
down the tunnel for safety.
Smith shakes his head, helping me off the ice. “He's a fucking menace.”
“But you love him.”
He pulls me right back into his arms, and I sink into him.
This is where I belong.
“I love you,” he whispers against my lips.
“And I love you more…Owen.”
EPILOGUE
Smith
I've been officially retired for a few months now but looking out at the
group of people smiling at me makes it feel real for the first time.
I am done with hockey.
Well, not done done. I'm still working for the Comets. I signed on the
dotted line just a month ago and am now officially an assistant video coach
for the team I love.
It's weird, but I also can't deny the weight lifted off my shoulders. It's
freeing in a way I wasn't expecting. I miss it, but I also don't. Not the way I
expected to miss it.
That could be because I'm still involved in the game, but it could also
be because my days are full of everything I didn't realize I was missing.
Spending time with Emilia and being able to be open with our relationship
was worth giving up the game. Being with her gives me a better high than
being on the ice ever did.
Emilia's arm slips around my waist, bringing me back to the here and
now. I tug her closer, relishing the way she fits so perfectly tucked under
my arm.
“You good?” she whispers from beside me.
I peer down at the redheaded beauty grinning up at me. I know her well
enough to know that the smile she's sending my way is full of worry and
uncertainty.
Probably because all our friends are standing in front of us with a sign
that reads Happy Retirement, Old Man. I thought we were coming here for
a quiet game night. Hell, I even have a puzzle tucked under my arm right
now.
Apparently, I've been misled. This isn't a game night. This is a surprise
retirement party. Lowell's house is decorated with streamers and balloons,
and a few tables are set up with different kinds of snacks. There are
members of the coaching staff scattered around, and even Blake is here with
his husband.
Everyone stares at me with a grin, eagerly waiting for my reaction.
It's hard to give one, especially with the emotion in my throat. This is
the exact reason I didn't want to make a big deal about my retirement and
do it after the season ended. It's tough handling the emotions that come
with it internally, never mind in front of a crowd. Just standing here, I can
feel the tightness worsening and the sting of tears threatening to form.
Emilia tightens her hold on me because of course she knows why I can't
talk right now.
“Dude, can you react or something? This is getting awkward as fuck.”
“Shut up, Miller!” Rhodes yells at him, smacking the back of his head.
Everyone laughs, and the tension in the room is broken.
“Thanks, guys,” I say, blinking a few times, hoping nobody notices I'm
about two seconds away from crying. “I appreciate it.”
“Speech!” someone hollers from the back, and it sounds suspiciously
like Collin is just deepening his voice.
Emilia gives me another encouraging squeeze.
I clear my throat. “I don't have anything prepared because, clearly, this
wasn't what I thought tonight was going to be.” I shake the puzzle box as
proof.
“What kind of old man brings a puzzle to game night?” Miller says, and
it earns him another slap, this time from Lowell.
“Hockey has been my life for…well, all my life. It's been everything to
me for a long time, and spending these last few years with everyone in this
room has made me love the game even harder…and that's with having
Miller on the team.”
“Aww,” the guy in question says, placing his hand over his heart.
“Because of that, deciding to hang up my skates wasn't an easy one. It
was easily the hardest thing I ever had to decide. But…” I peek down at
Emilia, who is watching me with tears glistening in her eyes. “While I
might love the game of hockey and you guys too, there's someone else I
love more. And I'd choose her every time.”
A single tear slips down Emilia's cheek, and I wish like fuck we weren't
in a room full of people right now because I want so badly to haul her into
my arms, kiss away the tears, then strip her bare.
“Fucking hell, Emilia, if you don't kiss him after that, I will.”
Lowell groans at Miller's outburst. “Can we duct tape his mouth and
handcuff him in the spare bedroom until he promises to act right?”
“I just really want to know why you have duct tape and handcuffs on
standby,” Miller says.
“You know, as much as I hate agreeing with him, I'm curious too,”
Collin agrees.
“Got to be a kinky sex thing for sure,” Rhodes adds.
“Like you have room to talk about kinky sex things,” Ryan mutters to
her husband.
Everyone turns their attention to Rhodes, whose cheeks are growing
redder by the second. They all start talking over each other, trying to guess
each other's kinks.
I ignore them, grabbing Emilia's hand and tugging her away from their
idiocy. I sit the puzzle box on the table in the entryway and draw her into
my arms.
She grins up at me. “You surprised?”
“Very much so.”
“You're not mad, are you? I know you're not super fond of crowds, but
they really wanted to do something for you.”
“Not mad,” I assure her. “Grateful.”
“Yeah?”
“Yeah.” I nod. “And mildly annoyed that there are so many people
around because I really, really want to show you just how grateful I am.” I
press against her tighter, and there's no way she doesn't feel my growing
cock. “You think they'll notice if we sneak off for a few minutes?”
“Even if they do, I don't care.”
I grab her hand to drag her down the hall toward the bedrooms.
We don't make it two feet before the front door flies open.
“Oh my gosh!” Scout says, scurrying over the threshold with a stack of
boxes in her hand. “I am so sorry I'm late, Emilia. There was a whole thing
with traffic, and the security guard wouldn't let me in the neighborhood.
But I brought donuts!”
“Don't worry about it. We're glad you made it,” Emilia says, stepping
toward her.
She's brushed aside by Miller, who comes out of nowhere, reaching for
the boxes.
“I can take those for you,” he says to Scout, who is staring at him with
wide eyes.
“T-Thanks,” she says quietly.
“Sure thing. I'm Grady, by the way. It's nice to meet you.”
I'm about to tell Miller he's an idiot for not recognizing Scout from the
donut truck, but I don't have the chance to. Scout pulls the boxes closer to
her chest and brushes past him like he never spoke at all, clearly—and
rightfully—annoyed with him.
“What'd I say?” Miller mutters, following closely behind her.
Emilia laughs, and I shake my head at the idiot, watching as he trails
after Scout looking like someone punched him in the gut.
“He's going to have some fun digging himself out of that hole he just
created,” Emilia says.
“I don't think fun is the right word, but I can't wait to watch either way.
But first…” I grab her hand, heading for the bedrooms for the second time.
This time we make it three steps before we're stopped.
“Hey, Smith! Come tell Greer about that insane goal you scored my first
season,” Lowell shouts, waving us over.
I groan because all I really want right now is to sneak away with Emilia.
She laughs, understanding my frustration.
“Rain check on showing me how grateful you are?”
“Checks,” I growl, wrapping my arms around her and settling for a
chaste kiss. “Plural.”
“Ooh. I like the way you think, Mr. Smith.”
“Owen. I'm not one of your players anymore, you know.”
“I know, and I love it.”
“Yeah?” I kiss the tip of her nose. “Well, I love you.”
She sighs, falling against me. “And I love you, Owen.”
And I know at this moment that I'll choose her for the rest of my life.

To the Marine.
You're the only one I want to score with.
Well, most of the time.
I mean, have you seen some of the hockey players?
1
MILLER
“You're a what?!”
I wince at the level-ten volume at which he screams the words. I yank
my hat down lower and glance around to ensure we haven't drawn any
unwanted attention. Luckily, we're so far out of the way from others that I
don't think anyone heard him. This is not the kind of information I want to
spread around.
“You heard me,” I tell Greer, my teammate and the starting goalie for
the Carolina Comets.
“I'm not entirely sure I did, so let's start from the beginning.” He points
to himself. “I said I was going to town on some chick last night, and
somehow, she reached around and stuck her finger in my ass.” He stretches
his finger my way. “Then I asked if that's ever happened to you, and you
said—”
“No, I'm a virgin.”
His mouth drops open at the confirmation, and the donut he's holding
slips from between his fingers, splatting icing side first onto the table—a
shame, especially since I know the Chocolate Nutty Butter is the best donut
ever created. He's staring at me like I'm crazy, like there has to be some
miscommunication going on.
There isn't.
I'm a twenty-four-year-old professional hockey player…and a virgin.
I'm a fucking anomaly.
“I… What… I can't even comprehend this right now. How did I not
know this?”
I shrug. “It's not exactly something I advertise.”
“How?”
“Huh?”
“How?” Greer repeats.
I didn't think I'd have to explain this to him, but… “Well, it's simple—
I've never stuck my dick in a woman before. I—”
“No, you idiot. That part I understand just fine. What I mean is how?
How in the fuck have you not had sex yet? You're what, twenty-three?”
“Twenty-four.” I don't bother to remind him he was at my birthday
dinner just last month.
“Fuck, man.” He shakes his head. “How?”
I don't want to get into my reasoning because I know it sounds stupid.
I've already told him enough, so I settle for, “I don't know, man. Just never
happened.” Then I pray he lets it go.
Like, I legit close my eyes and clasp my hands together. My
grandmother would be so proud if she could see me right now. She was
always wanting me to become more religious. I think praying my friend and
teammate doesn't continue to question my lack of dicking down a woman
counts, right?
I have no idea how long passes before he finally says, “Okay, how do
we fix this?”
Slowly, I peel one eye open, then the other. “Fix what?”
“Your…” He waves his hand toward me. “Issue.”
I'm not too keen on the way he says issue. I'm a virgin—big damn deal.
There's nothing wrong with being one. I'm not embarrassed by it at all. I'm
just…frustrated—and not just sexually. I'm frustrated because I've gotten
to this point in my life and let so many things pass me by.
Prom? Never went.
Skipping school? As if I'd ever let that shit go on my record.
Girlfriends? I wasn't about to let my GPA suffer because of someone I
was dating.
I lived and breathed hockey. My days consisted of four AM practices
before school and running drills afterward until well into the night. My
weekends were games and tournaments. When it wasn't hockey season, I
was practicing for hockey season.
The game always came first because I had dreams, big ones. And they
came true.
I'm lucky, and I know that. I get to play the best game in the world in
the best league. But now that I'm here, I can't help but think maybe I gave
up just a little bit too much for these dreams.
“It's not a big deal,” I mumble, even though it feels like one, especially
when he's staring at me like I'm King Ghidorah or some other three-headed
monster.
“If you don't care about it, why'd you tell me? I wouldn't have known
otherwise.” He lifts a challenging brow, picking up the remnants of his
dropped donut and shoveling it into his mouth.
Fuck. He's got me there.
I clasp my hand around the back of my neck, trying to squeeze out the
tension that's slowly building.
Why the fuck did I tell Greer? I could have easily lied to him. Hell, I
probably should have. He's by far the biggest asshole on the team. I mean,
not that he's really an asshole. He's just honest, and some people don't like
that. His honesty doesn't bother me, though. For someone who has been
used most of their life, it's refreshing to have someone be honest.
“Is it bothering you?” he guesses when I don't answer immediately.
“Messing with your game at all?”
“Most of the time, no.”
“But it does bother you?”
I sigh. “Of course it does. I turned twenty-four a month ago, and I'm
ninety-nine percent positive I may be the oldest virgin in the entire history
of the NHL. It's hard not to think about it sometimes. I can score on the ice
all damn day, but I can't score off it? It's sad.”
“It's not sad. It's life, and sometimes life is shit.” He says it like he's
speaking from experience, and maybe he is. We only just recently started
hanging out, and I don't know much about Greer's life, but he's not exactly
easy to read. I always figure if he wants me to know something about him,
he'll tell me, so I don't pry. “We can fix this. We just need to teach you to
talk to women.”
“I know how to talk to women, fucker. I never said that was my
problem. And besides, I don't need your help.”
That damn brow of his rises again like he doesn't believe me. Shit, if I
were sitting across from me right now discussing losing my virginity at
twenty-four, I wouldn't believe me either.
“You're telling me you've never been with a woman, and I—”
“Just because I've never had sex doesn't mean I've never been with a
woman. I've been with plenty.”
All right, fine, so plenty is a significant stretch. I've fooled around some
but not much else.
“When's the last time you were with one, then?” he challenges.
“Last night.”
“Who?”
“Your mom.”
He drops his head, shaking it. “I walked right into that, huh?” He scrubs
his hand over his face. “This is going to be a lot more work than I thought.”
“Again, I don't need your help.”
“Says the virgin.”
It's not that I'm entirely hopeless with women. I can flirt. I can charm.
I've had plenty of dates over the last few years.
Sure, nothing has stuck, but that doesn't mean I need dating help. I think
it just means I need to find the right person to date, and I certainly don't
need Greer's help with that.
“What about her?” Greer lifts his chin toward someone.
I follow his line of sight to the front of the donut truck we're sitting
outside of. Inside is the truck's owner, the woman who happens to make the
best damn donuts I've ever had.
She also happens to hate me.
“Her name is Scout,” I tell him, turning back around.
“You know her, then?”
I shrug. “Sort of. She's, uh, not a big fan of mine.”
“What'd you do?”
“Why do you assume it was something I did?”
“Because I once watched you hit on a mom and her daughter. You're
not exactly smooth with the ladies.”
Fuck. I did do that.
I drag my hand back to my neck, squeezing it again because more
tension is building. I'll have to see about stopping by the team's masseuse if
this shit keeps up. I need to be loose on the ice, not all keyed up like this.
I groan. “I sort of…introduced myself to her.”
His brows slam together. “Is that a bad thing?”
“Since I come here pretty much weekly and should have known who
she was, yes.”
Even Greer winces at that, and he should. It was embarrassing as hell.
In all fairness, I'm used to seeing her from the tits up with her brown
hair tossed into a bun and an apron on. I didn't expect to see her at my
former teammate's party wearing a dress that hugged all her curves with
curled hair and the sexiest fucking smoky eyes I've ever seen.
“Yeah, okay. Maybe not her.” His eyes slide back toward the truck.
“Or…” He draws the word out. “Maybe yes her, because she's definitely
looking this way right now.”
I'm almost sure he's screwing with me, so I glance over my shoulder to
check. Before I can get a good look, Greer smacks me in the back of the
head.
“Don't look, you idiot. It'll make it obvious that we're talking about
her.”
“Ouch.” I rub the spot he hit. “Fine, I won't look.”
“I won't lie, you are missing out.”
I go to sneak a glance, and he hits me again.
“Stop hitting me, asshole.”
“Well, stop looking. Breaking your neck to get a glimpse makes you
look more desperate than you already are.”
“Fuck you. I'm not desperate.”
“You wouldn't be coming to me for help if that wasn't the case.”
“But I'm not coming to you for help. You've just inserted yourself into
this.”
“Because this can't go on any longer. You're a fucking pro hockey
player and a damn good one at that—you should be swimming in pussy.”
“Like you are with your ass-play girlfriend?”
“First of all, she's not my girlfriend.” He wrinkles his nose like the
thought is disgusting to him. “I don't do girlfriends. I'm not really the
relationship type. Tried it, wasn't for me.”
“I've never had a girlfriend.”
There I go confessing more shit to him like he's my fucking therapist or
something.
“Seriously? You're a virgin and you've never even had a girlfriend
before?”
I shake my head, hoping like hell he doesn't see the heat that's
definitely filling my cheeks right now because this shit is embarrassing to
talk about. “No. I, uh, spent a lot of time playing hockey.”
What I don't tell him is I tried to date in high school, but as soon as my
dad found out, he nixed that completely. Girls were distractions, and I
wasn't allowed to be distracted. I had to keep my eye on the prize: the
NHL.
I got drafted right after high school and wasn't in college long enough
to get wild. By then, dating and girls and everything else felt like too much
pressure, and with having to prove to the Comets that I was call-up worthy,
I was already under enough. I've certainly made up for it over the last few
years, but it's not like I'm out with a different woman every night the way
he seems to be.
“So did I, but I still made time for pussy. Tell me you've at least had
your dick sucked.”
“Why? You offering if not?” He glowers at me, and I laugh. “Yeah, I've
had my dick sucked.”
“Well, at least you've experienced that. Was it any good?”
I mean, I came, but would I say good… Eh.
Apparently, I don't have to tell him that; my face must say it all.
He chucks his third donut, which is only half eaten, back into the box.
“You're depressing me and ruining my donuts.” He glances over my
shoulder. “But not as much as she's depressing me.”
I risk the smack to my head and look this time. The heated stare Scout is
sending my way makes me scared she's about to pull a knife from behind
her back and chase me out of the parking lot with it.
I shift around on the bench because, sadly, a tiny part of me finds that
particular scenario really hot.
Shit. Maybe I am more desperate to get laid than I thought.
Scout is in her usual attire: an apron over a pair of overalls with her hair
piled high on top of her head in the same messy look. Her usually pouty lips
are rolled together, and she's standing with her arms crossed over her ample
chest. She looks just as annoyed as she was at the party.
And even more so when she realizes I'm now staring at her.
I lift my hand in a small wave, and the frown she's sporting deepens. It
takes half a second for her to turn her back on me, busying herself with
something in the truck. It's clear to anyone else watching that she's not
actually working on anything and is just ignoring me.
Guess I deserve the cold shoulder.
“Wow.” Greer whistles. “You weren't kidding. She does hate you. It
looks like you might be screwed when it comes to her, and not in the way
you're hoping to be. It's too bad, too. She's hot, maybe a little nerdy for me,
but the nerdy girls are always up for some kinky shit.” He bounces his
brows up and down, grinning. “I bet she'd forgive you if you played the
famous hockey player card.”
His words grate on every damn nerve I have because I swear he sounds
just like my father right now.
I've been the hockey player my entire life. It's all my parents ever cared
about since they realized I wasn't so bad at the game. Having me go pro
became their life, so it became my life. So much so that I gave up
everything—and I do mean everything—for it, and none of it was for the
right reasons.
I'm not telling Greer any of that shit, though. I've already said entirely
too much.
“I'm more than a hockey player.” The words come out much harsher
than I intended.
He doesn't miss it either, his eyes widening at my sudden outburst.
He lifts his hands in surrender. “Didn't say you weren't. I'm just saying
it's not a bad card to use. Works like a fucking charm for me.” He licks
remnants of his donut—Fruit & Pebbles this time—off his fingers. “Shit,
maybe I should hit her up because damn these donuts are good.”
My stomach sours at the thought of Greer and Scout together. I don't
have any business having any sort of opinion about it, but still, I don't like
it for some reason. Maybe because Scout's always seemed nice, and Greer
is a bit of a tool on a good day. Plus, it's clear all he wants women for is one
thing, and Scout doesn't deserve that.
“You shouldn't want people just for what they're good at.”
He pauses just before he takes a bite of his fourth donut, then quirks a
brow. “I'm sensing there's some unresolved shit going on with you given
the comments you've made, but I'm not going to go into it because I'm a
respectful asshole.”
“You've got the asshole part right,” I say, and he just laughs, completely
unfazed.
“That I am.” He grabs a napkin and wipes the remaining mess off his
hands. “All right, if we're done bonding for the day, I'm heading out. I need
to stop by the practice barn and check out my new helmet.” He rises,
towering over the table with a stern look. “We're not done talking about
this, though—the virgin thing, I mean. We need to get that fixed.”
“We?”
“Yup. Can't have you out on the ice in these conditions. It's clearly
eating you up. We don't need you distracted. We got a Cup to win, baby.”
He's not wrong about that.
“And that,” he says, nodding toward the truck. “Fix that.”
“Scout?”
“Yes. I'd like to enjoy my breakfast peacefully and not feel like I'm
about two seconds away from being chased off with a broom. You need to
apologize to her.”
“I've tried,” I explain. “Several times. She hides or puts up her Be Right
Back sign and then never returns. Hell, she even shoved a kid to the register
once.”
“Try again. Nobody wants to eat donuts in these conditions.”
“Fine. I'll talk to her.” I rise to my feet. “But I just have one question
before you go.”
“What's that?”
“Did you like it?”
“Huh?”
I lift one finger in the air, wiggling it around with a grin. “Did you like
it?”
His cheeks pinken, and he looks about two seconds away from leaping
over the table and swinging at me, but he can't. We're in public, and Coach
would have our asses if we got in trouble for fighting.
So instead, he flips me off, which makes me laugh even harder.
I swear I hear him call me a dick as he heads for the makeshift parking
lot.
With a sigh, I pick up our trash and head for the garbage cans up front,
readying myself for my second embarrassment of the day: apologizing to
Scout.
She can't hide from me forever, right?

SCOUT
Some things in life genuinely suck.
Having a piece of food stuck in your teeth and nobody telling you. A
bird crapping on your car as soon as you wash it for the first time in
months. Not being recognized by your crush.
That last one?
It happened to me. Just two weeks ago, actually.
Now that same guy is walking toward my food truck, and what the hell
am I doing?
Hiding.
As in I am physically ducked down and hiding because he caught me
staring at him not once but twice today. Now he's coming up here
presumably to talk, something I want no part of.
“What the hell are you doing?” Stevie asks. She's my older sister, and
today she's also my savior for bailing me out and helping in the truck this
morning when my other baker flaked on me for the second time this month.
I'm really starting to think I need different help.
Stevie stares down at me with her brows pulled tight together, her hazel
eyes narrowed in confusion as she waits for me to answer.
What am I supposed to tell her? That I'm hiding from the ridiculously
hot hockey player who's walking this way? Not going to happen. I'll sound
insane for so many reasons.
“I'm… Inventory,” I tell her.
“You're inventory?”
“Yes. Well, I'm doing inventory. We need more nutmeg.”
She crosses her arms over her chest, a smirk forming on her lips, clearly
amused by me making a complete and utter fool of myself. “Nutmeg?”
“The nuttiest of meg,” I answer.
She laughs. “Get up, you weirdo. A customer is coming. Are you…
Oh!” Realization dawns on Stevie's face, and she drops down next to me.
“Are you hiding from him?”
“Yes!” I whisper, though it comes out as more of a hiss.
“Why?” Stevie questions. “Wait—is that the guy?”
I nod reluctantly.
Stevie knows all about The Guy.
The Guy who, when I first saw him, I swore was the most beautiful man
I'd ever seen.
The Guy who, when I first talked to him, made me more tongue-tied
than I've ever been before, and I've met three of the Backstreet Boys and
Keanu Reeves, thank you very much.
The Guy who makes my heart flutter.
And The Guy who, despite coming to my donut truck almost weekly for
the last year, doesn't seem to have a single damn clue who I am.
“Is it safe to assume your crush on him is still going strong if you're
hiding?”
“No. I'm hiding because he's a jerk,” I counter. “And I do not have a
crush on him.”
It's a lie, and we both know it.
Can I be blamed, though? He's Grady Miller, star right winger for the
Carolina Comets. Not only is he incredible and charismatic on the ice, he's
also the same way off it. I can't count the number of times he's been
bombarded by rabid fans here at my truck, and he just smiles, signs all the
things, and takes countless photos with them. I've also seen him order a box
of donuts and share it with Eddie, the man who sits on the corner just up the
street, never once slinging an ounce of judgment his way.
And just because that couldn't possibly be enough, he has to go and be
the hottest man I've ever seen. If he weren't a hockey player, I have no
doubt he could be a model with his midnight black hair that's always messy
like he just rolled out of bed and a jawline so damn sharp the TSA should
consider it a weapon. And his eyes… It's as if someone poured a tumbler of
top-shelf whiskey right into them.
I shouldn't be crushing on him. He's so far out of my league that we're
not even playing the same sport.
He's an NHL player. I'm a donut maker. There's no way we would ever
make any sense together.
My little crush on him? It's a fantasy, just like what I read about in
novels. I never had any intention of doing anything about it, and now I'm
confident I never will after the incident two weeks ago where he introduced
himself to me like he doesn't stop by my donut truck regularly.
“I still can't believe he didn't recognize you,” Stevie says.
I can. I can believe it because it's what has happened to me all my life.
I'm invisible. People don't see me. They never really have.
I'm the girl in the background of every movie who is just out of the
camera's focus, watching while the popular girl gets the popular guy. I'm
not saying that to hate on myself, and I'm not saying it because I don't think
I'm attractive enough or worth getting—because I am on both counts. I'm
saying it because it's true. I play it safe and don't step out of my comfort
zone. I'm good with being safe and remaining the background or secondary
character. I'm content with my life.
But sometimes…just sometimes…I wish I weren't.
I wish I were more outgoing. Wish I weren't so damn awkward. Wish I
had the guts to do something brave, like writing the romance novel like I
promised I would and finally publishing it.
But I'm none of those things, because the idea of becoming or doing
them makes me want to vomit.
I'm just Scout: donut maker, nerd, and wannabe writer.
And I'm okay with that.
“You can't hide from him forever, you know,” Stevie tells me.
“Yes, I can.”
She chuckles lightly, brushing brown hair that almost exactly matches
mine behind her ear. “You made my nine-year-old daughter work the
register for thirty minutes when he was here the other day. I'm pretty sure
there are child labor laws against that or something.”
“It's not my fault he wouldn't go away.”
“Scout…”
“Steve,” I say, knowing she hates it when I call her that, but I hate that
she's calling me out on my childish behavior. I guess stooping to juvenile
insults isn't helping my case, but still.
“You have to talk to him sometime.”
She really has no clue how humiliating it was, though. I'd never felt like
such an outsider before. It took everything I had not to drop off the donuts
and leave because it was so damn clear to me that even though I considered
some of those people my friends, I didn't belong there.
I'm not their friend. I'm their donut maker, and they are customers.
That's it.
“You need to talk to him, and I'm not bailing you out this time.” She
pushes up to her feet, then begins untying the apron that's slung around her
waist.
“What?! Where are you going?”
“I told you…” she says, sliding the apron onto the hook near the exit.
“Macie has a dentist appointment.”
“No! Cancel it! Reschedule! I don't care—just don't leave me.”
She pulls her crossbody purse over her head, then looks at me like she
can't believe I just said that. Hell, I can't believe I just said it. It's stupid.
I'm being stupid.
“Just talk to him,” she says again, then she steps out of the back of the
truck like the traitor she is.
Here I was thinking she was here to do good, but this? It's evil. She's
evil.
“Stevie!” I whisper-shout at her back despite knowing damn well she's
not going to turn around and help me. Stevie loves tough love. I'm
surprised she's let me get away with this little game of mine as long as she
has.
I watch her walk away from my crouched position and don't miss her
sending a wave to someone standing at the front of the truck.
Does that mean…
“Are you hiding from me?”
Oh crap.
“Because you know…” he continues, tapping the countertop a few
times, “I'm tall. I can see over this thing, and I can definitely see you.”
Dammit.
“You can't avoid me forever.”
Can too.
“Even Stevie said you can't.”
With a heavy sigh, I rise, and yep, he's there all right, in all his perfect
hockey-player hotness. He's grinning at me, and it's annoying because
somehow even his teeth are perfect.
“Ah, there she is,” he says.
His voice is laced with sugary sweetness, but I'm not buying it. I've
been fooled by men with pretty faces before.
“What do you want.” It doesn't come out as a question because all the
niceties I had are gone when it comes to Miller.
He grimaces, his bravado slipping away before my eyes. He rocks back
on his heels as one hand goes to his pocket and the other comes up to his
neck. He cups it, squeezing like he's trying to relieve tension. It almost
makes me feel bad.
Almost.
“I, uh…” He clears his throat. “Well, I'd like to apologize.”
I lift a brow. “For?”
“Smith's party.”
I cross my arms over my chest. “What about Smith's party?”
He swallows thickly. “Fornotrecognizingyou.”
It comes out rushed as one word, like he's embarrassed. Which I'm glad
for because, given the number of times he has been to my truck, he should
be embarrassed.
He blows out a breath like he's relieved to get the words off his chest.
I'm glad one of us is relieved by this, but it's not me. I'm still humiliated by
what happened.
“It was very dickish of me.”
“Dickish is a good way to put it. Personally, I would have said you were
being an asshole, but dickish is fine too.”
A smirk plays at the corner of his lips, and I'm annoyed by how cute I
think it is, especially when I'm supposed to be mad at him. “I've never seen
you outside of here,” he says by way of explanation. “It was… Well, you
didn't look like you.”
“I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be offended by that.”
“Not!” he practically yells. “Not. I mean it in a good way.”
My brows pull together because… “Are you saying I look bad when
I'm here?”
“Yes.” He nods, but somewhere along the way, his movements switch
from up and down to left and right as his eyes widen to about twice their
average size. “No, no, no! That's not what I'm saying. You look great, now
and then—just different.”
“Different?” My lips twitch, perhaps because I'm enjoying watching
him trip over himself just a little too much right now.
He sighs, scrubbing a hand over his face before looking up at me with
tired eyes. “Look, I'm an idiot sometimes, okay? I do and say stupid things.
That's the only excuse I really have as to why I didn't recognize you. That
and I'm pretty sure my grandmother had glaucoma, and that shit is
hereditary. I think…I don't know. I saw a meme one time that said that, so
maybe my eyes are going bad. I swear I'll make an appointment with the
team doctor ASAP, just to be sure. I…” He takes another heavy breath. “I'm
just sorry, all right? I'm so, so sorry.”
He stares up at me with those whiskey-colored eyes that are silently
begging me to believe him.
The sad part is that it's working. I can see this is eating him up.
He has tried to talk to me several times. Maybe he means it, and maybe
he meant nothing by it. In all fairness, I did look really different that night.
Perhaps I'm stupid or weak, or maybe that silly crush of mine might not
totally be gone, but…
“Okay,” I say, letting him off the hook. “I forgive you.”
He exhales sharply, pressing his hand against his chest. “Oh, thank fuck.
Because I really want you to forgive me. I love coming here, and I'm pretty
sure I can't live without your donuts.”
“That so, huh?”
“Hell yes. I'm addicted to the—”
“Chocolate Nutty Butter. I know.”
He looks surprised. “You do?”
“Yes, because unlike you, I remember people.”
His jaw drops for a moment, shock rippling through him. Then he
chuckles, but I can hear the hurt in it. I feel just a tiny bit bad, but dammit,
he hurt my feelings too.
“I deserved that.”
“You really did,” I agree.
“Truce? No more hiding from me?”
“I wasn't hiding,” I insist. “I was doing inventory.”
“Right.” He smirks. “Inventory.”
“We need nutmeg,” I say defiantly, but it's a lie. We have plenty of
nutmeg.
Luckily, he doesn't call me out on it.
“I'm glad you finally talked to me. I'm glad we can be friends.”
I snort out a laugh. “I never said anything about being friends.”
His eyes widen again, and he takes an actual step back like I've just
knocked all the wind out of his sails. “Are you saying you don't want to be
my friend?”
“That's exactly what I'm saying.”
“Why not?”
“Well, for starters, you forgot who I am…”
He groans. “I told you, I'm—”
“An idiot. Yeah, I picked up on that. But secondly, you don't really want
to be friends with me.”
“Yes, I do.”
“No, you really don't. We have no business being friends.”
“Why not? You're friends with Lowell, aren't you? Smith too, so why
not me?”
Do I know Lowell better than the other guys? Yes, but only because we
went to high school together, and Smith is only friendly toward me because
my niece has some sort of weird attachment to him. She's obsessed with
hockey and idolizes the guy ever since he sponsored her soccer team.
“Because we're two totally different people, Miller.”
“Grady,” he says. “That's what my friends call me.”
“Yeah, that's what you said at Smith's party.” He looks sheepish again, a
tinge of red popping back up on his cheeks. “But we're not friends, so
you're just Miller the hockey player to me.”
A dark look crosses his features, and it's almost as if I've hurt his
feelings.
Then, almost as quickly as it came, it's gone, and he's grinning again.
“You're going to be my friend, Scout.”
“I'm really not.”
“You will.” His smile widens, and it even reaches his eyes this time.
“I'm going to come here every day until you agree to be friends with me,”
he promises.
The thought of having to see Miller every day has my stomach in knots
because I'm not sure if my lady bits can stand it. Hell, they're barely able to
stand it right now with the way he's grinning up at me. How is it possible
he's this attractive?
I scramble for a reason to get him to stay away.
“I don't think your coaches would like you eating donuts every day,” I
rush out.
“Probably not.” He pats his flat stomach. “But I think I can work it off.”
I'm sure he's not lying either. I've gone ice-skating a few times, and
every single lap ended with me being winded. I can't imagine the skill it
takes to handle a stick, chase a puck, and get hit by other large dudes, all
while trying not to die from exhaustion.
“What if I kick you out?”
“Then I'll sit across the street.”
Dammit. Why does he always have to have an answer for everything?
“What if I never become your friend?”
“That's not really something we'll have to worry about.”
Another grin—another zing right between my thighs.
My face starts to heat up, and I swear it just got ten degrees hotter
outside.
Goodness gracious. Get it together, Scout.
“Anyone ever tell you you're cocky, Miller?”
“Confident, not cocky.” He taps the counter a few times. “I'll be back
tomorrow, Scout.”
“Uh-huh. I'll believe it when I see it.”
He shoots me one last grin before turning on his heel and trudging to the
parking lot toward the shiny, fancy sports car he's always driving way too
fast.
I watch him the entire time. Every stride he takes, every rock he kicks…
I see it.
Which is why I don't miss him turning back my way once he reaches
his car and shooting me a wave.
And I don't miss the way my heart flutters at the little movement either.
I pray he doesn't come back…because I'm not sure how long I'll last.

MILLER
“Come on, Miller. Get those fucking legs moving. We need speed, speed,
speed!”
I clench my teeth and push my legs harder at Coach's request. I know I
can do it. I can get to where he wants me to be, but, fuck, my legs are tired
as hell.
It's always grueling getting back into the game after taking time off. Not
that I actually take time off, but when it's not hockey season, my time on
the ice is significantly reduced, and right now, I'm feeling it everywhere.
My thighs, my ass, my lower back—all of it is aching.
But I need to push because we have a lot riding on this season after our
first-round exit last year. We need to prove to everyone that we aren't just a
one-Cup-and-done team. We need to prove we can do it and are here to stay
at the top of this league.
“That's it! Tape to tape, boys,” Coach hollers when I smack the puck to
Lowell and it lands on his stick effortlessly. We're in sync, which is a good
damn start for our first day back at it.
Lowell takes the puck to the net, trying to get Greer to bite on it. He
does, and that's when Lowell sends the puck my way, then I shoot it straight
to the back of the net.
Lowell skates over to me with his glove out, and I bump mine against
his. “Nice fucking play, kid. A perfect read.”
It was, especially considering we didn't practice this at all. While I'm
damn proud of what we just did, I'm a little worried about Greer biting on
the fake-out. Those are the small things that can really blow a game for us.
Greer doesn't look happy about it, but in typical fashion, he doesn't let
it show beyond the glower on his face. Even under pressure and when he
fucks up, he takes it in stride and keeps pushing. That's what keeps my hope
up that just maybe we'll be okay.
“From the top!” Coach yells, and we all take our positions again.
We run the play once more. This time, Greer's ready for it, and he beats
us glove side.
The next line hits the ice, and we take our places on the bench.
“Fuck, my legs are killing me,” Rhodes, our biggest and meanest
defenseman, comments as he gulps in breath after breath.
“Dude, you're telling me. This shit is exhausting. Remind me again why
we do this?” says Wright, another defenseman and Rhodes' partner.
“Because we love the hurt,” Lowell answers. “And money.”
They all grin, because our captain's not wrong. That's exactly why we
do it.
I still remember the first time I stepped onto the ice. Well, step is a nice
way of putting it. I fell, like immediately went down on my ass. It hurt, but
the embarrassment that crossed my father's face hurt more. So, I didn't say
shit. I just got up and tried again. I went down so many times that day, but I
never gave up. Instead, I asked to go back again sometime. My dad liked
my determination and took me. This time there were some older kids
playing hockey. They invited me over and handed me a stick. Even though
I'd never played or even watched a game before, I went all in. I loved every
damn minute of it.
It took me a bit to get used to it, but once I was in, I was all the way in.
And I wasn't bad at it either.
When we wrapped up the game, one of the other dads said to mine, “I
don't say this lightly: that kid has potential—big potential. I'd get him on
the right path if I were you.”
That's how it all started. Afterward, hockey became everything to me,
and the bragging rights and money that came with making it pro became
everything to my family.
Even knowing now that all I am is a pawn to them, I wouldn't trade it,
because I really do love the game that much.
“How the hell are you even out here kicking so much ass with a baby at
home?” Wright says to Lowell.
“Because my baby momma is a fucking rockstar and is killing it.” He
grins, looking so damn proud of his girlfriend, Hollis. “And because my
daughter is an angel.”
Rhodes huffs. “I beg to differ.”
“You're only saying that because she spit up on you twice,” Lowell
says. “If you'd stop scowling at her, maybe she'd like you more.”
“I don't scowl at her,” the man in question argues…while scowling.
“You do too, but you can't really help it. It's just your default setting,”
Wright tells him. He shakes his head. “I still have no idea how you and
Ryan got together. She's like the polar opposite of you.”
Just the mention of Rhodes' wife has his infamous scowl turning into a
grin. He's so smitten with her. But it really is just like Wright says—they're
opposites in every way. She's the Beauty to his Beast, and it works for
them.
“Unlike you and Harper,” Lowell says to Wright. “You're basically the
same weird horror-obsessed people.”
“Hey, she's way more into it than I am. You won't believe her latest
request and what she wants me to do with that Michael Myers mask.
She—”
Lowell holds his hand up to stop him. “Nope. Don't want to hear about
anything you do with Hollis' sister. That's my daughter's aunt. I'm good.”
“Yeah, but you used to love hearing about all our weird shit before you
got with her sister.”
“And now I don't. It's just…weird. You're too much like family.”
“Did you just call me your brother?”
Lowell scowls at the idea, and I laugh, which draws some attention my
way.
“What about you, Miller? We all got taken down by love. When's it
your turn?”
I try not to react or slink back in my seat. I'm still trying to forget that
conversation with Greer yesterday about the sad state of my love life.
Wright nods toward Smith, who is staring intently at what's happening
on the ice. “Even the old grump found someone.”
“Yeah, someone he definitely wasn't supposed to be looking for,”
Lowell mutters.
“Can you imagine what it's like sitting around that dinner table? With
your former coach turned colleague, who also happens to be your
girlfriend's uncle?” Rhodes shakes his head. “I can't even imagine that
dynamic.”
“Like you're one to talk, Beast. Now you have to explain to your future
children that you drunk-wed their mother in Vegas.”
“Well, technically…” Rhodes starts, but Wright waves him off.
“Technically my ass. At least Harper and I have a normal story to tell
our nieces and nephews.”
“First of all, there was nothing normal about how you and Harper met,”
Lowell says. “Secondly, are you and Harper still in the No Kids camp?”
“Yep,” he answers proudly. “We're good being the fun aunt and uncle.
Which reminds me—we bought baby Freddie this adorable little glove with
knife hands.”
Lowell huffs. “She's named after Freddie Mercury, not Freddy Krueger,
you weirdo.”
“Semantics.”
Not that I'd admit it out loud or anything because the guys would roast
me until the end of time, but I kind of love watching them talk about their
women. It's refreshing. My dad never talked about my mom the way these
guys talk about their ladies. He'd always roll his eyes or have something
shitty to say about her, and then degrade her in some way. She'd take it out
on me, of course, but that's a whole other box of shit I'm not ready to deal
with right now.
And I wouldn't dare say this either, but I think a big part of why I
haven't been able to just lose my virginity to any random woman is because
after watching these guys fall in love one by one, I don't want her to be
random.
I want what they all have.
“On the ice, fellas!” Smith calls out, interrupting us.
It's still so weird to see him behind the bench, especially when we were
just out here playing with him a few months ago. I know he's going to be
missed this season. Whoever is coming into his position has some big
skates to fill.
We pile back over the boards and take our positions at center ice. We
run through a few more drills, working on some plays but mostly just
getting a feel for being back on the ice and together again.
It's exhausting, but it's fun. It feels damn good to be out here playing
the game I love so much with the guys I've grown to consider family. I
don't have any brothers, so this is the closest I'll ever get to having them.
We wrap up practice for the day, then hit the weights for a quick thirtyminute workout. After that, we gather in the meeting room to go over all the
not-so-fun stuff we need to get done this season. I really thought hockey
was just going to be about playing the game, but there's so much more that
goes into it.
“And that brings us to our annual start-of-the-season fundraiser. As
usual, all proceeds will go toward Kid Comets. We'd like to beat the total
we donated last year by at least ten thousand. The black-tie charity event is
in three weeks, and everyone is required to attend. Plus-ones are not
mandatory, but it is encouraged since we need those donations. So bring
your dates and bring your checkbooks, boys.” Coach stacks his papers
together and closes the cover of his notebook. “Practice is at eight sharp
tomorrow. If you need anything else, you know where to find me.”
With that, he heads for the door, leaving us to ourselves for the day.
“You going to bring a date?” Greer asks, popping up beside me. “If you
can get one, I mean.”
I glare at him. “I can get one.”
“That's not what your track record says.”
I glance around, making sure nobody is paying any attention to us.
“Shut up.”
“Why? Afraid they'll learn you're not the ladies' man you claim to be?”
All right, fine. So maybe all the guys on the team think I date around
more than I let on. And I guess I do go on a lot of dates with a lot of girls I
never call back. When the guys ask about it, I always give them a cocky
grin and say I never kiss and tell.
But the truth is, there's never anything to tell because nothing usually
happens on those dates.
Greer laughs, clapping me on the shoulder and steering me out of the
room. “I'm just screwing with you, man. I'd never say anything about…
your thing.”
For some reason, I believe him. Greer may be an asshole and he may
love fucking with me, but I also trust him.
“I think we're going to hit up Slapshots. Guess it's tradition or
something. Want to come?”
Going to the hockey-themed bar downtown is a team ritual, but today I
have something I have to do first.
“I'll meet you guys there later.” For a moment, I contemplate telling
Greer where I'm headed, but I don't want to field the million and one
questions he's going to have, especially after yesterday.
“Sure, man. No problem. Text me when you're on your way.”
I nod, then head in the opposite direction. In the parking garage, I climb
into my gray Porsche 911 Turbo S, firing it up and relishing the way she
purrs to life under me. I've never been a big car guy, but the moment I saw
this beauty, I knew I had to have her. Besides, me spending the money on
myself really pissed my dad off, which made me love the car ten times
more.
I send the gate guard a wave as I squeal out of the garage and head
toward my destination. Less than ten minutes later, I'm pulling into the
makeshift parking lot and throwing the car into park.
I grab my trusty Comets baseball cap and tug it down over my head
before hopping out of the car. The place is empty for the moment, but I'm
sure people are going to start showing up any time now for their midday
pick-me-up.
I head straight for the person I came here to see, and the moment she
spots me, she lets out a long, exaggerated sigh and lifts her eyes skyward.
I think I'm supposed to be offended by how unhappy she is to see me,
but I can't be, not when I know Scout doesn't really hate me. She wants to
be my friend, and I want to be hers. Outside of my teammates, I don't really
know anyone else here, and it would be nice to talk to someone about
something other than hockey sometimes. Hell, even all the girls I've tried
dating are only interested in one thing—the game. For once, I want to talk
to someone who doesn't just see me as a hockey player. I want them to just
see me, and based on the way she doesn't seem to give a flying fuck about
who I am, Scout just might be that person I'm looking for.
I laugh, then send her a wave. “Heya, friend. How's your day?”
She gives me a pointed glare. “Still not friends, Miller.”
“Sure we are, and as your friend, I'm here to support your small local
business. Can I please get a black coffee with—”
“One packet of sugar and a shake of cinnamon.”
“How did you—”
“Know?” She lifts her brows. “I remembered.”
The corner of her lips twitch like she wants to laugh at her own joke,
and part of me is dying to see it. In fact, I kind of want to see her really
laugh, like throw her head back and just let it all out.
She punches my order into the tablet, then swings it around for me to
pay. I make sure to tack on a twenty-dollar tip for the three-dollar coffee.
When she turns it back around, her eyes narrow on the screen for just a
moment, but she doesn't say anything. Instead, she tucks her lips together
and spins around to grab my drink.
“Busy today?” I ask her, flipping my hat around and leaning my arms
against the truck.
I'm used to food trucks sitting high up off the ground, but she's lowered
this one just a bit. I wonder if she did it to make it less intimidating for
customers and kids.
“Yep.”
That's all she says, but at least it's an answer, which is a hell of a lot
more than I've gotten out of her in the last two weeks.
She turns around with my coffee in hand, securing my lid on the top
before sliding it over to me. Then, she does what she usually does: ignores
me.
She starts rearranging things, moving bowls around and stacking trays. I
stand and watch the entire time, not saying a word.
As the seconds progress into minutes, her movements become more and
more relaxed, like she's growing used to me standing there. I'm not sure if I
should be flattered that she's feeling comfortable in my presence or
offended that she's so easily able to pretend I don't exist.
A good five minutes pass before I start getting antsy and just have to say
something to her.
“Got any plans for the rest of the day?”
She pauses, then peeks up at me.
Okay, she didn't jump, so maybe she didn't forget I was standing there.
“You're still here? I forgot all about you.”
Ouch.
“Really? I thought you had such a good memory, though,” I say, taking
a sip of my coffee. It's scalding hot and tastes like someone bottled sadness
and served it over hot coals. She must not miss my wince, because she
holds her hand out for it. “What?”
“Your coffee. Hand it over.”
I heed her command and slip the cup into her hand. She sets it to the
side, then grabs one of the clear cups I've seen her use for iced coffees and
grabs a pitcher from the fridge. She fills it about three-quarters of the way
up, then dumps some ice into it before emptying one packet of sugar and
adding a splash of milk to the mix. She caps the drink, gives it a shake, and
hands it my way with a straw.
“Here. Try this.”
Eying the cup with skepticism, I pull the straw from the wrapper and
stick it into the lid, then take a small sip. And it's good—so much better
than the hot coffee I've been drinking every time I come here.
“I notice you make a face every time you take a sip of your coffee.” She
shrugs. “I'm guessing you don't like hot coffee and cold brew might be
more to your liking. The milk helps cut down on the bitterness that can
occur.”
I'm surprised. Coffee has never been my favorite thing to drink, but it
gets the job done, so I always suffer through it. I've tried to doctor it up
with the sugar and cinnamon, but it's never good. This may just be a gamechanger for me.
“I take it you like it?” she asks after I've taken my second drink.
I nod. “It's good. No offense to whatever that other stuff was, but it's
not for me.”
“No offense taken. Not everyone likes hot coffee. I think it tastes like
burnt water, but that's just me. Give me a vanilla cold brew any day of the
week.”
This is the most Scout's ever talked to me and certainly the most she's
ever revealed about herself, though I'm not about to point that out because
I'm terrified she'll stop talking to me again.
“Can I try the vanilla tomorrow?”
Just like that, her scowl slides back into place. “I thought you were
joking about coming here and bothering me every day.”
“Am I bothering you?”
She doesn't answer immediately like I expect her to. Instead, she chews
on her bottom lip for a minute, contemplating that, likely wondering how
honest she should be right now, eventually settling on a quiet, “No. You're
not bothering me.”
I grin, and her scowl deepens, causing me to laugh.
“Okay, now you're bothering me. Go away. I have to get ready for the
lunch rush.”
As she says this, two cars pull into the parking lot, and I know from
experience that this place is about to be loaded with people looking for their
midday caffeine fix and sugar high to get them through.
I shake my cup at her. “Thanks for this.”
She nods but doesn't say anything else.
“I'll see you tomorrow, friend.”
She grunts, and I laugh again.
“I'm going to wear you down, Scout. You're going to love me.”
She scoffs and mutters something that sounds a lot like, “In your
dreams, Miller.”
I can't seem to wipe the smile off my face as I walk away.

SCOUT
“Can I get a vanilla cold brew, please?” a voice says to my back.
I don't have to turn around to know it's Miller standing there. I can tell
not only by his voice, which is so deep I swear he could narrate audiobooks,
but by how my body seems to know when he's around.
I couldn't stop thinking about him after he left yesterday. Not even the
lunch rush could distract me. All I could focus on was that he wasn't lying
about returning. He showed up just like he said he would. Given that I
thought this was all just a little game to him, it was surprising.
But today? Seeing him here yet again? That's even more of a shock.
I spin around to find him grinning at me with that same stupid smile
he's always wearing and his whiskey eyes sparkling against the midday sun.
This is about the same time he showed up here yesterday, and I wonder
if he's just getting out of practice. I know hockey season is right around the
corner because my niece won't stop talking about it and how the Comets
have a much better chance of not Toronto-ing this year, whatever the hell
that means.
“Please?” he asks, and this time he actually bats his lashes at me…
lashes that are thick and dark and frame his eyes perfectly.
For the first time in a long time, my fingers itch for a keyboard, because
this right here is that moment in all novels where the guy walks up to the
lonely, awkward girl and gives her that grin that makes her knees weak. I
want to write a story about that grin.
Ugh, Scout! Stop thinking about how attractive he is. It's still the same
guy who forgot who you were. He's just like everyone else.
I don't answer him. Instead, I ring up his coffee, then spin the tablet his
way and get started on his drink. A slight sense of pride swells in my chest
as I pour the cold brew and add a bit of vanilla syrup. I've been running this
truck for a few years and have gotten good at reading customers. It didn't
take me any time to realize Miller hates hot coffee. I wanted to say
something about it to him before, but I've always been too nervous to
approach him. Now, though, not so much.
He still makes me nervous, and my heart still feels like it wants to burst
out of my chest, but he seems a little less scary than before.
I slide his coffee and straw across the counter, then flip the tablet back
around. I can't help but frown at the number I see on the screen.
He tipped me big again.
I know I shouldn't be annoyed because hello, money! But still. It's like
he's trying too hard to make up for forgetting me, which makes him
showing up and bothering me feel like a show. A gimmick, like it's not
genuine.
“You don't have to keep tipping me so big, you know. I already said I
forgive you. No need to bribe me.”
His lips pull down at the corners. “I'm not bribing you. I'm just grateful
to now be drinking something I enjoy. Besides, I tip everyone big.”
“Well, thanks,” I murmur, a little annoyed at how flippantly he says
that. I should have expected it, though. He's a famous hockey player; this is
nothing to him.
“Thank you.” He shakes his drink around, then takes another sip. “I
really like the vanilla in this.”
His compliment perks me up because I love when customers enjoy the
things I make, especially the ones I work so hard on. “It's good, right? I
made it.”
“You made it?”
“Why are you surprised by that?”
“I…I don't know. I just figured it was bottled or something.”
I shake my head. “Nope. Everything here is made fresh. Well, almost
everything—I buy the sprinkles in bulk.”
“Speaking of supplies…” He reaches into his back pocket and produces
a little shaker of something. He sets it on the counter, then slides it my way.
“For inventory.”
I pick up the bottle of spice and can't help but laugh when I see what's
on the label.
Nutmeg.
Just above it, he's scrawled Scout's.
“You got me my own nutmeg?”
He lifts a shoulder. “I heard you were running low. Didn't want you to
run out. God forbid there's not enough for your Aww Nuts(meg) donut.”
I grin, staring down at the bottle that I just know I'm never going to
open. “Thanks. I'm sure my customers will appreciate it.”
“Maybe I'm not so bad to have around, then, huh, friend?”
I roll my eyes. “No, you definitely are. Now, shoo. I apparently have
some inventory to do before the lunch rush starts.” I shake the bottle.
“Thanks again for this,” he says, lifting his coffee before spinning on his
heel.
“You're welcome,” I mutter quietly to his retreating back.
I don't know how long I stand there and watch him walk away, but it's
long enough for him to catch me staring and wink at me.
I scowl, and he laughs.
Then, I get to work.
“You have to fire her, Scout,” Stevie says as she ties her hair up in a
ponytail. “This is getting ridiculous. You can't keep covering for her. You're
going to burn yourself out, then you'll never have time to get your book
finished.”
I let out a frustrated sigh as Stevie gives me the same speech she's been
giving me for the last month.
She's right, but I don't want her to be right because that would mean I
have to go through applications and all the hard work of finding another
baker. I don't want to do that again, but I also don't want to spend every
waking hour inside this truck. I love it, but I also love sliding into my
bathtub with a bottle of wine and a good book on an off day, something I
haven't had in far too long.
“I know, I know,” I tell her as she wraps her apron around her waist and
brushes past me, her lips set in a firm line. “It's just her dad is sick, and,
well, I get it.”
Stevie sends me a look as she passes by, a bowl of freshly made
strawberry icing in hand. “That's bullshit, and you know it. Carla knows it
too. Her dad had the flu. He's fine now. He's been fine. She's just taking
advantage of you because she knows your history and because you're
entirely too nice.”
A part of me wants to believe Carla is a good person and she's not
taking advantage of me, but I know Stevie is right. She is using my past
against me and playing the sick dad card when I know for a fact he's fine. I
saw him at the drugstore two days ago. He was in the hygiene aisle. I was
grabbing tampons, and he was getting condoms. It's safe to say Carla's dad
is hunky-dory.
“Did I just hear you say Scout is nice?” My skin instantly buzzes at the
sound of Miller's voice. “Because if so, why has she never shown that side
of herself to me?”
I turn around to find the hockey player who just won't go away standing
at the front of the truck with a playful sparkle in his eyes. He's been here
every day for the last week, and I'm really starting to wonder when he's
going to get tired of this game and finally leave me alone.
Right now, it doesn't look like it'll be anytime soon.
Stevie tilts her head at me, likely waiting for me to run away or duck
down and hide. When I don't, her brows rise in a way that says we'll
definitely be discussing this later.
I really don't want to discuss it later.
In fact, I was really hoping Miller wouldn't even show today.
But, of course, he did.
And now he and my sister are looking at me expectantly.
With a sigh, I wave a hand toward him. “Miller, meet my older sister,
Stevie. Stevie, this is Miller. He plays—”
“Right wing. He had 90 points last year and was ranked one of the top
eight forwards in the league by SportsCenter.” She wipes her hand on her
apron, then extends it his way. “I know who you are, Mr. Miller. My
daughter won't stop talking about the Comets. She's a huge fan.”
Miller grins, then slides his hand against hers. “Grady is fine. And I love
hearing that. It's always nice to meet a fan.”
Oh, he has his charm turned all the way up today. I can tell by the way
he's smiling at her and puffing his chest out just a bit.
“I'm not a fan. My daughter is.”
I can't help but laugh when Stevie kills his ego with a few simple
words.
“I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Comets fan, but Beast is my
favorite player by far.”
“That grump?” Miller scoffs. “I'm way better than Rhodes.”
“Keep telling yourself that,” Stevie tells him. “So, did you finally
apologize to my sister for being an ass?”
Miller's gaze snaps to mine, and my whole system goes into shock
because there's no way she actually just said that, knowing full well that it
implies…
“You've been talking about me?” Miller says with a cocky smile. “I
knew you liked me, Scout.”
I roll my eyes. “I liked you better when you didn't know who I was.”
He just laughs as I turn to make his coffee for him. I contemplate
screwing it up to get back at him for embarrassing me just now, but I can't
bring myself to mess with a customer's order—no matter how annoying
they are.
When I slide the finished drink his way, he's still grinning, and when I
see the total on the screen, I know why. He left me another twenty-dollar
tip. It makes me want to reach across the counter and wipe the smug smirk
from his face.
“Stop it,” I grumble, and all he does is laugh.
“Don't worry, I won't tease you about it too much. I knew all along
there was no way you could actually hate me. I'm impossible to hate.”
“I don't think that's the case at all.”
“Pretty sure it is,” he argues, taking a drink of his coffee. “Ah, just the
way I like it. Only a friend would remember that.”
Stevie points from me to Miller. “You two are friends now?”
“No.” Miller shakes his head. “Can you believe your sister won't be
friends with me?”
“With as charming as you are, I'm shocked,” she quips.
“Right?” Miller says, not knowing Stevie well enough to understand
she's definitely making fun of him right now. “She doesn't know what she's
missing—I'm a great friend.”
Stevie looks up from the concoction she's currently working on,
quirking a brow at me. There are a million questions she's asking me in that
single movement. I shake my head as subtly as I can, telling her we'll
discuss it later…if she can find me, that is. I have big plans to run and hide
and avoid her forever because I do not want to get in to whatever it is Miller
is doing since I'm not sure how I feel about it yet. He's shown up every day,
and I really don't know what that means or what I want it to mean.
“What's that you're making?” Miller asks, nodding toward the bowl of
vanilla frosting I'm currently folding quins sprinkles into.
“It's filling.”
“A new donut?”
“Sort of. It was here in June, but I decided to keep it as a full-time item,
and I'll be adding it starting tomorrow. We're doing a little promo thing for
it.”
“What is it?”
“It's a Pride donut. We're calling it Live Out Proud.”
“Sweet. Literally.” He looks mighty proud of himself for the pun.
“It's for our dads,” Stevie tells him. “Scout always wanted to make a
donut that celebrated their love, and she finally perfected it this summer, so
now it's going to be a regular menu item.”
“That's awesome. I bet they're ridiculously proud of you. Are they
hockey fans? If so, I'll gladly bring some jerseys or pucks next time I stop
by.”
Stevie's gaze catches mine for only a moment before she says, “Oh,
well, Dad wasn't always but is now. Pops, on the other hand—”
“I think your phone is buzzing,” I cut her off.
I feel bad because her phone didn't really buzz, but just like I knew it
would, it draws her attention and sends her rushing toward the other end of
the truck where she keeps her purse just in case it has something to do with
Macie.
Miller tips his head, watching me expectantly like I'm going to finish
where Stevie left off, but I'm not. I don't want her spilling our personal
details to him, so I'm not about to either, especially when I'm still not sure
what his endgame is here.
I ignore him and continue mixing the sprinkles and the frosting. I'm
sure it's plenty combined by now, but I don't want to not have anything to
do with my hands, not with him standing there with that damn cold brew
and those damn watchful eyes.
“Oh, I'm all good. It wasn't mine,” Stevie says, pocketing her phone
and coming back to the front. “Maybe it was yours? It could be Carla ready
to come and actually do her job for once.”
“Who's Carla?” Miller asks.
“My other baker,” I answer, and Stevie huffs. I shoot her a glare, though
she doesn't see it because she's back to working on her own project. “She
called in today.”
“And every other day she was scheduled this week for absolutely no
reason.”
Another glare Stevie's way.
Miller's face goes from carefree to cloudy in a split second, like he's the
one angry about Carla not showing up. “That's bullshit, Scout. You
shouldn't let her use you like that. Hell, you shouldn't let anyone use you.
You're worth more than that. You should talk with her, lay down the ground
rules. And if she gives you shit, fire her. You'll find someone better—
someone who values your time and your business the way you do. That's
what you deserve.”
His tone…the way he sounds like he's talking from experience…it has a
lump forming in my throat because I was not expecting that. I'm used to
lectures from Stevie, but this? This felt different.
I find myself nodding and saying, “Okay.” Mostly because I'm not
entirely sure how I'm supposed to respond. “I'll talk to her.”
“Good.” He nods, seemingly satisfied with my answer. He lifts his
drink. “Thank you for the coffee.” He looks to Stevie. “It was great to
officially meet you. Let me know if your dads ever want anything. I'm
happy to bring it by.”
“I will,” Stevie promises, a sad smile on her face that Miller definitely
doesn't pick up on. “Nice meeting you, Grady.”
He turns his attention to me, and I swear my body hums from the way
his eyes bore into mine. “I'll see you soon, friend.”
“Goodbye, Miller.” This time, the eye roll I give him comes a little more
reluctantly, but it doesn't bother him either way. He just sends me that same
charming smile before heading for his car, and I watch him walk away yet
again.
Stevie watches too, only it's not him she's looking at. It's me.
Her stare is burning a hole in the side of my head. I can practically hear
the hundreds of questions she's hurling my way without saying a word.
Unable to take it anymore, I finally say, “Just say whatever it is you're
going to say.”
“I was just going to say that I like him. He seems nice.”
I huff out a laugh, dragging my eyes away from Miller as he climbs into
his fancy-pants sports car that probably costs more than I make in a year.
“Don't forget that he forgot who I was just three weeks ago.”
“I didn't forget, but he seems determined to make up for it.”
“He's trying too hard.”
“Or…” She stretches the word out. “He's just a really nice person who
made a mistake, and we shouldn't judge him. You're willing to give Carla
all the room in the world to make mistake after mistake, but not Grady?
Why is that?”
Because Carla can't hurt me like Miller can.
I don't say it out loud. I don't have to. Stevie knows my reasons for
keeping Miller at arm's length.
“He could be good for you, Scout. He could get you out of this truck
and out of the apartment. He could be a good inspiration for the novel you
still haven't finished.”
Or started. But I don't tell her that.
The last time I touched the book I promised I'd write was three years
ago, and that was to delete it. Every time I've sat down to write since then,
the words won't come, which really sucks for someone who wants so badly
to be published.
I know the reason I can't write. I know the reason my mind is all
blocked. I'm lacking inspiration, lacking excitement.
I need both badly.
I'm just not so sure I'm ready, especially if it means that inspiration and
excitement come in the form of Grady Miller.
He's a hotshot hockey player, and I'm not sure I want to play his game.

MILLER
“Did you get my texts last night?”
I look up to find Greer standing over me while I'm holding a hundred
and twenty-five pounds over my head. “I did.”
“And?” he presses, eyebrow raised.
At nearly midnight, my phone started blowing up with photos from
Greer. They were all of women he thought I could get to be my date for the
fundraiser. They were hot, I'll give him that, but blind dates—especially
from Greer—aren't really my thing. If I'm going to be stuck at this damn
function all night, I want to be stuck with someone I'm actually going to
enjoy spending time with. Besides, I'm not in a huge rush. I still have time
to find a date.
“And no,” I tell him, shoving the weights back up and setting the bar on
the rack. I sit up, sucking in a much-needed breath of air. I reach for the
towel that's on the bench next to me and wipe my face down. “I appreciate
the thought, but I'm like ninety percent sure I saw you making out with one
of them at Slapshots last month, and I'm not really into dating my
teammate's seconds.”
“Your loss.” Greer shrugs. “She's a great kisser.”
“Duly noted.”
“And I know she'd take care of your…issue for you.”
I know exactly what he's referring to: my virginity.
“I'm good,” I tell him, trying not to get irritated. “And I thought we
talked about how I don't want or need your help.”
He shrugs, then taps my shoulder, wanting my spot. I get up and move
to the front of the bench to spot him as he picks the bar up and lifts it off the
rack. He shoves the bar up easily, going slow and doing measured reps.
“I have a few other options lined up if you need 'em.” He presses the
weight away from his chest again. “And if all else fails, you can always
take your mom. I know the new rookie is doing that.”
I inwardly groan at the idea of going to any sort of public event with my
mother. Sure, my dad was hardest on me growing up when it came to
hockey, but my mother was tough on me in other areas. Her favorite thing
to do was chastise me for the smallest of mistakes any time we left the
house. My shoes were too scuffed or my shirt wasn't tucked in correctly or
my hair was out of place. It wouldn't matter if I spent an hour getting ready
for dinner out at the local Dairy Queen—it was never enough.
I couldn't even begin to imagine what it would be like to take her to the
fundraiser.
“I'd rather ask Wright's mother-in-law.”
“Hey! Leave her out of this, Miller! Swear to God, I will chop your dick
off if I catch you flirting with her again!” Wright shouts from a few rows
down as he pedals hard on the stationary bike.
I laugh, truly enjoying fucking with him. Don't get me wrong, his
mother-in-law is gorgeous, and I love flirting with her because it makes her
feel good, but it's all in good fun. Truth is, I just like spending time around
her because she's the kind of mother I wish I had—warm, thoughtful, and
kind.
“There's always Ryan's grandma,” Lowell offers up. “You know Grams
will take you up on that offer. I'm pretty sure she's still swooning over your
moves at Wright's wedding.”
Rhodes is grumbling and throwing warning glances my way before
Lowell even gets his whole sentence out.
Okay, so maybe I don't have the best track record when it comes to
flirting with the older women in my teammates' lives. What can I say? It's
fun to mess with them. They make it entirely too easy.
“I'll keep her in mind,” I say just to fuck with Rhodes, who smashes the
off button on his treadmill, then marches out of the room in a grumpy huff.
Greer laughs as he sets the bar back on the rack and sits up. “You're just
asking to get your ass handed to you out on the ice. You know that, right?”
I shrug. “Eh. I can take him.”
“You can take Beast? Even I wouldn't fuck with him.”
I lean down and not-so-quietly say, “Don't let him fool you. He's just a
big ol' softy underneath all that hard exterior.”
“I heard you, you little shit!” Rhodes yells from the adjoining room.
“I'll fucking show you softy,” he mutters, and I'd bet my left nut he's
scowling like crazy right now.
I laugh, then move over to the stationary bike next to Wright.
“You having trouble finding a date for the fundraiser? Mr. Casanova
himself? Dry spell?”
Ha. If he only knew.
“Something like that,” I say just to get him off my back.
Wright chuckles. “I'd offer one of Harper's friends, but, well, she's a
complete introvert, and her only friend is Ryan. I don't think Rhodes would
take too kindly to that.”
“Come near her and die,” Rhodes threatens, walking by and making
sure to hit me with his bag.
I laugh as he makes his way out of the training room, flipping everyone
off behind his back, likely running right back home to his wife and locking
her away in his big dark castle so no one else can come near her.
I'd think it was sweet if I wasn't so damn jealous of him.
“Well, you better get out of whatever rut you're in because I'm pretty
sure Coach will have our asses if anyone shows up dateless. Then we'd
have to worry about Smith, too, because this is his passion project he's
heading this year.”
“I know, I know,” I grumble. “I've got it taken care of.”
Except I don't have it taken care of, not even a little bit.
I am so screwed.
Something is wrong.
It's the first thought that runs through my head when I pull into the
parking lot of Scout's Sweets. The line is snaked through the tables, so long
it almost touches said lot, which is overflowing. All eight tables are
decorated with bundles of balloons and completely full of customers.
There's music playing over a few speakers that are set up where there's
typically a little library for browsing.
There are a few patrons who appear annoyed, but for the most part,
people are smiling, which I suppose is a good thing. Still, this line isn't
normal. There has to be a reason it's backed up so much.
I grab my ballcap and tug it low over my head, then make my way
toward the front of the truck. A few people throw me curious glances, but
nobody says anything, and I'm glad because I am clearly skipping the line.
When I get about twenty feet away, I see what the problem is: Scout is
alone, and she's struggling to keep up with the line.
Her hair, which is usually a bit of a mess anyway, is even more chaotic.
Her apron is covered in what I assume is flour. There's a streak of it on her
cheek. Her eyes are wide yet tired somehow, but even though she's having
trouble, she's wearing a smile and greeting customers like a champ.
I'm not surprised when her gaze finds me standing off to the side.
Fuck. She looks worse than I thought, like she's barely hanging on by a
thread, and I hate it so much. Her eyes begin to glisten, and it seems like
she's only a few moments away from breaking down completely.
She shakes her head and mouths, Go.
I don't.
In fact, I walk closer. I don't stop until I'm waltzing into the truck like I
own the place. I grab the other apron hanging on the hook and slide it over
my head. Then, I spin my cap around and look at her.
“Put me to work.”
“Miller, I don't have time for this today. I have—”
“Put. Me. To. Work,” I repeat.
Her eyes widen at the sternness in my voice, but to my surprise, she
doesn't argue. Instead, she reaches out and grabs a fistful of my shirt,
yanking me closer to her. She pulls me in front of the register and points at
it.
“You take orders, I'll fill them. If they order a simple coffee, make it.
Leave the complex ones to me. Make sure to hand them a straw if they
order an iced coffee.”
“I got this,” I promise, even though I have no clue at all how to work
any of the machines. “Go.” I wave her off, then shoot a big smile at the
customer standing in front of me. “Welcome to Scout's Sweets, the best
damn donuts in the city. What can I get for you today?”
I swear I see her shoulders sag in relief in my periphery, but I refuse to
look at her.
“Hey, can I get a half dozen Live Out Proud donuts?”
Oh crap, that's right—she's debuting her new donut. No wonder this
place is packed.
“Sure thing,” I say, searching for the donut on the tablet and trying to
figure out how to ring up a half dozen. “Just one second…” I mutter.
“Take your time, man,” the guy says. “None of us mind waiting. We're
all here to celebrate Scout for being so damn amazing. We can wait a few
minutes, right, everyone?” he says loudly, addressing the crowd.
Multiple people throw their arms up and whoop loudly, cheering Scout
on.
I love it for her, and I'm a little mad at myself for not seeing how
amazing she is before.
“She's thankful you all showed up today. Should have seen her gushing
about these donuts yesterday,” I tell him, finally finding the button on the
screen. I swing the machine over his way like I've seen Scout do so many
times before. “They're for her dads, which I think is pretty cool.”
He smiles up at me, pays, then steps off to the side to wait.
“Next!” I call out.
And that's how the next several hours go. The line is crazy and seems
never-ending, but when three o'clock rolls around, it finally dwindles until
we only have a handful of customers left, and I've never been happier. I've
had to sit through many autograph lines in my career, but never anything
like this. I don't know how Scout's doing it because she hasn't taken a
break once since I got here, and there's no telling the last time she actually
had one.
“Hey,” I say gently, placing a hand on her shoulder and stepping up
behind her.
She freezes for a moment before she realizes it's me, then relaxes into
my touch. I think it's a good thing I'm standing so close to her because I
swear she's about to collapse into my arms. I'd catch her too.
“Take a break,” I tell her softly.
“Huh?” She seems dazed, like she's working on pure instinct right now.
I honestly don't think she even knows what she's doing anymore.
“A break—you need one. Take it. I can handle the rest of these
customers.”
Her brows are crushed together when she finally spins around. I try my
hardest to ignore how close we're currently standing, but it's hard because
she's right there. We've never been this close before…and I don't hate it.
If she notices this too, she doesn't say anything.
“Let me take care of this,” I insist. “Go relax.”
She traps her bottom lip between her teeth, chewing on it as she
considers my offer. She's tired. She knows she's tired, but she's scared to
leave her baby in my hands.
It feels like forever before she finally nods and agrees to go. She unties
her apron from around her waist and slips it over her head. She makes
herself a fresh coffee, then disappears around the back side of the truck.
I take care of the last few people in line, then get to work on cleaning
the truck the best I can. It's a mess, but I'm sure once Scout sees how much
she's made today in tips alone, it'll all be worth it.
I laugh when I slide a bottle of nutmeg onto the shelf, noting the other
three bulk-size containers there. When I'm finished, I go looking for Scout.
I find her completely deflated, sitting hunched over in a fold-out lawn
chair. I've never been back here before, but it's clear she uses this area for
her breaks.
She looks exhausted, like she could sleep for the next twelve hours and
still not be rested. I approach slowly, dropping down into the chair beside
her.
She perks up when she hears it squeak and starts to stand, but I grab her
wrist to stop her.
“No. Rest.”
“But the truck…”
“Is fine. I put the Be Right Back sign up. We have fifteen minutes.”
“Yeah, but did you—”
“Lock down the register? Yes. It's all good.” I don't tell her I know how
to lock it down because I accidentally did it earlier and spent five minutes
figuring out how to get back into it. She should change her passcode to
something other than donuts.
“Oh.” She drops back into her chair. “Okay.”
We sit in silence for several minutes, both of us just trying to relax for
the first time in hours.
“That was…”
“Absolute chaos?” she finishes with a sardonic laugh.
“Yeah. I don't know how you do that regularly.”
“It's normally not so bad. I usually have help, but…”
“Carla?” I guess. She nods. “Fucking Carla.”
“When I texted her last night, she swore she would be in today for the
launch, but guess who didn't show when I was here to prep at five?”
“Fucking Carla?”
“Yep. So, I fired her, because you were right—I'm worth more than the
bullshit she was slinging my way.”
I grin. “Say that again.”
“I'm worth more than—”
“You are, but not that part. The other one.”
She peeks over at me, head tilted. Then she realizes what I'm asking,
and she laughs. Only this time, it's not sarcastic or mean. It's genuine.
“You were right, Miller.”
“Ah,” I say, stretching my legs out and folding my hands over my
stomach. “I love it when you say sweet things to me.”
She rolls her eyes, but I don't miss the way her lips tip up into a grin.
“I'm sorry she bailed on you. Was Stevie not available?”
“No. She had a thing at Macie's school. She helps out there a few times
a week. I couldn't ask her to ditch that for my little donut truck.”
I don't like the way she says little donut truck, like this doesn't matter
or something, but she's tired and worn out, so I don't say anything.
“I guess I'm going to have to hire someone else.” She groans, sitting
forward and dropping her head into her hands. “Ugh. I've done so well not
thinking about it all day, and now I am and—”
“Did you know a blue whale's dick is massive? We're talking eight to
ten feet easily.”
Her mouth hangs open as she stares at me in complete shock. After
several seconds, she shakes her head. “I… I… What the hell, Miller?”
I laugh. “Got you to stop thinking about Fucking Carla, didn't it?”
Slowly, her look of shock transforms into a soft smile, and I realize then
that I like her smile. A lot.
She settles back into her chair, looking a lot less stressed.
“Thank you,” she says quietly after a few silent moments. “For today.
You have no idea how much I appreciate it.”
“It's nothing,” I tell her with a shrug. “Besides, that's what friends are
for, right?”
She rolls her head my way, that same smile still playing on her lips.
“Yeah, I guess so…friend.”
“Holy shit!” I holler, jumping out of my chair. “You just called me your
friend!”
“Ugh.” She grumbles again, rising to her feet. “Don't make me take it
back already.”
“You can't. No takesies-backsies.”
“Oh, I can definitely take it back.” She points at me as she passes. “And
I will, so behave.”
I hold my hands up, trailing behind her as we head back, our fifteen
minutes up. “Yes, ma'am.”
We clamber back into the truck, and her eyes widen in surprise when
she takes in the state of things.
“Miller…” She says my name softly, like a prayer. “You cleaned up?”
“Best as I could. I wasn't sure where to put some things, so I left those
out.”
“This is a million times better than it was.”
I shrug, not telling her I'm kind of a neat freak thanks to all my years
having to pretend to have the perfect family. When you have a family like
mine, you get good at cleaning up messes and making things look put
together real fast.
“You really didn't have to do all this, but I appreciate it so much. I don't
know what I would have done without you today.”
I'm not sure why, but her words strike me right in the chest and settle.
They burrow into the cavity and latch onto something deep inside of me.
“It was nothing.”
She pins me with a stare that says she knows I'm lying. I'm a fucking
pro hockey player whose season is careening closer every day; it's not like I
don't have things to do. I'm supposed to be training. I'm supposed to be
finishing up paperwork. I have homework, like watching tapes and getting
ready for a grueling six-plus months ahead of me.
But she lets me have the words anyway and begins cleaning up the rest
of the supplies, dropping them into the sink with a promise to clean them
later. We work side by side, picking up the truck and packing away some
leftovers she's sure she won't be able to sell today.
“Well fucking well,” a voice calls from out front. It's followed by a low
whistle and a laugh. “I didn't expect to find you here.”
Shit.
I peek up from the donuts I'm currently boxing up to find Greer
grinning at me smugly.
“Hey,” I say like an idiot.
He laughs. “Hey? Hey? That's all I get? Especially when you're here
with donut girl?”
“Her name's Scout.”
“Oh, good. You remembered,” the woman in question says, sliding up
next to me. “Not sure we've officially been introduced.” I've been on the
receiving end of her icy stares enough times to know that's what she's
sending Greer's way right now. She looks polite and sweet, but the look
she's giving him is anything but.
“Greer.”
“Do you work with Miller or something?”
He lifts a brow, his jaw tightening when she doesn't recognize him. His
ego is big enough that it annoys him, but it entertains me.
“Or something,” he mutters, then looks at me. “You get the group text?”
I know which one he's referring to without asking. It was a chain put
together by Smith when he retired that includes him, me, Wright, Rhodes,
Lowell, and Greer. We have a strict no-work-talk policy in place. It's just a
place for us to shoot the shit and keep in touch.
I pull my phone out of my pocket, surprised to find a ton of unanswered
texts. I've been ignoring it all day, and now I wish I hadn't.
Smith: I'm saying this as your friend, but I swear, if any of you
show up without dates, I'll make you skate circles for shits
and giggles.
Wright: As your friend…fuck off. You're not even our real
coach, old man.
Smith: Am too!
Wright: Whatever you say, Apple.
Rhodes: You do realize most of the guys in this chat are
married, right?
Lowell: I'm not married.
Wright: No, but you're stupidly in love with your baby momma.
Lowell: Damn right I am.
Rhodes: Aw, he's finally found his feelings. How sweet.
Wright: Like you're one to talk, Beast.
Rhodes: *middle-finger emoji*
Smith: What? No comments from the rookie?
Lowell: He's not a rookie anymore. We're not allowed to call
him that. We gotta get a better nickname for him.
Rhodes: How about little shithead?
Wright: Or numbnuts?
Lowell: Come on, guys…
Wright: You ruin all the fun, Captain.
Rhodes: Yeah, who else are we supposed to make fun of?
Greer?
Greer: Go for it. I have no feelings.
Greer: And don't worry, I have a date lined up. Can't speak for
Miller, though.
Smith: Dammit. Someone get the kid on board.
Greer: Whatever you say, Gramps.
Smith: *middle-finger emoji*
With a groan, I shove the phone back into my pocket.
Scout wasn't the only one who used today as a distraction from her
issues. The guys have been on my ass all week about getting a date for the
fundraiser. I'm down to just two weeks to find someone, and my options
still aren't looking good. To be fair, I haven't been spending any time
looking either.
“So, have you found a date yet?” Greer asks. “Or do you need help
considering your…” He flicks his eyes to Scout. “Issue.”
Fuck. I haven't, and he knows I haven't, which is going to make this ten
times more embarrassing to say in front of Scout.
“I—”
“You didn't tell him, Miller?” Scout says, bumping my shoulder
playfully and giving a flirty smirk, a far cry from how she normally is with
me. Then she looks at Greer. “I'm his date.”

SCOUT
“I'm his date.”
What the fuck, Scout?! What are you doing?
Greer looks from me to Miller and back to me again. It's clear he's
sizing us up, trying to decide if he's going to believe us or not.
I hope he does because being embarrassed by two different hockey
players in one month would be truly traumatizing.
After a few moments, a smile spreads across his face. “Well, smack my
ass.” He shakes his head. “Didn't expect that one, but I'm happy all the
same. Smith will be too.”
“Smith?” I question.
“Yeah, he's heading the fundraiser you're my date for,” Miller says,
widening his eyes at me, encouraging me to play along.
“Oh, yeah.” I nod. “That's right. You told me that. Duh.” I smack my
forehead. I force a grin Greer's way. “Sorry, long day. Speaking of…can I
get you anything?”
“An iced coffee would be great. Black, please.”
I scurry away to fulfill his request but keep my ears tuned in to the
conversation they begin to mutedly have the moment my back is turned.
“When the hell did this happen?” Greer asks. “And how? I thought she
hated you.”
“I'm charming,” Miller insists, and I can just picture him grinning like a
fool.
“You're an idiot, and we both know it. You're not paying her, are you?”
I'm insulted by that accusation for myself and for Miller. Is he really
insinuating that Miller would have to pay someone to date him? He's a
damn hockey player! There is no way women aren't falling at his feet. Or
skates. Whatever.
“No, asshole. This is completely consensual. Trust me, I was just as
surprised by it as you are.”
I tuck my lips together, trying not to laugh because, for once, he's not
lying. I have no idea why I said I was his date. I don't even know what I'm
his date for. I also have no idea what issue he was referring to—though that
part does have me curious—but I'm not going to let Miller be picked on by
his teammate.
“You swear you're not coercing her?”
“I swear to God, Greer, I will nail your nuts to the locker room benches
if you insult me again. I'll—”
“Here's that coffee,” I say, spinning back around, cutting off whatever
threat was going to tumble from Miller's mouth next—not because I'm
worried for Greer, but mostly because I find it insanely hot to see Miller get
all worked up.
They break apart, and Greer shoots me a grin I suppose is meant to be
charming but is nothing like the ones Miller throws my way. There's
nothing genuine about it.
“Thanks,” he mutters, taking a sip, eying his teammate the whole time.
They're having a silent conversation now, much like the ones Stevie and I
have. I'd kill to know what they're saying. “So, what happened here today?
How'd you rope Miller into getting behind the register?”
“I didn't. He volunteered.”
Greer's brows shoot up at that. “Interesting.”
“Not really,” Miller mumbles. “Is that all you stopped by for? Coffee?”
His teammate laughs at his obvious annoyance. “Yep.” He takes another
sip, then smacks his lips. “Ahh. Refreshing.”
“Oh my god!”
A distant voice calls out, and we all turn our attention to find Stevie
practically dragging my niece behind her as they hustle toward the truck.
When she approaches, she takes in the messy picnic tables and the trash
cans that desperately need to be emptied and winces. “I am so sorry, Scout.
I couldn't bail on Macie, though. I—”
I hold my hand up, stopping her. “It's fine. Macie comes first. I
understand.”
I look over the edge of the truck and wave down at my niece, but she's
not paying me any attention.
Instead, she's looking up at Greer, her brows slammed down tight,
scowling up at him. I want to chastise her for being impolite, but then I
notice what Greer's doing…he's scowling at her too.
“You're tall,” she tells him.
“You're short,” he shoots back with just as much sass as she's throwing
his way.
She curls her lips back at him, and he does the same. It's comical
watching a grown man sneering at a little girl.
Macie being Macie, she crosses her arms over her chest and doesn't
back down. “Are you going to win us a Cup this year? Because if not, I'm
sure Johnson can step in as goalie.”
Miller lets out a low laugh, and Macie turns her fiery gaze his way.
“Your shots on goal were down last season, you know. You have no
room to be laughing at him.”
“Yes, ma'am,” he says, and I swear he stands up straighter as if afraid of
the nine-year-old.
Not that I'd entirely blame him. Macie can be quite scary at times. She's
got fire, that's for sure.
“Macie May, you're being rude.”
She puffs her chest out. “I'm being tough, like Coach Heller. One day,
when I'm an NHL coach, my team is going to win just like this team will.
Just wait and see.”
I love that she's already planning to infiltrate a male-dominated
industry. Hell, I just might believe she could do it too.
“You're going to be a coach?” Greer challenges. “How about you get all
your teeth before you start bossing people around, huh?”
Her stare could make grown men crumble to their knees.
But not Greer.
He just laughs, which fires her up even more. I feel like she's about two
seconds away from hauling off and kicking the guy when Stevie steps up to
him.
“How about you stop picking on a little kid and maybe stop a puck or
two, goalie?”
Greer's eyes darken at her words, and a muscle begins to throb in his
jaw. “That so?”
“Yep,” Stevie says, not backing down. It's where Macie gets her spark
from. My sister is one of the strongest women I know. She's been through a
lot, and I know she makes sure her kid is strong because of it. “That's so.”
“Hmph.” Greer makes a non-committal noise, then turns to Miller.
“Don't forget to let Smith know about your…date.”
Stevie's head whips my way, and I do my best to ignore the stare she's
sending me. I already know we're going to be discussing this later, even
though I have no clue what to tell her other than I've clearly lost my mind.
“Bye, Twerp,” he says to Macie.
She bares her teeth at him, staring him down until he's in the parking
lot, then she hitches her thumb over her shoulder toward him and says,
“What's up his ass?”
“Macie!” Stevie admonishes.
“What? You said I could say ass sometimes!”
“I said you could say jackass.”
“Fine. Then what's up his jackass?”
“Oh my god. I swear, kid…” Stevie hangs her head, trying not to laugh.
“Come on,” she says, nudging Macie. “Let's go clean these tables up for
Auntie Scout.” Stevie gives me a pointed look that says We'll talk about this
later, then begins picking up the mess the customers left behind.
When she and Macie are out of earshot, Miller turns to me.
“You can bail, you know. You didn't have to do that and save me in
front of Greer.” He drags his hand over the back of his neck, something I've
noticed him do before. I wonder if it's a nervous thing. “You don't even
know what it's for, and I know you probably don't want to spend time with
me, and that's fine. I get it, so you're good. We're good. You don't have to
go.”
“Are you finished?” I ask when he's done rambling on.
He tips his head to the side. “Yes?”
“Good. Now, hush and tell me the details. I'm going to need to wear a
fancy dress, I assume.”
“You're…” His tongue darts out to wet his bottom lip. “You're going?
Are you sure?”
I lift a shoulder. “Sure. Why not? You bailed me out big-time today. I
figure I owe you one. I'll be your date, Miller—but as friends, nothing
else.”
A slow, satisfied smile stretches across his face, and I have to fight back
my own grin.
“Friends, huh?” he asks.
“Friends.” He fist-pumps the air several times, and I point at him.
“Don't make me regret this.”
“Me? Never.”
Then he winks.
And I swear my crush grows just a little stronger.
“Please tell me this isn't a joke and you actually are meeting the Grady
Miller for a date?”
I sigh, pulling a shirt off the hanger. “It's not a date. We're just going
shopping.”
“Right. For your date.”
I slip the mustard yellow t-shirt over my head, hiding my eye roll. It's
been four days since the Donut Day from Hell, and I still can't believe I,
Scout Thomas, made plans with Miller to go shopping.
Apparently, this event I'm attending with him is for a fundraiser that's
helping raise money to get hockey equipment and practice space for
underprivileged areas. It brings in a lot of cash for a good cause sponsored
by professional athletes, which means there are going to be a buttload of
photographers there. Those were Miller's words, not mine.
So, we're dress shopping.
I told him I could find something to wear on my own just fine, but he
refused to take no for an answer, insisting he was paying for the dress. Who
am I to pass up free clothes?
Stevie throws herself back on my bed with a dreamy sigh. “My sister,
dating a hockey star…who would have thought?”
“For the billionth time, we aren't dating. It is one date, and it's for
charity, which means it doesn't even count.”
“Yeah, but it could be the start of something.”
I bark out a laugh. “Ha. Not happening.”
“Why not?” She rolls onto her stomach and kicks her feet back and
forth, watching as I yank and pull my jeans over my wide hips. “He's
not—”
“I know he's not,” I cut her off. “But it's not going to happen, so just
drop it.”
She lifts her brows at my stern words. “Can I just say one last thing?”
I groan, knowing she's not going to let it go. She never does, so I
motion for her to speak.
“He's nice.” I open my mouth to argue, but she holds her hand up.
“Aside from that one stupid thing he did, he seems like a really good guy.
He helped you run your truck. He—an actual NHL player—helped you run
your truck when I'm sure he has a million other things to do. That is nice.”
I try to speak again, but she beats me to it.
“On top of all that…you like him. Hell, you've been crushing on him
for like two years now. And sure, I know it's mostly innocent, but why does
it have to be? If he's interested in you, go for it. He makes you smile. He
makes you laugh. And honestly…” She looks pointedly at the stacks of
romance novels scattered throughout my room. “You need a little something
in your life to shake things up. You can't hide forever.”
I follow her gaze, trying to see what my room looks like through her
eyes. Probably sad and lonely and boring, even though it's not.
I'm not ashamed of my reading habits. Hell, I could have much worse
hobbies. But I also know at some point, I have to stop hiding behind the
pages of a book and actually live, which is what she's getting at.
I want to. I really do.
But I'm also scared.
What if I get hurt? I've had my heart crushed enough in my short life. I
don't want it obliterated again.
Also, if I'm not out living life and trying new things, how am I ever
going to really be able to write a book about an epic romance? I mean, sure,
there's my imagination and all that, but sometimes that real-life epic
experience makes it all that much more believable. I follow all of my
favorite romance authors on social media, and they're always posting about
how funny or hot or charming their husbands are, how they met in the
sweetest ways, how they're soulmates.
I want that and I want the career.
I love baking and making donuts, but I love love just a little more,
especially after witnessing what my dads had together.
“I know,” I mutter. “I know. I'll work on it.”
“And if by chance at the end of your date he asks you on another, you'll
say yes?” She bats her lashes at me.
I laugh. Like legit laugh out loud.
Miller being interested in me? Yeah right.
“That's not going to happen.”
“It could.”
“It won't, Stevie. You're nuts.”
“Am not! In fact, I'm so sure it will happen because I have eyes, and
I've seen the way that boy looks at you. I want you to pinky swear that if he
asks you out, you'll say yes.”
“Fine.” I cross the room, hooking my little finger with her outstretched
one. “I pinky swear. But I'm only doing this because I know for a fact it'll
never happen.”
“Uh-huh.” She smiles smugly. “We'll see about that.”
I refused to give Miller my address.
Not because I don't trust him, but because I didn't want him to see my
apartment. He's a multi-millionaire, for crying out loud. The last thing he
needs to see is that I live with my sister and her daughter.
So, I made him meet me at the donut truck.
He's already waiting for me when I pull my trusty old Toyota into the
lot. It's almost comical when I park it next to his very expensive, very
luxurious car.
I do one last mirror check to make sure I didn't sweat off all my makeup
on the drive over, then shut off my car and hop out.
“Hi, friend,” he says, pushing off the back of his vehicle.
“Miller,” I respond coolly.
He chuckles. “You ready?”
“As I'll ever be.”
I'm shocked when he follows me to the passenger side and pulls my
door open for me.
“What?” he asks when I peek up at him. “I'm a gentleman.”
“That is not a word I would use to describe you.”
“Which word would you use, then?”
“Annoying. Irritating. Obnoxious. An absolute pain in my ass.”
“That's six words.”
“Huh?”
“An absolute pain in my ass—that's six words.”
“Point proven,” I say, sliding past him and into the car.
The minute I settle in, I'm assaulted by the scent that's all Miller. It's
woodsy with just a hint of something else I can't quite place. It's
intoxicating.
“Are you sniffing my car?”
I startle, because I didn't even realize he'd already gotten in.
“Uh…yes?”
His lips twitch, but he lets it go. “You okay with stopping and grabbing
some coffee? I'm exhausted after practice.”
“Oh, I could run into the truck and get us some if you want.” I grab the
handle, but he wraps his hand around my other wrist, stopping me. His
touch is like a warm blanket on a cool autumn night, and I swear I feel it
down to my toes.
“No,” he says. “Today is your day off. Enjoy it.”
“It's just coffee…”
He shakes his head. “Nope. You need to get out of that truck. No
working today, got it?”
I find myself nodding, agreeing to the demand he has no business
making. “Okay.”
“Good.” He removes his hand, and I instantly feel cold.
Then he smiles, and that same heat is back.
No—it's worse than before. I don't feel it in my toes; I feel it between
my legs.
I swallow down the lump forming in my throat and force a smile of my
own. “So, where to?”
“Figured we'd stop by Cup of Joe's and then hit up Julia's?”
“That shop downtown?” He nods, and I laugh. “Yeah, no. They are not
going to have my size there.”
His brows squeeze together. “Why not?”
I wave a hand over my body. “Because I'm not exactly small, Miller. I
have big hips. I have an even bigger ass. I have stomach rolls that aren't so
keen on being squeezed into tight dresses. I'm not a walk-into-any-storeand-find-a-dress kind of girl, and we don't have time to order something.”
“Yeah, but—”
I shake my head, cutting him off. “No. I know a place where we can
go.”
“Are you sure?”
“Yup.” I clap my hands together. “Chop-chop. We don't have all the
time in the world. We have a deadline with this.”
He sends me one last long glance but puts the car into drive.
If I thought Miller's driving was erratic as a bystander, it's nothing
compared to being a passenger in this thing. He whips around like a maniac,
taking corners sharply and changing lanes without warning. He's zinging
and zipping around like he's driving a damn go-kart, and by the time we
grab coffees and make it to the dress shop, I'm about three seconds away
from having a massive panic attack.
“Oh lord!” I cry out when he parallel parks like a pro. I'm pretty sure
even after ten tries, I'd still be attempting to fit my tiny car into the spot.
Despite his protests for me to wait, I exit the vehicle on shaky legs, needing
to get out before I freak out.
“You could have waited, you know,” he says once he catches up to me. I
don't miss how he tugs his baseball cap down on his head, and I want to tell
him it's no use. He's a six-foot-three giant with the build of a damn Greek
statue. Famous athlete or not, he's going to be noticed anywhere he goes.
“And you could have driven a lot less like you were Lewis Hamilton.”
“You know who Lewis Hamilton is?”
“Um, have you seen him? Of course I know who he is.”
Miller scoffs, then places his hand on my lower back and leads me
toward the shop. I spend the entire thirty-second walk trying not to pass out
from the feel of his fingers grazing my skin because I have no rational
reactions when it comes to Miller.
We stop in front of the door, and he peers down at me, those barley
colored eyes of his boring down into me. “You ready?”
To shop with Grady Miller? To have him witness the absolute monster I
turn into whenever I'm trying on clothes because I get irritated and hot and
dislike everything I put on my body?
Not a chance in hell.
As much as I want to, I don't say that.
Instead, I mutter, “As I'll ever be.”

MILLER
We've been in the store for forty minutes, and Scout has tried on no less
than ten different dresses.
All of them are wrong.
“No. Next.”
“Excuse me?”
I barely glance up from my phone, but it's long enough to see it's still
not the right dress. “That's not the one. Next.”
She huffs, her hand going to her hip. “You didn't even look.”
“I did, and it's a no.”
“Miller…come on. I've tried on so many dresses already, and you've
said no to every single one. My boobs are sweating, and I'm starving.”
“We'll go to lunch after this, I promise. And besides, have there been
any dresses that you love?”
She chews on her bottom lip, which tells me just what I suspected—no.
Don't get me wrong, she's looked incredible in just about every single
dress minus the one that had feathers—because, well, it had feathers—but
none of them are the one.
“How much longer is this going to take? It's a charity fundraiser, not a
red-carpet event.”
I sigh, then look over at the shopkeeper, who is watching all of this
unfold. “Can you grab the forest green one?”
Her eyes light up, and she nods enthusiastically before turning away to
grab it.
“What forest green one? And why are you saying things like forest
green? You're a guy.”
“First of all, that's sexist. Men can know colors. Secondly, I like to, uh,
color.”
She tilts her head. “You like to color?”
“Yeah.” My cheeks begin to warm because fuck, now that I'm saying it
out loud, it sounds stupid, and for some reason, I really don't want to look
stupid in front of Scout.
“Like…in coloring books?”
“Adult coloring books, but yeah.” I shrug, shifting around in the chair
I've been parked on since we arrived. “It's relaxing. Sometimes it's helpful
after stressful stretches of games.”
Her lips pull into a smile. “That's cute.”
I narrow my eyes. “I feel like you're making fun of me.”
“I'm not!” she insists. “I honestly think it's—”
“Cute?”
“Yeah. Cute.” Another grin. “It's…you.”
I like the way she says that, like it's something she means, like it's a
good thing.
“Here's that dress,” the shopkeeper says, thrusting it into Scout's arms.
She looks down at it, confused. “Where did this come from?”
I lift a shoulder. “It was on one of the racks you didn't look at.”
“Yeah, because I don't want anything strapless. I…don't have the arms
for strapless.”
I want to walk up to her, grab her by the shoulders, and shake her
because she's clearly out of it if she thinks there's a single thing wrong with
any part of her body.
“Try the dress on, Scout.”
She eyes the fabric draped over her arms, mulling it over.
I know she's going to love the dress if she just gives it a try. I know
she's going to love it because I love it, and I want her to see herself from
my point of view.
“Please,” I add, and she finally looks up at me.
“Fine,” she says with a soft sigh, shaking her head like she can't believe
she's about to actually do it, then she slips behind the curtain.
The shopkeeper looks over at me, grinning like a fool because I bet she
knows what I know—that Scout is about to walk out of that dressing room
looking like a million bucks.
“I'm going to go check on the front, but I'll be right back,” the woman
says to me.
I nod my thanks, she disappears, and I wait.
Then wait some more.
And more.
After what feels like twenty minutes, I can't take it any longer. I rise and
make my way over to the dressing room.
“Scout?” I call out softly.
She lets out a loud yelp and flings the curtain open. “Jesus, Miller! You
scared me!”
She's glaring at me, I'm sure, but I can't be bothered to care right now.
Because this dress? This dress is the one.
It's hugging her everywhere it should be—her tits, her waist, and her
ass. And the slit up the front? It's so fucking hot. It's just enough to tease
but not enough to be inappropriate. I'm already sad I'm going to have to
wait so long to see her in it again.
She looks… “Stunning.”
“Huh?”
Fuck. Did I say that out loud?
I clear my throat, then drag my eyes back up her body to her face. “You
look stunning, Scout.”
Her cheeks turn redder than I've ever seen them get. “Stop it.”
The words are whispered.
“What?”
“Stop it,” she repeats, a little louder this time.
“Why?”
“Because you don't mean it.”
“I don't?”
She shakes her head. “No. You're just saying that because I'm doing
you a favor by being your date and you feel obligated. Or maybe you still
feel bad about not recognizing me. Or—”
Her words are cut off when I begin stalking toward her.
She takes a step back. I take another forward.
Back. Forward.
Back. Forward.
Like I'm a fucking lion, and she's my prey.
I have no clue what's come over me. All I know is I can't stand here and
listen to her not believe me.
“Miller…” She says it quietly, and I'm not quite sure if she's asking me
to come closer or to step away.
“I want to set a few things straight, Scout.”
She swallows thickly.
I lean closer, trying not to get drunk on the sweet scent of baked goods
that seems to cling to her skin. “I'm not saying anything because I'm
obligated to. I'm saying it because I mean it. Also, I will never lie to you,
ever. If I say you're stunning, it's because I believe you are. And you are,
Scout. You're stunning.”
Her breath hitches, and her pupils dilate at my words. She's peering up
at me with those damn hazel eyes she won't stop rolling, and we're trapped
together inside the small changing room. I have a feeling I could do
anything I wanted to her right now, and she'd let me.
Like kiss her. And at this moment, I really want to kiss her.
I don't know where the thought comes from. I also have no fucking clue
how I'm supposed to feel about it, especially since we're just supposed to
be friends.
I do know I hate the way she's talking about herself, hate that she can't
see how gorgeous she looks right now.
“You're stunning, and I wish you could see it.”
I spin her around until she's facing the mirror.
I grab her waist to help keep her steady—or at least that's what I tell
myself. Really, it's just an excuse to touch her because I really want to
fucking touch her.
“See this dress?” I say, dropping my lips to her ear, loving the way she
shivers at our proximity. “See the way it hugs every inch of your body?”
She nods.
“See how gorgeous you look? It's like this dress was made for you,
Scout. Like they saw your body, and they knew they had the perfect
garment for it.”
Unable to stop myself, I drag my fingertips along her arm. I trace a path
from her wrist all the way up to her collarbone, then back down again. With
every stroke, her breaths grow quicker.
I should stop touching her. I know that. But I can't, and I don't want to.
I don't think she wants me to either.
I need to, though. Every second I spend close to her…every time I feel
her skin under my fingertips…my cock grows harder.
“Do you believe me now?”
She nods slowly.
“Say it.”
“I believe you.”
The words are shaky and unconvincing.
“Again.”
She rolls her tongue along her bottom lip, letting her eyes wander over
her reflection in the mirror. She takes in the way the deep green dress wraps
around her body. The way it pushes her tits up high—so high, in fact,
they're almost to the point of spilling out. The way it wraps around her
waist, creating a soft bunch of material that leads to a slit that comes
dangerously close to showing everyone just what she's wearing underneath.
The way it truly does feel like this dress was made for her.
She tips her chin up higher and straightens her back a little more.
Then, she says, “I believe you.”
And this time, I believe her.
“Since you picked our shopping destination, does that mean I get to pick
lunch?” I ask, looking over at Scout in the passenger seat.
The dress is tucked safely in the back seat, along with a pair of gold
heels she wouldn't stop eying.
“I suppose. But no sushi.” She shudders. “I can't stomach it.”
“That's a travesty.” I swap lanes seamlessly, but I don't miss how she
clutches the handle as if I'm out here driving like a madman. “Pizza? I
know a really good place. Best pizza in town.”
“I won't lie, I'm a hard sell on pizza because there's a place where I
grew up that has the best pizza ever, but I'll give it a go.”
“Best pizza ever, huh?”
“Yep.” She says it so confidently. “Have you ever had macaroni pizza?”
“Isn't that just cheese pizza?”
“That's incredibly offensive. It's pizza with macaroni on it.”
“That sounds…”
“Like heaven?” She sighs. “I know. There's also a chicken tender pizza,
which is so good. And there's a stuffed-crust one with bacon and jalapeños.
Don't even get me started on their dessert pizzas.”
She moans. Like full-on moans.
I'm not ashamed to admit I find it hot. Hell, I've been sporting a halfchub since we walked out of that dressing room. It's been distracting, to say
the least.
I pull the car into the pizzeria and reverse into a spot, shifting the car
into park.
She snorts out a laugh. “Of course you're one of those guys.”
I don't even get to ask her what she means before she's out of the car. I
have a feeling she's not a big fan of my driving.
When we make it into the restaurant, which is a “seat yourself” type
thing, I steer Scout toward a table in the back. I know if I happen to get
recognized, I'm less likely to be bothered back here.
We grab the menus from the table and begin perusing them. It's nice
sitting here with her, not having the need to fill the silence that's stretching
between us. It feels comfortable.
“Mr. Miller!”
I pop my head up at the name being called loudly from across the room.
The owner of the pizzeria has his arms outstretched and a giant smile across
his face as he makes his way toward our table.
“John!” I call back to him, just as excited to see him as he is to see me. I
stand and fold my arms around him in a hug. He's a small guy, and I always
laugh when I think of how ridiculous we must look hugging.
“It's good to see you, kid,” he says, patting my back a few times before
letting me go. “You've spent too much time away. We need to fix that.” He
points at me, narrowing his eyes.
“The season is starting soon, so I'll be back in regularly. I promise.”
Hockey players are known to be quite superstitious, and most of them
have their own rituals before games, like taping their sticks a certain way or
listening to certain playlists. Hell, even Wayne Gretzky himself had his
famous Diet Coke ritual.
Mine includes pizza.
I know, I know. It sounds insane, but it works for me. I carbo-load on
pizza, nap, then play.
So, before every home game, I come here to Johnny Boy's Pizza &
Pasta.
“Good.” He pats my shoulder, then his eyes drift toward Scout, who is
still seated, staring up at us with a smile. “Ah! I see you brought a friend
today.”
I wave toward Scout. “John, meet Scout. She's the genius behind
Scout's Sweets over on Eighth.”
John's eyes light up. “Those donuts are amazing.”
“Thank you.” Her cheeks redden. “It's great to meet you, John. I'm
excited to try your pizza. Miller won't stop gushing about it.”
“This kid, huh? He's great for business.” John elbows me. “What're you
having to drink? I'll grab 'em for ya.”
“I'll take a root beer,” Scout says.
“You already know what I want.”
He waves a hand my way. “Yeah, yeah. You want the cherry shit. I got
ya.”
I settle back at the table as he walks away. Scout's grinning at me over
the menu.
“What?” I ask her.
She shakes her head. “Nothing. You're just…a little different than I
expected, is all.”
“Good different?”
She nods. “Yes.”
We leave it at that, mostly because I have no clue how to decipher the
look in her eye as she says this. It's somewhere between curiosity, disbelief,
and happiness. I'm not sure what any of it means.
John drops our drinks off at the table, and we place an order for a large
cheeseburger pizza—sans onions, per Scout's request. Blasphemous if you
ask me, but whatever.
“So, Scout…is that a nickname?” I ask, ripping the paper off my straw
and dunking it into my “cherry shit” or just Cheerwine as I like to call it.
“Nope. It's just Scout. A lot of people think it's a nickname, though. Or
at least they want it to be because they don't like it.” She shrugs. “But Pops
was a big literature fan, and I guess it's some character or something.”
“You never read the book you were named after?”
“Nah. Not really my thing.”
“What is your thing?” I ask. “I mean, you are a reader, right? I assume
that's why you always have the little library out in front of the truck, yeah?”
“I'm definitely a reader. I, uh, prefer romance novels.” She tucks a loose
strand of hair behind her ear, then rubs her lobe between two fingers. She's
fidgeting. “I write them too.”
I'm intrigued. “Why do you sound so nervous telling me that?”
“Most people don't take too well to that admission. They either judge
and turn their noses up, or they think I'm some sex-crazed maniac.”
“And are you? Some sex-crazed maniac?”
She laughs loudly. “Ha! As someone who hasn't had sex in…” She
trails off, biting her bottom lip and then shaking her head. “No.”
Wait a minute. Is Scout…
“I mean, I'm not a virgin or anything,” she says. Oh. Well, never mind.
“That would be a good storyline, though, wouldn't it? A virgin romance
novelist. I'm sure it's already been done. But, yeah, no. Not sex-crazed, not
a virgin. Just an author—or wannabe author.”
“You haven't published any books?”
Her shoulders deflate. “I haven't even finished a book.”
“Why not?”
“Well…” She sighs. “I have the truck. It eats up a lot of my time—
which is great. I'm super thankful for that, but…I also want to write.”
“Then write.”
She twists her lips. “It's a little more complicated than that.”
“Why?”
“I… I'm blocked.”
“Then get unblocked.”
“If only it were that easy,” she mumbles. “I haven't touched my book in
three years.”
“I'm no expert, but I feel like three years is a long time not to write for
someone who wants to be a writer.”
She nods. “It is. But the last time I wrote anything…” She lets out a
long breath and sinks lower into the booth. “It was before my dad passed.”
My heart sinks, not because I know what it's like to lose a parent, but
because of the way her face darkens, the way everything about her just
seems to deflate as she says the words. It's clear it was hard on her.
It also makes me feel like an ass because when she said she made a
donut for her dads, I just assumed they were both still alive.
“Shit, Scout. That sucks.”
“It's okay. I mean, I have another one, but—”
I cough out a surprised laugh, nearly choking on my Cheerwine. “Holy
fuck.”
“Sorry.” She winces. “Dead gay dad joke…too much?”
“No.” I shake my head, trying to get my breath back under control.
“Just was not expecting that.”
“Sometimes I default to dark humor when I get uncomfortable about it.”
She fidgets with her straw. “I get uncomfortable about it a lot, probably
because I don't talk about it often. Or at least that's what my therapist
Stevie says.”
“Your therapist's name is Stevie?”
“My therapist is Stevie.”
“I didn't know she was a therapist.”
Scout laughs. “She's not. She's just an older sister, and they love to
pretend they're therapists like they have everything in life figured out or
something, never mind they're just trying to navigate their own issues. I'm
sure you understand, though.”
“While I do have an older sister, she wasn't around too much when I
was younger. There's a nine-year age difference and she split the second she
turned eighteen, so I felt like an only child for a long time.”
“Really?”
“Yep.”
“How was that?” I grimace, and she doesn't miss it. “Uh-oh. That bad?”
“It was…” I lift a shoulder. “Something. On the one hand, I had all of
my parents' attention. On the other…well, I had all of my parents' attention.
Which, if you're Grady Miller, a kid who seems to be bound for many years
of great hockey, can be very exhausting.”
The corners of her mouth tug down in a frown. “I'm sorry, Miller. That
sounds hard.”
It fucking sucked, but I don't tell her that. It doesn't seem right when
she's telling me about her dead father.
“Do you and your sister at least get along?”
“We do now. After she moved out, it was like she became a completely
different person. She lives out in Seattle with my nephew. I don't get to see
them as often as I'd like, but with the new team out there, it's at least a
couple of times a year. What about your dad? How was he?”
“He was amazing.” A wistful smile plays on her lips. “We had a lot in
common. He was a huge book nerd, and because of that, I became one too.
We could talk about books for hours and never get tired of it, no matter how
much it drove Stevie and Dad nuts. He's the reason I want to be a writer.”
It's clear by the way she talks about him that he meant a great deal to
her, and not just because he was her dad. It sounds like he was her best
friend too. I can't imagine losing both in one swoop like that.
“And the reason you can't write?”
She nods. “Afraid so. I promised him I'd finish my book, but…”
“But?”
“It's not pleasant,” she warns.
I gesture for her to go on, far too curious about what she's going to say.
She sighs, sitting forward, resting her chin on her hand. “I had a very
serious boyfriend when Pops died. We were together for a few years, had an
apartment, and I thought he was going to be the one. I loved him, you
know?”
“Why do I get the feeling he's about to do some really douchey shit?”
“Oh, because he is.” She lets out a dry, humorless laugh. “I guess dating
someone who just lost their parent was too hard for him. So, he broke up
with me in the worst way: he banged someone else…at my father's
funeral.”
I swear I see red.
I've never understood that statement before right this moment, but I get
it now. It's like a blinding rage. The urge to pummel someone, the absolute
carnal need for violence…
I feel that.
Who does that shit? Who treats someone like that, let alone someone
who just lost their parent? What kind of person stoops that low?
“What's his name?”
Her brows lift. “Excuse me?”
“His name.”
“Miller…”
“What.” It's not a question, mostly because I can't fathom why she'd
expect anything else right now.
She slides her hand across the table, covering mine with it. The storm
brewing inside of me starts to simmer at her touch, and it's only then that I
realize my hands are balled into fists.
“Hey,” she says softly, drawing my attention away from where she's
touching me. “While I appreciate your anger, it's okay. I'm okay.”
“It's not okay, Scout.”
She gives me a half-smile. “You're right. It's not. But it was a long time
ago, and I'm working to move past it. Stevie says I'm kind of stuck in the
past sometimes, and I think she may be right. It's time for me to move on,
you know?”
I'm not sure if she's saying this to me or to herself, but I nod anyway.
“Okay. But…please tell me you at least decked the guy when you found
out.”
She grins. “Oh yeah—broke his nose. I kind of understand why you
guys like fighting in hockey. It's exhilarating.”
“Hot pizza!” John says, appearing at the end of the table.
We break apart, and I instantly miss her hand on mine, but I don't say
that.
Instead, I grin at the owner and thank him for the meal.
“Anytime. Enjoy.”
Scout slides a piece onto her plate, then hands me the spatula so I can
dig in.
“Ready to have your mind blown?” I ask.
She looks at the pie skeptically. “We'll see.”
She lifts the slice, gives it a sniff. Takes a small, tentative bite. Chews,
swallows, then takes another.
It's the second bite that gets her to crack, and she lets out a soft moan.
“Okay, fine. This is really good. It's not Slice good, but it'll do as a
runner-up.”
“Told ya.” I dig into my food, and we eat in silence for several minutes.
Just as she finishes her first slice, she says, “Hey, Miller?”
I peek up from my food to find her staring at me with serious eyes.
“Yeah?”
“Thanks.”
“What for?”
“For wanting to stand up for me. It…it means a lot.”
“Of course,” I say, swallowing down the emotion building in my throat.
“That's what friends are for, right?”
Her lips twitch. “Right.”
“For what it's worth, I think you should finish your book.”
“You haven't even read it—you don't know if it's good or not.”
“Nah, doesn't matter. I believe in you all the same.”
Her mouth opens like she's surprised to hear the words, but like she
needed to hear them too. Finally, after several seconds of silence, she says,
“Okay. I'll finish it.”
My chest swells with excitement, and we don't talk for the rest of the
meal.

SCOUT
I lied to Miller.
I'm never going to finish this book.
I'll never finish it because I've been sitting at this damn desk for an
hour and have exactly seven words typed up.
Title Here: A Novel by Scout Thomas
I don't even have a damn title!
I have ideas. Oh, man, do I have ideas. I have a literal notebook that just
says Ideas, for crying out loud. I've sifted through it no less than ten times,
but none of them feel right.
This whole process is stressing me out so much I'd rather be at my
donut truck stressing about how I'm going to find another baker.
I've had a few interviews over the last week since my shopping trip
with Miller, but just like all the ideas in that notebook, none feel right. I
have one more set up for tomorrow before the fundraiser, and if it doesn't
work out, I've decided I'm just going to run the truck by myself for the
foreseeable future because I am not cut out for the hiring part of this job.
Nobody ever said running your own business would be this exhausting, but
dang am I tired.
Which is probably why my brain isn't currently functioning. It
definitely doesn't have anything to do with the fact that I'm going on a date
with a pro hockey player tomorrow, and I'm certainly not so nervous I
wasn't even able to finish my glass of wine last night.
He's been stopping by the truck almost every day. He's only missed
coming by once due to a press thing, and I'll admit it felt weird not to have
him there. I have no idea how I'm going to cope with him actually being
gone for the season. Guess I'll find out on Monday when they leave for
their first preseason trip.
It's a little ridiculous how used to him I've become. He was always a
frequent flyer at the truck before, but now it's more than that. Sometimes I
have to actually kick him out and make him go away because he's being
obnoxious, which seems to be par for the course with him.
I won't lie…it's been nice having him around, especially since I'm soloing it at the moment. It makes time go by faster and keeps me distracted in a
good way.
Plus, he's not bad to look at.
Yeah, it's safe to say my little crush on him is still intact. Hell, it may
even be worse after the incident in the dressing room.
I have no idea what came over him, no idea why he cornered me, why
he touched me and made me feel like we were the only two people on the
planet.
But he did all of those things and then some.
I was so uncertain about how I looked in the dress, afraid it was
showing off too many of my stomach rolls, clinging a little too tightly to the
dimples on my ass, showing entirely too much boob. But when Miller
called me stunning and made me really look at myself, I didn't see any of
those things anymore.
All I saw was the way he was looking at me.
And I liked it.
Maybe I could conjure that feeling again—as if I haven't several times
this week—and channel it into my writing.
I position my fingers at the keyboard and begin to type.
“Knock, knock!” Stevie calls out, tapping her knuckles against my door,
interrupting me. She pushes it open, popping her head around the corner.
“Dinner's ready.”
“Macaroni and cheese?”
“Of course—it's Thursday.”
Every Thursday for the last year, Macie makes mac and cheese. I swear
it's how I'm able to tell what day it is half the time.
Sometimes she'll add something to it like ground beef or tuna.
Sometimes it's hot dogs, and once she did jalapeños, but it's always mac
and cheese of some sort. I love that she has the cooking bug, but sometimes
I wish she'd branch out a little more. There's only so much cheese and
noodles a person can eat.
Stevie's eyes bounce to my open laptop. They widen when she reads the
screen.
I slam the computer shut and rise from the world's most uncomfortable
chair, which I deeply regret purchasing. Maybe that's my issue, why I'm
unable to write.
I laugh to myself because I know it's not.
“Whatcha working on these days?” Stevie asks not so casually.
“Nothing.” Technically it's not a lie because that's what I typed—
nothing.
But we both know me just sitting at the computer staring at a blank
document was something. It's been over a year since I've done even that.
I want to write. I truly do, but my fingers don't seem to work every time
I sit down. Stevie's convinced it's because I don't have a life outside the
donut truck, and she may be right. I think writing was a massive part of my
connection with my father, and my grief blocks me.
Honestly, I'm sure it's a perfect storm of both.
“Whatever you say,” she says as I practically shove her out of the door.
We reach the small dining room table just as Macie sets the last bowl
down. Before sitting, I grab a bottle of root beer from the fridge, a Diet
Coke for Stevie, and a juice box for my niece.
“I added bacon tonight, Aunt Scout!” Macie says from my right as she
grabs forks from the drawer.
Okay, fine, the bacon does make me a little more excited for dinner.
“I bet it's going to be amazing,” I tell her.
“I've almost perfected the recipe too.” She passes the silverware to her
mother and me.
“You've been working on this for a year. Isn't the recipe perfect?”
“Not yet,” she insists, sitting down in her chair, tugging it closer to the
table with a loud scrape. “But close.”
We dive into the food, and it's just as good as all her other concoctions.
“So,” Stevie starts, “are you nervous about tomorrow?”
“What's tomorrow?” Macie asks.
“I'm going to a fundraiser the Comets are hosting.”
Her eyes widen at this information, and she sits up higher in her chair.
“You'll be there with the whole team?”
I nod. “Yep.”
“And she's going as Grady Miller's date.”
“A date?!” Macie squeaks out, clapping her hands together.
“As friends,” I clarify, sending a pointed glare Stevie's way. She doesn't
break under the weight of it. “It's just as friends.”
“You're friends with him?” Macie asks.
“Umm…yes. I guess I am.” At this point, I think I might be telling the
truth. Sure, I've told Miller we're friends, but not until after our shopping
trip and lunch date, when I spilled all of my secrets to him, did I really feel
like that might be true.
“Like boyfriend-and-girlfriend kind of friends?”
“No.” I shake my head. “Just friends friends.”
She twists her lips, her face scrunching up like she just ate something
sour and doesn't like it. “Hmm. Okay.”
Stevie points her fork toward her daughter. “For the record, I'm with
her.”
“I'm shocked,” I deadpan.
I love my sister, but she's driving me nuts about this whole fundraiser
thing. She's been dropping hints all week about how she thinks Miller and I
would make a cute couple. I keep telling her it's never going to happen, but
she doesn't believe me.
“Liar.” Stevie sticks her tongue out when Macie isn't looking.
“Can you get me an autographed puck tomorrow?”
“I'm sure I can swing it,” I say to my niece, unsurprised by her request.
She asked for one when I went to Smith's party too. Luckily, Wright was
kind enough to send one home with me for her. “Do you want Miller's
signature?”
She scrunches her nose. “No. And not one from the jackass from the
truck either.”
“Macie!” her mother cries out in protest.
“You said she could say jackass,” I point out.
Stevie hangs her head, her shoulders shaking with laughter. “I did say
she could say jackass.”
“All right, so no autograph from Greer either. Maybe Smith?”
Macie guffaws. “That old man? Nope. I want Beast's. He's dreamy.”
She bounces her brows up and down. I have no clue if she even knows what
dreamy means or if she just heard her mother lusting after Chris Hemsworth
again.
“All right. Beast's it is.”
“And maybe Coach Heller too?” She folds her hands together, sticking
her bottom lip out in a plea. “You'd be my favorite aunt.”
“I'm your only aunt.”
“Please?”
I sigh, but there's no real annoyance behind it. “Fine. I'll see what I can
do.”
“Yes!” She fist-pumps the air. “Also, it's your turn to do dishes tonight.”
“I'm going to get all these autographs for you, and you're still making
me do dishes? I thought I was your favorite aunt.”
“You are, but I also hate doing dishes, so…” She shovels the last of her
mac and cheese in her mouth, swallows, then hops off her chair. She presses
a kiss to my cheek before yelling “Bye!” and running off.
I look at Stevie, who is just shaking her head at her daughter's antics.
“That's your kid,” I say.
“I know. Don't you love her?”
“So much.” I really truly do. “I hope the guys are cool about the
autographed pucks.”
“I'm sure they will be. They all always seem nice when they stop by the
truck.” She takes a bite of her dinner. “Speaking of…now that the little ears
are gone, how are you really feeling about tomorrow?”
“Like I'm going to vomit.”
“Because you're still crushing on Miller, and you're worried seeing him
all dressed up in his tux is going to send your lady bits into overdrive, and
you'll have to ravage him in the coat closet?”
A laugh bubbles out of me. “I thought I was the storyteller here.”
She lifts a shoulder. “What? I have an overactive imagination
sometimes, especially when I haven't been laid in ages.” She mutters the
last part.
She doesn't have to tell me twice. What I didn't finish telling Miller the
other day is that I'm not a virgin, but I may as well be. I haven't had sex in
three years. Haven't dated in that long either. It feels like a lifetime ago in
so many ways.
“I am nervous,” I tell her honestly.
She perks up at this. “You are?”
I nod. “Yeah. I… Well, I haven't been out with anyone since Aaron.” I
wince when I say my ex's name. “While this isn't a date”—I give her a
pointed look—“in some ways, it feels like it is. Probably just because the
event is fancy, I'm sure.”
“Right. Nothing to do with the fact that you're still crushing on Miller.”
“Shut up,” I tell her. “But yes. He's so…”
“Miller?”
I nod. “Is it weird to describe him that way? By his name?”
“No, not with a guy like him. He's his own brand of…well, him. It's
kind of hard not to find him attractive and obnoxious all in one breath. I
think you two are going to have a great time tomorrow.”
“I hope so.” I groan, running my hand through my messy hair. “I can't
believe I'm going to be in a room full of hockey players tomorrow. I hope I
don't do or say something embarrassing.”
“Trust me, I think Miller will embarrass himself enough for the both of
you.”
I laugh. “True.”
“Besides, the wives will be there, right? You can always mingle with
them, make some new friends. Live a little, have fun—you deserve it.”
For the first time in a long time, I think Stevie's right.
I do deserve it.
This is a lot more than I was expecting it to be.
A camera flashes in my face, which already hurts from smiling so much,
and I grip Miller's arm tighter because I'm now too blind to see much of
anything.
“Are you okay?” he asks out of the side of his mouth, somehow still
smiling at the camera.
I simply squeeze his arm in response because I'm honestly not sure if I
am okay. I feel like a fraud and like I look like a million bucks all at once.
It's hard to recognize who I am under all this makeup and glam, but it also
feels good to try something different.
There's at least another minute of posing and smiling—which doesn't
really sound like a long time, but when you have several cameras in your
face, it feels like an eternity—before we're finally free and walking through
the doors of the event.
“That was intense,” I say to Miller once we're inside the massive
entrance to the expansive venue.
“I thought the same when I first started playing hockey, but now I'm
just kind of used to being bombarded by cameras and microphones. I'm
sorry—I should have warned you better. If you had at least allowed me to
pick you up, maybe I could have.” He lifts his brows disapprovingly.
Miller insisted several times that he wanted to pick me up for the event,
but I just couldn't do it. I've already been a nervous wreck all week, and
there was no way I'd be able to sit through an entire car ride next to him
and not throw up all over the gorgeous gold heels he spent entirely too
much money on.
Instead, he sent a limo to my apartment. I felt like such a fool walking
from the tiny two-bedroom box to the fancy car.
I shrug. “It was out of the way.”
It's a damn lie, and we both know it.
“Are you nervous?” he asks.
This time, I don't lie to him. “I am.”
“Don't be. Once we get into the main room, it'll be just like normal.”
“Easy for you to say—you're not one who isn't used to dressing up and
pretending to be someone you're not. It's a little hard to relax when I look
like this.” I swoop my hand over my dress, trying to keep up with his long
strides.
Without warning, Miller tugs me out of the main entryway and into a
smaller hall. There's nobody else over here but us, and I'm keenly aware of
that when he crowds me against a wall.
“Miller, what are—”
“Have I told you yet how stunning you look in that dress?”
Heat fills my cheeks, and I have to bite down on my lower lip to control
the smile that's dying to break free. “Not today.”
“Well, that's on me, huh?” He steps closer, and I'm instantly wrapped in
the warmth that's radiating off his big body. “You're stunning, Scout.”
I meet his whiskey-colored eyes, my breath getting harder and harder to
catch the more I peer into them.
“Thank you,” I whisper.
“You're welcome.” He gives me his trademark smile. “Now, let's get
you a glass of champagne, huh? Calm those nerves.”
I'm almost certain drinking around Miller would be a bad idea. I think
I'd say things I shouldn't, do things I normally wouldn't.
But tonight…tonight I don't want to be just Scout.
I want to have fun. I want to let loose. I want to feel good.
So, I do the exact opposite of what I should.
I say, “Okay.”
And when he holds his hand out, I thread my fingers through his and let
him pull me into the night.

MILLER
I'm not sure if it's the three glasses of champagne that have calmed her
nerves, but Scout seems like she's fitting right in. I'm sure it helps that she's
already familiar with several of my favorite people on the team, most of
whom are currently seated around our table.
She's smiling at the conversation Lowell and Rhodes seem to be stuck
in, and I can't help but watch her watch them.
She wore her hair down tonight, something she doesn't do very often. I
have this weird urge to pull it off her neck and place my lips there instead
because seeing her in that dress again is making my head all fuzzy.
Or maybe it's the vodka I'm drinking.
“No, I'm telling you, Rhodes, it's not going to happen.”
“Come on. Then we can tell people we both got married in Vegas.”
“We're not even engaged!” Lowell cries out.
“Then propose, moron!” Rhodes argues back.
“Uh, hi,” Hollis says, poking her head around her boyfriend. “Do I get a
say in this?”
“No,” both guys say in unison.
“If it's any consolation, I vote Vegas too,” I chime in. “Who doesn't
want to get married by Elvis?”
“See!” Rhodes points at me. “For once, I agree with the kid.”
“I think you should have a wedding in October,” Harper, Wright's wife,
says to her sister. “Then you could use pretty pumpkins as décor.”
“Again, we're not even engaged. We haven't even talked about
marriage.” The captain sounds like he's had this exact conversation a
thousand times already.
“What? My sister-in-law is good enough for you to impregnate but not
marry?” Wright challenges Lowell with a lifted brow.
“Yeah!” Harper nods. “You knock my sister up, then what? Be her
boyfriend forever?”
“No!” He shoves out of his chair. “I'm getting a drink.”
He stomps off, and everyone at the table laughs. We all know Lowell
and Hollis aren't ready to walk down the aisle, but it doesn't mean we can't
tease them about it.
“You guys are so mean getting him all wound up,” Hollis declares in
defense of her boyfriend.
“Yeah, but he plays better when he's mad, and we could really use a win
on Monday to kick off the preseason.”
She shakes her head, but I'm sure she knows Rhodes is right on the
money.
“I'm not looking forward to being the only one on diaper duty,” Hollis
remarks, talking about her adorable new baby.
“We'll help you, you know that,” Harper says, nodding toward Ryan.
“I'll help too,” Scout says quietly from beside me. “I mean, if you need
it, of course.” She dips down in her seat when everyone stares at her. “I
have some experience with kids. I helped raise my niece.”
“Did you really?” I ask, surprised.
“Yeah.” She nods. “Macie's father is…well, he's not in the picture.” I
can see a cloud of darkness fall over her face. I'm sure there's a story there
regarding Macie's dad, but I know now isn't the place to ask for details, not
that I'm owed any. “It's just been me, Stevie, and Macie since the day she
was brought home from the hospital.”
“Gah! Babies are so cute when they're all tiny and squishy,” Ryan says
fondly. “You just want to boop their little noses.”
“Agreed.”
“You like kids?” Now it's Scout's turn to be surprised.
I'm one of those weird guys who wants a big family and loves children.
I know what an empty home feels like. I don't want that for my future.
I'm about to answer when Harper cuts in.
“They look like aliens. Someone send Sigourney Weaver to kick some
ass, because ew.” She wrinkles her nose.
Greer points at her. “I'm with this one. Babies and kids are gross.”
“Macie thinks you're gross,” Scout says to him, a tipsy laugh bubbling
out of her. “She calls you the jackass.”
Greer's face turns sour, but everyone else laughs.
“Smart kid,” Smith remarks.
“She calls you the old man.”
“Hey, that's what we call him too,” Wright says, earning himself a hard
glare from said old man.
“I might be old, but I can still whoop your ass.”
“Please. Like I'm scared of you.” Wright rolls his eyes just as Smith
reaches out and whacks him across the back of his head. For once, I'm not
the guy getting hit, and it feels nice not to be picked on.
“Hey! Be nice, or I'll tell Coach,” Wright threatens.
“Real mature, honey.” Harper pats her husband's cheek.
“I'm mature,” he mutters, which doesn't sound mature at all.
“Whatever. I'm getting a drink.” He rises from his chair.
“Do they have beer at this thing? I can't take any more of this
champagne,” Rhodes gripes, following behind Wright.
Their wives exchange glances and then go after them.
“So, when did this thing happen between you two?” asks Emilia, the
team's social media director and Smith's girlfriend.
Scout gestures from herself to me. “Us?” Emilia nods, and my date
barks out a laugh. “No. We're not… No.”
It's not her words that sting, because they're not wrong; it's her laugh—
almost like she couldn't fathom dating me, and I'm not sure how I feel
about that.
Do I want her to want to date me? Or am I just spending so much time
with her lately that she's in my head?
“That's right,” I say. “We're not together.”
“No?” Greer asks from across the table, rolling the bottom of his cup
around in circles over the table. “Hm.”
I scowl, not liking the sound that just came out of him.
“In that case,” he says loudly, rising to his feet. He extends his hand
across the table…right to Scout. “May I have this dance?”
“You dance?” She stares at his outstretched hand.
“I took ballroom lessons for my mother's third wedding.”
She glances at his hand again, then at him, and back at his hand. Finally,
she shrugs. “Why not? Just nobody tell my niece I danced with the jackass.”
Greer smirks at her. “It'll be our little secret.”
I hate his smirk, and I hate the way Scout smirks back.
I really hate that they have a secret.
Greer pulls Scout out onto the dance floor and tugs her so close her
body is snug against his. I know for a fact it's not ballroom etiquette
because I took ballroom lessons too.
He nuzzles her neck, whispering something into her ear while his
fingertips play along the cutout in the back of her dress. Scout throws her
head back, laughing at something Greer says.
They look good together. Scout looks happy.
I should be happy she's having a good time, should be glad tonight isn't
a complete disaster for her.
But I'm not happy because seeing Scout in Greer's arms is making my
blood boil. I hate it more than I've ever hated anything in my life.
And I hate that I'm not sure what the hell that's supposed to mean.
“Dude, Miller…” Smith says, and I feel his hand clamp over my own.
I look down and see that my knuckles are turning white against the glass
of vodka I've been sipping for the last two hours.
“Are you sure there's nothing going on between you two?” Emilia asks.
I hesitate only a moment before nodding my head. “Yes, I'm sure.”
“But…”
I swallow, not answering because, from the knowing smile on her face,
I'm not so sure I need to.
There isn't anything going on with us.
But I…I think I want there to be.
“Want my advice, kid? Talk to her. Tell her how you feel,” Smith says,
reading my mind. He looks over at his girlfriend. “It's something I wish I
had done a hell of a lot sooner.”
I'm out of my seat before I can realize what I'm doing.
I'm crossing the dance floor.
I'm shoving Greer out of the way, and I'm taking his spot.
Distantly, I hear him laugh, but I don't pay him any attention.
All I can focus on is Scout, who is staring up at me with wide eyes as I
pull her against me—breaking all ballroom rules myself. She lets out a tiny
squeak but doesn't protest the interruption.
I like that she doesn't.
We glide across the floor, not missing a single step, moving in perfect
sync with one another.
“This is unexpected,” she murmurs quietly.
“I took lessons, too.”
She tries to hide her smile, but I see it anyway.
I know how ridiculous I sound, how petty, how childish. But dammit, I
don't want Greer to dance with Scout. I don't want him to flirt with her. I
don't want him to know what she feels like in his arms because I want all
those things.
I want Scout.
I…
“Date me.”
She rears her head back, completely caught off guard by my words.
The feeling is mutual because I can't believe I just said them.
“What?”
“Date me,” I repeat. “I mean…” I clear my throat. “Would you like to
go on a date? With me, I mean.”
We've stopped moving. I'm not sure when that happened, but we have.
Now we're just standing here staring at one another.
And it's fucking unbearable. With every second that ticks by, I feel more
and more like a total moron.
Date me? Really? Fuck, it's no wonder I'm still a virgin with dating
skills like this.
I should take it back, should tell her to forget it…but I don't want to do
either of those things.
I have to say something, though, because this is doing nothing short of
killing me.
“Scout, I—”
“Okay,” she says, and the words die on my tongue.
Now it's me who leans back, surprised. “O…kay?” I draw the word out,
making sure she said what I think she did.
She nods. “Yes. I'll go on a date with you.”
“I…” I swallow down the excitement. “Okay. We're going on a date.”
“Yep.”
“It's going to be a good date,” I tell her, pulling her back in.
“Okay.”
We begin slowly moving to the music. “The best first date you've ever
been on.”
“That so?”
“Yep. It's going to—”
“Miller?” she interrupts.
“Hm?”
“Don't make me regret this already.”
I laugh. “Yes, ma'am.”
I firmly believe the only reason Scout is allowing me to drive her home is
that she's still a little tipsy from the champagne.
Well, that and I only booked the limo service for one way, so it was
either me or an Uber.
She chose me.
“This is my place.” She points up at the apartment building in front of
us.
I can see under the yellow streetlights that it's a little run down, but it's
not as if I was expecting to drop her off at a mansion or anything.
“It's not much,” she says like she knows what I'm thinking. “But it's
home.” She fidgets with the small wristlet purse she brought. “I, uh, live
with Stevie.”
“You live with your sister?” She winces. “Are you embarrassed by that?
Because you don't have to be. The first year I was with the Comets, I lived
with my coach. Now that's embarrassing. Talk about awkward when you
have to masturbate.” Oh fuck. “I mean, not that I masturbate. I—”
She throws her head back and laughs, and it reminds me of earlier when
Greer made her do the same thing.
“What did Greer say to make you laugh earlier?”
She looks surprised by the sudden change of subject. “Huh?”
I don't know why I care. I shouldn't care, but I do.
“Earlier, when you were dancing with Greer, you laughed like that.
What did he say to make you laugh so hard?”
The streetlights are just bright enough that I can still see the red that
colors her cheeks.
“He, um, he told me to do that.”
My brows squish together. “Huh?”
“He told me to laugh like he just told me something funny because he
wanted to test something.”
“He wanted to…” Holy shit. I shake my head. “That asshole. He was
testing me, wasn't he?”
She nods. “Afraid so.”
“And it worked.”
“It did, but…” She lets out a heavy breath, and I brace myself for her to
tell me she's taking back agreeing to a date, it's a mistake, and she doesn't
want to ruin our—reluctant on her part—friendship or something.
“I'vehadacrushonyouforawhile.”
It comes out in one big, long word, and I'm certain she didn't just say
what I think she did.
“What?”
She groans, cradling her face in her hands, then realizes a few moments
too late that she's wearing makeup and that's probably not a good idea. She
sinks down into her seat and takes another fortifying breath.
“I've had a crush on you for a while. So, I wasn't really mad about it.”
My brows shoot up. “You've been crushing on me?”
The red on her cheeks deepens as she nods. “Yes.”
“For how long?”
“Since you've been coming to the truck.”
Oh fuck. That makes me feel kind of awful.
I've seen Scout at the truck so many times over the years, but I never
really saw her until recently, and I can't believe what I've been missing out
on.
“I never knew,” I say quietly.
“I know.” She tucks her lips together like she's hurt by this, but also
maybe not surprised. “It's okay.”
“It's not. The guys on the team are right—I am a fucking idiot.”
Her brows furrow. “Stop saying that. You're not an idiot. You're not
stupid. You're just…well, you're Miller.”
“Is that a bad thing?”
She shakes her head. “Not at all. I happen to like Miller.”
“As a friend?”
“Or more.” She blushes again, then clears her throat. “Anyway, this is
me.”
I laugh. “Yeah, you said that.” I point at her. “Wait here.”
She giggles but remains in the car while I hop out. I jog over to her side
and pull her door open, bending at the waist in a dramatic fashion.
She laughs again, and I swear I love the sound of it more every time I
hear it.
She slips her hand into mine, allowing me to help her from the vehicle.
“Come on. I'll walk you up.”
“You don't—oh, okay,” she says when she sees the look I'm sending
her, daring her to keep challenging me.
Unsure of where to go exactly, I let her lead the way, but I keep my
hand on her lower back the entire way because I can't seem to stop touching
her.
My fingers rest against exposed skin. It's warm and soft, and I want to
touch more of her.
But I'm getting way ahead of myself.
We stop in front of a door that has a Carolina Comets-themed wreath on
it, and I can't help but laugh.
“I'm sure it's just because Macie is a big fan, but I'm going to pretend it
was you who picked that out so you could support your best friend.”
“Best friend, huh?” Her lips pull into a half-smile. “Wow, we're moving
fast.”
“It's because you can't get enough of me, always wanting me to be
around.”
“Whatever you need to tell yourself to help you sleep at night.”
“Oh, I don't need to tell myself anything. I sleep just fine knowing how
obsessed with me you are, Miss Crushing on Me for Months over here.”
“You know, the more you talk, the more I'm really starting to doubt my
sanity.”
“Nah. You like me.”
She rolls her eyes. “Despite your inability to get over yourself, I had a
really nice time tonight.”
“Yeah?” She nods. “Good. I did too. Especially the part where you
agreed to a date with me.”
She groans. “Ugh. I did, huh?”
“Yep, and I'm holding you to it—though it may not be until I get back
from these two preseason games…”
“That's fine. I'm sure I'm going to need time to prepare myself for it.”
“I promise to make it not suck.”
“Mm, we'll see about that.” She grabs hold of the door handle. “Thanks
again.”
“Anytime.”
She doesn't move. Neither do I.
We stand there in silence for several seconds, letting the cool,
September night air settle between us.
“I…um…good night,” she says.
“Good night.”
She laughs, dropping her eyes to where our fingers are still laced. “I
kind of need my hand back, Miller.”
“Right. But here's the thing—I kind of don't want to let go.”
“Kind of?”
“More than kind of. I definitely don't want to let go.”
I don't want to let go because I'm scared if I do, she's going to come to
her senses and tell me the date is off, and I really don't want that.
I like Scout. I like her a lot.
“But…” I draw the word out. “I suppose I'll allow it.”
“Thank you,” she says, but it seems like she doesn't want to let me go
either because I swear this is the slowest anyone has ever stopped touching
someone else.
When we finally let go, it feels weird, like I'm missing something vital.
I've never felt that before.
“Good night.”
“You said that already.”
“Well, this time I mean it.” She spins around, digging into her purse for
her key like she's trying to prove a point.
I can't help but laugh.
She glares over her shoulder at me.
I laugh harder.
“Stop it, Miller. I'll take our date back.”
I gasp dramatically. “You wouldn't dare.”
“Try me.” She finally retrieves her keys and inserts one into the lock.
“Hey, Scout?”
She sighs loudly, turning my way. “Yes?”
I take a step closer, closing the short distance between us. She gasps
softly at my sudden movements but doesn't shift back.
I swallow the knot lodged in my throat as she stares up at me, waiting.
“I'm sorry I didn't see you before, but I see you now.”
Her mouth floats open. Then closes.
Opens again.
Then, I swear she mutters, “Oh, what the hell?”
And her mouth crashes to mine.
I slide my hands over her waist, tugging her closer as she grabs my
lapels and does the same. Her back hits the door with a loud thud that will
likely wake a sleeping Stevie, but I don't care.
I don't care because I'm kissing her. I'm kissing her, and all I can think
is She tastes as sweet as she smells.
It's stupid and absurd, but it's exactly what I imagined her lips would
taste like.
And I need more.
I run my tongue along her bottom lip. She lets me in, letting out a soft
moan when our tongues slide together.
I've kissed many women before, but not even one of those kisses has
ever come close to comparing to this. It's soft and unhurried, like we're
both afraid to move too fast because then we know it will be over.
I have no idea how long we kiss, how long our bodies are pressed
together in the dimly lit hallway, how long we stand there holding on to one
another when our mouths finally drift apart. We're a mess of heavy breaths,
and I can feel her shiver beneath my fingertips.
I should go. I know I should. I just can't bring myself to move my feet.
I'm not sure how much longer I stand there, but it's long enough to hear
her teeth chattering, and I know then that I've overstayed my welcome.
So, with reluctance, I place one last kiss on her forehead and whisper,
“Good night, Scout.”
“Good night…Grady.”
I swear, I've never loved my name more.

MILLER & SCOUT
Miller: Did you know it's a really bad idea to eat four hot dogs,
a hamburger, and a milkshake before skating?
Miller: I didn't do that. Some rookie on the other team did and
barfed all over the ice. Totally disgusting.
Scout: Who is this?
Miller: What do you mean?
Miller: It's Miller.
Scout: Who?
Miller: M-I-L-L-E-R
Miller: As in…IT'S MILLER TIME, BABY!
Scout: You know, I was going to keep this going longer, but
you just ruined everything with that horrible pun, and I'm
considering blocking you.
Miller: Nah. You wouldn't.
Scout: And why not?
Miller: Because I'm a really good kisser?
Scout: Are you asking me that or telling me?
Miller: Telling.
Miller: Or maybe asking.
Miller: You know, I'm really not sure, mostly because now I'm
curious what you thought of our kiss.
Miller: So…what'd you think of our kiss?
Scout: There really is no beating around the bush with you, is
there?
Miller: About 98% of the time, no.
Scout: And the other 2%?
Miller: I'm not ready for the other 2% just yet.
Scout: That's fair.
Scout: Did someone get sick during the game?
Miller: Warmups.
Miller: I kind of felt bad for the guy. I've been the young, dumb
rookie before. It's rough sometimes.
Scout: You say that like you're not still young and dumb.
Miller: Hey, I'm 24, thank you very much.
Miller: Still dumb, though.
Scout: You're 24?!
Miller: Yup.
Miller: Wait—how old are you?
Miller: Actually, no. Never mind. I know you're not supposed to
ask women that.
Scout: Such a stupid rule.
Scout: I'm 28.
Miller: Oh, I've snagged an older lady. Nice.
Scout: Snagged?
Scout: OLDER LADY?
Scout: Keep it up. At this rate, you're going to be the one in
the grave first, not me.
Miller: I'm assuming you're going to be the death of me?
Scout: Yes.
Scout: Here lies Grady Miller. He died because he talked too
much shit.
Miller: That honestly checks out, though.
Scout: Have you always been this way?
Miller: Yes. My parents didn't love me enough as a child.
Miller: Sadly, that last part isn't a lie. They really didn't.
Miller: Womp, womp.
Scout: Okay, that's just depressing.
Miller: Sorry.
Scout: I'M sorry.
Miller: Eh, don't be. It is what it is.
Scout: That's a very sad way of looking at it.
Miller: It's practical.
Scout: Since when are you ever practical?
Miller: That's fair.
Miller: I gotta go, but I just wanted you to know I was thinking
about you.
Scout: Miller, you literally texted me about someone vomiting,
so I'm not sure that's the compliment you think it is.
Miller: If it makes you feel any better, I was thinking about you
before the vomit.
Scout: Gee, thanks.
Scout: For what it's worth, I was thinking about you too…and
our kiss.
Scout: AMiller: I've always been told I'm an overachiever, so now I
guess I have something to work toward.
Scout: ??
Miller: An A+
Scout: I'm stingy with pluses.
Miller: I bet I'm worth making an exception for.
Scout: We'll see about that.
Miller: What about Thursday?
Scout: It's a very disappointing day of the week, mostly
because it's not Friday.
Scout: Though to be fair, I don't really get weekends off, so
Fridays kind of suck too.
Scout: I'm sure you know all about that, though.
Miller: I do, but I meant what about Thursday for our date?
Miller: Unless you'd like to choose a less disappointing day of
the week.
Scout: Honestly, they all suck in some way. Except for
Saturday. Saturdays are wine-in-the-tub nights.
Scout: But Thursday is fine.
Miller: Wine in the tub?
Scout: Yep. I light candles, crank the Taylor Swift, drink the
fanciest of wines, and relax.
Miller: That sounds…nice.
Scout: Even the Taylor Swift?
Miller: Are you kidding me? Especially the Taylor Swift.
Scout: Oh, so you're a fan?
Miller: All I'm saying is there is no way in hell Jake doesn't still
have that scarf.
Scout: Right? He totally kept it!
Scout: Good luck at your game tonight.
Miller: Are you watching?
Scout: If being in the same living room as Macie as she
screams at the TV for you to shoot counts as watching, then
yes.
Miller: It's preseason! I'm saving all my good shots for when it
counts.
Scout: Try telling Coach Macie that.
Miller: She's going to be one tough cookie.
Scout: Going to be? She already is.
Scout: How about some motivation? If you win, I'll let you buy
dinner, and if you lose, I'll let you buy dinner.
Miller: So, I'm buying dinner either way?
Scout: Of course you are. It's a date.
Miller: That's not very feminist of you.
Scout: No, it's not. But I'm also not a super-rich hockey player.
Miller: I wouldn't say super rich. That'd be Lowell.
Scout: You make more a year than I'll ever make in a lifetime.
Miller: Did you Google me?
Scout: Of course I did. I like to know whom I'm dating.
Miller: That's fair.
Miller: I'm going to Google you later, just so we're even.
Scout: That sounds mildly sexual.
Miller: It does, doesn't it?
Scout: Totally.
Miller: I gotta go. Coach Smith is yelling at me.
Miller: See you Thursday.
Miller: And, Scout? I'm really looking forward to working on
my grade.

SCOUT
I'm beginning to think something might be seriously wrong with me.
That's the only reason I can conceive of for saying yes to so many
things involving Miller. First his apology, then accepting his help with my
truck, then the fundraiser.
And now? I said yes to a date.
A date! Me and Miller. Alone. Together. Doing date things.
I can't believe it.
Just like I still can't believe I kissed him.
I freaking kissed Miller!
My face heats and my lips get all tingly just thinking about it and the
way he pressed me against the door and kissed me somehow harder and
softer than anyone ever has before.
It's all that has been consuming my thoughts for the last week while
he's been tied up in the preseason. They played two road games, came
home and hit the ice hard with practice, then had two more away games. I
haven't seen him since the night of the fundraiser, and as much as I hate to
admit it, I miss him. Miller being gone is just as strange as I thought it
would be. It's like my whole routine is thrown off, which is ridiculous
because he's just a customer.
A customer I kissed and am going on a date with, but still. I'm not going
to get ahead of myself and think anything of it. I can't let my mind wander
there.
“Where do we keep the apple pie spice?”
I look over at the newest employee of Scout's Sweets, Rosie, then point
toward the counter she's standing right in front of.
“Second shelf, right there next to the nutmeg.” I can't help but think of
Miller when I say it, which has a smile curving my lips.
“You got it, boss.”
She bends and starts shoving spices around, moving the older containers
to the front and putting the new ones in the back.
Rosie started last week, and things have been great so far. There were a
few learning curves with the equipment, but she's getting the hang of it fast,
and it's truly been a relief to have help. I have a feeling she's going to stick
around, which means I'm finally going to have some free time to write,
something I've been itching to do every free second I get.
After Miller kissed the hell out of me, I wrote five hundred words. Five
hundred! That's more than I've done in years. I mean, when I read them all
back, I decided they were trash and deleted them, but it's still progress.
“What has you smiling?” Stevie asks, appearing out of nowhere. She
sets her purse on the hook by the back door and then leans against one of
the counters.
“She's been doing that all day,” Rosie says, ratting me out as she
organizes the spices.
“Is it because a certain hockey player is taking you out on a date
tonight?” My sister bounces her brows up and down, and I glower at her.
I wasn't planning on telling her about my date with Miller, but I didn't
have a choice. After I finally regained my senses after kissing Miller and
went inside, I about had a heart attack because Stevie was sitting in the dark
living room, waiting up for me.
She heard everything. Every word. Every moan. All of it.
And she couldn't stop grinning. Wouldn't stop asking questions until I
finally told her everything.
Sometimes I think she's more excited about the date than I am.
We've been texting off and on while he's not been around and finally
settled on going on our date tomorrow. I have no idea where we're going.
All he said was to wear a dress and heels, and for some reason that makes
me ten times more nervous about it.
“I still can't believe the Comets come here all the time,” Rosie says.
“I'm a huge hockey fan. I have no idea how I'm going to contain myself—
especially if Fitzgerald, that new trade from Vancouver, stops by.” She fans
herself, then looks sheepish. “Sorry. I get a bit excited about hockey.”
Stevie lifts her hands. “No judgments from me. There are a lot of hot
guys on the ice, that's for sure.”
“And who do you think is hot?” I lift a brow, curious.
“Uno reverse!” she calls out, avoiding the question.
I groan. “Not fair.”
“Is too!”
“What's Uno reverse?” Rosie asks.
“It means she's putting the question back on me.”
“And Scout here doesn't want that because she'll have to say she thinks
Miller is hot, and she doesn't like to admit her little crush.” Stevie grins
triumphantly, clearly feeling really proud of herself right now.
I scowl at her, but she doesn't care.
“Okay, but Miller is hot,” Rosie says. “So, no shame in that.”
I've never really been a jealous person before. It's not in my nature.
But when Rosie says Miller is hot, I swear a streak of it runs straight
through me because I can picture Miller sending her flirty smiles and using
cheesy pick-up lines on her, and I hate it.
I hate it so much my teeth grind against each other.
“But Fitzgerald is more my style,” Rosie says, and just as quickly as the
streak appeared, it's gone. “I assume Miller is the one you're going on a
date with?”
“Miller is the one she also shamelessly made out with against our front
door last week.”
“Stevie!”
“Wow. I didn't know I'd be getting all this juicy gossip this early on.”
Rosie rubs her hands together. “Tell me more. What was it like? Is he a
good kisser? I follow some hockey gossip sites and have seen him with
some other women before, but nothing long term.”
I frown because as much as I don't like admitting it, I've seen it too.
After I let the evening of the fundraiser settle, I jumped right to the last
place I needed to be—Google. I couldn't find any information on his dating
history aside from a few photos of him at various fancy-schmancy
restaurants around the city with women who looked like they could be on
runways. None of them looked particularly serious, but there was one thing
I could say for certain about them—all the women were my exact opposite.
Which makes me wonder, of all the women available to him, why did
Miller ask me out? Why did he kiss me?
“There's not much to tell.”
“Liar!” Stevie interjects. “You said—and I quote—‘Kissing Miller was
better than soaking in the tub with a slice of cake and a glass of wine after a
long day.' Said it was ‘better than sex with Jacob Karlsson, the guy from
college who had the nine-inch cock and could eat pussy like a pro.'”
“Stevie!” I hiss at her, my face flaming red, I'm sure.
“Oh my god.” Rosie doubles over in laughter, probably at the pure
shock that's etched across my face. “I was not expecting that from you at
all.”
“Because I didn't say that!”
Okay, fine. I totally did say that.
And I meant it too. Kissing Miller was better than sex with Jacob. Sure,
he had a big dick, but it didn't mean he knew how to use it. He truly was
incredible at oral, though.
But if Miller does anything half as well as he kisses, Jacob doesn't stand
a chance against him. Just having his hands wrapped around my waist…
feeling him against me…having his lips pressed tight against mine… It was
all so much better than anything I've ever had before, and that scares me.
He was worth an A+ and more.
“I still can't believe you said yes to a date with him,” Stevie says. “I
mean, kissing him is one thing, but dating? That's a whole different beast.”
“Sigh. Beast.” Rosie fans herself, thinking of Rhodes. “Why are all the
hockey players so damn hot?”
I don't know, but it's very distracting.
“It's just one date,” I mumble, but I know it's more than that.
It's going to be my first date in three years after losing my dad and my
long-term boyfriend all in one month. It's a huge step. I know it, and Stevie
does too.
“Besides, who knows if this is even going to become a thing? He could
take me out and realize he's way out of my league.”
“Or he could take you out and realize you're the love of his life.”
I snort out a laugh. “Right. Sure. We'll both keep dreaming about that
one.”
“Stop selling yourself short, Scout,” Stevie says with the big-sister
authority in her voice that I've come to know over the years. “Not just to
Miller, but to yourself too. You're a freaking catch, and any guy would be
lucky to have you.”
I give her a weak smile. “Thanks, but you have to say that.”
“Well, I don't.” Rosie waves her hand, then points to Stevie. “And I
happen to agree with her. Who knows what could happen with Miller, but
you can't write it off before you even try. I've done that before and totally
shot myself in the foot. Now the guy I was in love with is madly in love
with someone else. I blew my chance. Don't blow yours.”
I'm surprised by her statements and also so curious to know what
happened. I figure if she wanted to talk about it, she'd elaborate more, so I
let it go.
“Okay,” I say with a nod. “I'll give it a chance.”
“And if nothing else, you'll have some great inspiration for your book.”
Stevie shrugs.
Hmm. She does have a good point there. I was feeling very inspired
after Miller's kiss.
Maybe this could be good for my writing.
And…maybe for me too.
But I'm not going to get my hopes up. After all, this is Miller we're
talking about—no way he's about to fall in love with little old me.
When Miller told me to wear a dress and heels, I figured we'd be going out
to dinner.
What I didn't plan for was him taking me to the same place he's taken
all the other dates he's been photographed with.
It's safe to say the reason my stomach feels like it's doing flips is not
that I'm nervous—it's that I'm mad. I'm mad because there was a tiny part
of me that hoped Stevie was right, hoped things with Miller were different,
hoped maybe I was different.
But I'm just like all the rest…temporary.
I guess I know where I stand now.
“This place is nice, huh?” Miller says, reaching into the basket of bread
and holding a piece my way. I shake my head, and he shrugs, not picking up
on how clearly uncomfortable I am. “It's one of my favorites.”
Oh, I'm aware.
But I don't say that. Instead, I tell him, “It's nice.”
He scarfs down a piece of bread, then reaches for another.
I've yet to touch any or the glass of wine that's sitting in front of me,
which really says something because I love wine.
Silence falls over us, and it's not that comfortable, soothing kind.
It's awkward as hell. I know it, and Miller finally sees it too.
“Is, uh, something wrong?”
“Nope.”
Except even I hear in my voice that something is definitely wrong.
He sets his bread down, swallows what's in his mouth, then chugs half
his water. He reaches up and squeezes the back of his neck, massaging it for
several seconds.
I remember that move. It's his tell.
He's nervous.
Now that I think about it, he was nervous on the way over here too,
bouncing his leg as he drove entirely too fast. Hell, just sitting here now,
he's buttoned and unbuttoned his suit jacket three times.
Why is he so nervous?
After another heavy minute of silence, he finally blows out a breath,
then says, “I'm sorry. I shouldn't have brought you here.”
“Oh?”
He sighs. “I won't lie, I've been on a lot of dates since I joined the
Comets. It's kind of a thing I'm known for, being a serial dater.”
You don't say.
“But there's a reason for it. I've never told anyone this before. Well,
besides Greer, and I'm not so sure he really counts. I mean, he's Greer. He's
like the biggest asshole on the planet, but not really. That's just a front. I
think he got his heart broken once upon a time, and now he's working on
his villain origin story or something. He's…”
Miller's rambling. He's rambling because he's nervous. Why is he so
nervous? It's not like we haven't been out together before. Sure, this is a
little different because it's an actual, definite date, but it's still just me and
him.
This is a stall, and I'm tired of waiting.
“…he became our number one goalie last year and—”
“No offense, Miller, but I really don't care about Greer.”
He gives me a tight, shaky smile. “Right. Sorry.” He clears his throat.
“Look, the truth is I—”
“Is there anything else I can get you while you wait for your dinner?”
the waiter asks, choosing that exact moment to appear beside the table. He
gazes down at us with a saccharine smile. “Perhaps some more water, sir?”
Miller sets his now empty glass down, wiping his mouth with the back
of his hand. “More water would be great. Or something stronger. Vodka? A
big glass. On the rocks. No, wait—no rocks, just vodka. Lots of vodka.
Two, please.”
“Sure thing. Would you like some more bread? Maybe some of our
delicious butter and oils to dip it in? We have truffle oil, sweet garlic butter,
and extra virgin olive oil that's—”
“Virgin!”
I'm not the only person who whips my head Miller's way at his
outburst. No less than three tables in our vicinity turn, tuning in to our
conversation.
“Uh, sir?” our waiter asks, now looking deeply concerned.
And I don't blame him because What the fuck?
I'm trying to catch Miller's gaze, but he's refusing to look at me. All
he's doing is staring down at his plate, not looking at anyone.
“The olive oil, please,” he mutters.
“Right away, sir.” The waiter gives me a tight smile before walking
away, looking over his shoulder a few times and shaking his head.
Miller continues staring at his plate, and eventually, the onlookers get
tired of waiting for something else to happen and go back to their dinners.
“Miller?” I say quietly when he doesn't move for at least thirty seconds.
He sucks in a breath, then finally drags his eyes to mine. I've never seen
his cheeks so red before, which is saying something because he's done and
said plenty of embarrassing things in my presence.
But this is something else.
“Are you okay?” I ask gently.
“Virgin,” he says again, his tongue darting out to wet his lips. “I'm a
virgin, Scout.”
12
MILLER
Oh fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck.
This is it. We're done. Before we even had a chance to begin, Scout and
I are done.
Why the hell did I just blurt out virgin? What the hell is wrong with me?
She's just staring at me with her jaw dropped, her eyes wide. She's
thinking of bolting. I can see it. She probably thinks something is wrong
with me or that I'm a total loser or—
“Okay.”
I rear back because there is no way she just said what I think she said.
“Huh?”
“I said, okay. Is that not what you want me to say?”
“No. I…”
Well, shit. I actually don't know what I want her to say. Do I want her to
be okay with this? Yes, because it's not a big deal to me. But do I just want
her to say okay…? I don't know. I think really, I just want to know what
she's thinking about.
I sit up higher in my chair, leaning over the table and keeping my voice
low. “Does it bother you?”
She shakes her head. “Not one bit. Should it?”
“I guess not, no.”
“Are you telling me because you want me to take your virginity?”
Fucking hell.
My face is on fire. I can feel the flames licking at my cheeks, can feel
the sweat beginning to bead.
Scout take my virginity?
Well, I definitely don't hate the idea of that.
She laughs. “I'm kidding.”
“But what if I did?”
All the humor drains from her face, and she looks just as surprised as I
am by my words.
Do I mean them? Is that what I want? I don't know.
“I mean, I'm not saying no…”
She giggles. “Then I won't say no either.”
“Okay.”
I settle back in my seat, reaching for my glass of water, only to
remember at the last minute that it's empty. My nerves are shot, and my
throat feels like I swallowed an entire box of nails. I'm pretty sure if I stood
right now, my legs would give out.
Where the hell is the waiter? I'm sure I scared him off by screaming
virgin at him, but I need a drink—stat.
Silence engulfs us. All Scout can do is stare at me, and all I can do is
look anywhere but at her.
This dinner is awful. I ruined everything.
God, I'm such an idiot.
When I finally peek up, Scout's head is tipped to the side, and she's
watching me closely. A piece of hair has fallen loose from the braid that's
lying over her shoulder, and I want to reach across the table and pull it
between my fingers to see if it's as soft as it looks. I want to drag her closer
to me and kiss her, or just sit with her and talk for hours.
What I definitely don't want is to sit in this damn restaurant for another
minute.
Screw the drink. Screw the dinner. Screw this place.
“Do you want to get out of here?”
She nods enthusiastically. “Yes. Please.”
“Good. I know just the place.”
My chair scrapes loudly across the floor as I stand, drawing several eyes
our way. It's the same people whose stares I felt earlier, and I can't say I'm
bothered by them.
The waiter appears with my vodkas. I grab the glasses off his tray and
set them on the table next to us.
“For your troubles,” I tell the women who I heard mention were on their
first date. “I hope it goes better than the one I'm on.”
They both laugh, then pick the glasses up and clink them together
before throwing them back in one gulp.
“We're leaving,” I tell the waiter, digging my wallet from my back
pocket and plucking out three one-hundred-dollar bills. I toss them onto his
tray. “This should cover our bill.”
His wide eyes land on the pile of cash, and all he can do is nod because
that covers our dinner and then some.
“Thank you, sir. I hope you have a lovely evening.”
He turns on his heel and walks away.
I look down at Scout, who is watching me with an amused grin, and
extend my hand toward her.
“You ready?”
She slips her hand into mine. “Lead the way.”
We pull into the parking lot of the gas station.
“Is this the place you know?”
“Nah. We're just here for snacks. I'm sure you're probably hungry since
we didn't eat dinner, and I nervous-ate all the bread.”
“Yes! I'm starving.”
She throws the door open before I can tell her to wait, but I'm not
surprised by it anymore. Scout's going to do what Scout's going to do,
which is why I like her so much.
She's just…Scout.
She's entirely her own person, doing her own thing. She doesn't put on
a front or pretend to be someone she isn't just so people will like her more.
After growing up in the world I did with the parents I had where all they did
was pretend, it's nice to have someone real.
I shuffle past her, at least holding this door open for her.
“Drinks or snacks first?”
“Snacks. Drink always depends on snack. You have to make sure they
pair well together.”
“Hm. I like the way you think.”
We head for the snack aisle. She instantly grabs a packet of Reese's
Pieces, snags peanut butter M&M'S next, and then selects a packet of Sour
Skittles and some sour gummies.
“That's quite the jump,” I comment.
“The Skittles and gummies are for me, the rest for you.”
“For me?”
She nods. “You love peanut butter, right? That's why you always get the
Chocolate Nutty Butter.”
I don't know why I'm surprised she's caught on that I have a weird love
affair with peanut butter, but I like that she noticed. “I fucking love peanut
butter.”
She grins. “I figured. Which means your drink is…” She leads us to the
cooler section, perusing them until she finds just what she's looking for. She
pops the door open, reaches in, and hands me a glass bottle. “A Yoo-hoo.”
“A Yoo-hoo, huh?”
“Yep.”
I grab the bottle, reading the label. “So, it's chocolate water?” My nose
scrunches up. “Yeah, I don't know about that. Can't I just have chocolate
milk instead?”
“Wait a minute—you've never had a Yoo-hoo before?”
I shake my head. “No. I wasn't really allowed sweets as a kid. It didn't
fit in with my hockey routine.”
Her jaw drops, and I slip a finger under her chin, pushing it back up.
“I can't believe you're twenty-four and have never had a Yoo-hoo.”
“I've never had sex either.”
“Miller!” A laugh bursts out of her, drawing the attention of the two
other people in the store, but she doesn't care, and screw it—I don't care
either.
I shrug. “It's true.”
“I know.” She closes the cooler, then moves down two more before
swinging the door open and plucking out a root beer. It's the same thing she
ordered when we had pizza. I wonder if it's her favorite and she would have
gotten it no matter what snacks she picked.
“Is that all? We're just having candy?”
She screws her face up. “No. This is just our appetizer.” She dips her
head toward the island in the middle of the store. “We're having nachos.”
So, we make nachos. At a freaking gas station. It's safe to say this date
has definitely gone in a different direction than I originally planned.
We take our items to the register, where she adds two scratch-off lottery
tickets to our pile.
Candy, nachos, and drinks in hand, we slip back into the car. Scout
reaches over and turns on the radio as I pull out of the parking lot. I can't
help but laugh at what's on and turn the Taylor Swift song up to full blast.
I head east, knowing just where I want to take us. Five minutes later,
we're pulling into the parking lot of an old, run-down drive-in theater.
“What are we doing here? Didn't this place close a few years back?”
I don't answer her as I park the car in the middle of the lot directly in
front of the old screen that's still up. There's a tear down the center,
probably from some local high schoolers, and weeds almost as tall as the
front of the car are sticking up out of the cracks in the pavement.
“I can't believe how much it's changed in two years. It's like the theater
never even existed.”
“You used to come here?”
I nod. “Back when I first joined the Comets, yeah. Only made it a few
times before it shut down, but I always loved it.”
She looks out at the vacant lot, a wistful look in her eye. “I used to
come here with my dads all the time. Sundays were family days, which
usually meant a movie or bowling. Stevie would always pick bowling, but I
always wanted to go to the movies.” She looks over at me with a smile.
“For the stories, of course. Pops loved it too.”
“Tell me a story, then.”
“What? No way.”
“Yes way.” I point to the bag sitting at her feet. “But first, hand me that
bag. I need my snacks for this.”
“I'm not telling you a story,” she says, but she hands me the bag
anyway. I fish out my peanut butter treats along with my Yoo-hoo, then
drop her sour candies onto the center console and set her root beer in the
cup holder.
I open my mouth.
“Umm…” she says, staring at me.
“Nacho me.”
“I am not feeding you, Miller.”
“How rude.” I pluck a chip from the plastic container, then another for
good measure. “This is going to be awful with my chocolate water.”
“Oh, disgusting for sure.” She pops a chip into her mouth, moaning as
she chews. “How is it something so cheap and what should be absolutely
awful tastes so good?”
I shrug. “It's the way of life, I guess.”
“I suppose.”
I rip open my M&M'S, tossing a handful back. They taste terrible with
the cheese from the nachos. I twist open the Yoo-hoo and take a tentative
sip.
“Well?” she asks.
“It's not…bad. But it's not great either.”
“Just wait. You're going to be addicted to them.”
“We'll see.” I take another drink, already liking it more. I cap the bottle,
then set it back in the cup holder. “Enough stalling. Story time.”
“You can't be serious.”
“Oh, I am. You're a writer, aren't you? A storyteller?”
“Yes. No. I mean, I want to be.”
“So, tell me a story, then.”
“Miller…this is so embarrassing.”
“More embarrassing than me yelling virgin in the middle of a restaurant
where the average plate costs a hundred bucks?”
“Mine was only forty,” she mumbles. “I ordered a salad.”
“And you're still stalling.”
“I totally am.” She sighs. “All right, fine. Once upon a time…”
I push my seat back and settle down into my seat as she launches into a
fairy tale about an American high schooler who finds out she's royalty. She
gets sent to a foreign country to learn how to be part of the aristocracy, and
at first, it's a disaster, but in the end, she winds up winning the hearts of
everyone around her.
The way she tells it…it's enchanting, and I can't look away from her.
The details are astounding, making it feel like I've been transported to this
magical country and I'm the fucking princess.
By the time she's finished, I've eaten all of my M&M'S and half my
bag of Reese's Pieces, and my chocolate water—which I admittedly love—
is gone. I'm so invested that when she says The End, there are actual tears
in my eyes—not that I'd ever admit that shit out loud.
“Wow. That was…incredible. Is that something you wrote?”
She cocks her head to the side, wrinkling her nose. “No, Miller. That's
the plot of The Princess Diaries.”
“Wait…so it's already a book?”
“Well, yes, but it's also a Disney movie. Have you never seen it?”
“Can't say I have.”
“I was wondering why you just let me keep going. Your face when you
found out she went down the stairs on a mattress was priceless.”
“Because she's a princess!”
She tosses her head back in laughter, her entire body shaking. I don't
even care that she's making fun of me right now. I love seeing her like this,
so carefree and relaxed.
After several moments, she wipes at her eyes, exhaling sharply. “Wow. I
needed that laugh.”
“Long week?”
“Weird week.” She nibbles at her bottom lip. “It was strange not having
you around. It threw me off.”
I grin. “I knew you liked me.”
She rolls her eyes. “You wish.”
“I do. Like you, I mean.”
She peers over at me. “You do?”
“Yes. Very much.”
The moonlight is bright enough that I don't miss the way her cheeks
pinken at my admission.
“You're not what I was expecting, Miller.”
“The virgin thing?”
Her eyes widen for a brief moment. “Well, that too. Can we…talk about
that?”
“What's there to discuss?”
“Everything! Was I your first kiss?”
I laugh lightly. “No. That would be Abby Albertson in the eighth grade.”
“Well, that's a relief, I guess. And…other stuff?”
“Are you asking me about my sexual history, Scout?”
“No!” Another deep blush. “Well, sort of, I suppose.”
“I've done things, just not everything.”
“I haven't done everything either. Like butt stuff—I haven't done that.”
What she's just blurted out hits her, and she sinks lower into her seat,
covering her face with her hands. “Oh god. Kill me now.”
“Nah. I kind of like you.” I reach over, pulling her hands down. I grab
her chin, tilting it my way. “I want to keep you around.”
“You do?”
“Yeah. Do you still want to keep me around? With the virgin thing, I
mean.”
“Of course! It doesn't bother me at all. I'm just curious how.”
“It's really the lamest answer of all time.”
“Try me.”
“Hockey.”
“Huh?”
“Hockey.” I lift my shoulders. “I was playing hockey. It was my life.
Everything was about the game. I didn't do any of the normal teenage stuff
because I wasn't allowed to. The only thing that mattered was making it
pro, and after I did, it was about making it last.” I swallow down the
frustration that's settling into my stomach. “The longer it went on, though,
the harder it became, and then I didn't want it to be with someone random.
I…I wanted it to matter. I still want it to matter.”
Now it's my face that's turning red because it's embarrassing. Guys
aren't supposed to care about who they have sex with. It's socially
acceptable for us to just bang and not give a crap, but that's not who I am or
how I'm wired. And I'm finally starting to accept that.
She gives me a small smile. “That's not lame, Miller. It's unexpectedly
sweet.”
“Yeah? You don't think I'm a total loser?”
“Not at all. I think you're the exact opposite of that.”
Relief floods me because her words seem genuine, and I like having
genuine people in my life.
“Have, uh, have you really never told anyone before?”
I shake my head. “Just Greer. There's never really been anyone I've
trusted.”
“But you trust me?”
I nod. “I do. Do you trust me?”
It's her turn to nod. “I do.”
“Good.”
Then, I claim her mouth with mine.
She lets out a soft gasp, but it quickly turns into a low moan when my
lips press against hers. I grip her waist, tugging her as close as I can in the
confined space. Her hands find my hair, doing the same. This kiss is
different from our last. It's rougher and faster, more desperate, like we've
both been dying for it since the moment our lips last touched.
I wish we weren't in my car so I could properly feel her against me, so I
could rake my hands over her whole body and touch every damn curve she
has. She groans against my mouth like she's just as frustrated as I am by our
lack of room to maneuver.
I might not be able to haul her into my lap, but that doesn't mean I can't
touch her. I slide my hand from her waist and over her stomach. I feel her
tense for only a moment when I do this, but she relaxes when she realizes
my destination is much lower.
When my fingers collide with her bare thighs, I'm so damn thankful
she's wearing a dress. She's warm and soft, and I have a feeling being
between her legs would feel like heaven.
I snake my hand under her dress, fingering the hem of the silky
material. Her legs fall apart like she's giving me permission to continue,
and I don't hesitate to seize the opportunity. She sighs when I drag a single
knuckle against her already soaked panties. She arches into my touch,
wanting more when I run my fingertip over the edge of them. And then,
when I finally slip my finger underneath the material, she gasps.
“Please…” she whispers against my lips.
“Please what, Scout? What do you want?”
“Touch me.” It's not a request, not really. It's a demand—one I am more
than happy to oblige.
I slide one finger over her clit, and she shivers. I do it again. Another
shiver. This time a moan.
I tease and tease, knowing exactly what I'm doing when she's panting in
my ear.
“Grady…”
My name rolling off her lips drives me mad, and I can't hold back any
longer. I slant my mouth over hers just as I slide a finger into her, stroking
her softly and slowly as I continue to brush my thumb against her clit.
She groans when I slide my finger out, only for it to turn into a low
whimper when I dive back in with two, curling them up and finding the spot
that has her bucking her hips off the seat.
She grips my forearm, holding me to her as she grinds against me. She's
fucking my fingers now, riding the wave that's coursing through her.
“Oh god… I'm…” She cries out as she falls apart, gasping for air.
Tremors run through her body, and her nails dig into me, so rough I'm
sure there will be a mark tomorrow, but I don't care. I've never witnessed
anything so damn sexy before as she falls apart in my arms.
I kiss her again, trailing my lips from hers and across her jaw, down her
neck, and back up again until I reach her mouth once more, placing one
final kiss there before pulling away.
She slumps back against her seat, looking absolutely drained in the best
of ways. Her hair is a wreck, and there's a sheen of sweat across her
forehead.
I can't help but laugh.
“What?” she asks, sounding so damn tired.
“Nothing. You just look adorable right now.”
She scrunches her nose. “Adorable? I'm not sure anyone has ever called
me that before.”
“Well, they should, because it's true.”
She lets out a soft yawn, covering her mouth with her hand. “Sorry.”
“Don't apologize. I've clearly worn you out.”
“And we didn't even have sex. Impressive.”
“Does this mean I've earned myself an A-plus yet?”
“Not quite.”
“Damn. I'll just have to try again on the second date.”
She lifts her brows. “Second date, huh?”
“Or the third.” I shrug. “I'm willing to go as many times as needed for a
perfect grade.”
“Don't go getting too ahead of yourself.” She pats my cheeks. “Let's see
how date two goes first.”
I've never looked forward to a second date so much in my life.

MILLER & SCOUT
Miller: I got a boner in the shower tonight.
Scout: That's…information I wasn't aware I needed.
Miller: Well, it's your fault, so that's why I thought you needed
to know.
Scout: How is it my fault? You're hundreds of miles away!
Miller: Yeah, but I can't stop thinking about you and what
happened in my car the other night.
Scout: Oh.
Miller: Yeah, oh.
Miller: It's very inconvenient, too. You're not supposed to get
boners in the shower. That's like the number one locker room
rule.
Scout: I'm sorry?
Miller: You should be. It's rude.
Miller: But it was totally worth it.
Miller: Is it inappropriate if I say I can't wait to do it again?
Scout: You literally just texted me about your boner. I think
we're past inappropriate at this point.
Miller: That's fair.
Miller: Was that too much? I've been told I overshare
sometimes.
Scout: No. It made me laugh, which I needed today.
Miller: Uh-oh. Bad day?
Scout: Just tired. I didn't get much sleep last night then had a
cranky customer this morning that made me cranky.
Miller: Punch 'em in the nuts next time.
Scout: It was a lady.
Miller: Then punch her in the balls. Clearly, she's got 'em if
she's getting sassy with you. You're kind of scary.
Scout: Oh?
Miller: Yeah. But it's in a hot way.
Scout: There's a hot way to be scary?
Miller: Of course there is.
Miller: There's like this fine line between scary and hot, which
gives you scary hot.
Scout: No, right. That makes total sense.
Miller: It's not crazy.
Scout: I didn't say it was.
Miller: You have this…tone.
Scout: It's text. Can you really tell a tone in text?
Miller: YES!
Miller: ^That was exasperation.
Scout: Noted.
Miller: Do you miss me yet?
Scout: Not a chance.
Miller: Whatever you have to tell yourself, Scout.
Scout: *rolls eyes*
Scout: Go play hockey, Miller.
Scout: I thought you'd like to know that Macie was quite proud
of your goal last night. She talked about it all throughout
breakfast this morning.
Miller: She's proud of it? I'M proud of it! That was a fucking
wicked shot!
Scout: There's that modesty you're known for.
Miller: Hey, someone's gotta toot my horn.
Scout: That…sounded oddly sexual.
Miller: I mean, it wasn't, but I like where your head is at.
Miller: Is this the start of phone sex?
Scout: WHAT? No! That's not at all what I meant!
Miller: Are you sure?
Scout: Very, very sure.
Miller: Boo!
Miller: But I respect your decision and will not pressure you.
Scout: Such a gentleman.
Miller: I do my best.
Miller: Any ideas for our second date tomorrow?
Scout: Nope. I'm not planning it. It's all on you.
Miller: Well, I have some ideas.
Miller: Naked ideas.
Miller: *waggles brows*
Scout: How did I know that was coming?
Miller: Because I'm me and whether you want to admit it or
not, you like me and pay attention to me.
Scout: That's a stretch.
Miller: You liked me in my car when I had my fingers between
your legs.
Scout: Can't stop thinking about it?
Miller: Can you?
Scout: No.
Miller: Are you blushing right now?
Scout: A little.
Miller: I like it when you blush.
Miller: I especially like it when I'm the one to make you blush.
Scout: I've picked up on that.
Miller: Just think, I've been holding back too. Wait until you
get to know me even better.
Scout: That kind of scares me a bit, I won't lie.
Miller: Nothing to fear.
Miller: Well…there's that one thing.
Scout: What one thing?
Scout: Miller?
Scout: MILLER?
Scout: What one thing????
Scout: Oh. You're screwing with me, aren't you?
Miller: Guess you'll have to find out later.
Scout: You're so annoying.
Miller: You love it.
Scout: That's one way to describe it.
Miller: Tomorrow at four?
Scout: You know where to find me.

SCOUT
Miller's fingers must be magic because in the last week since our date, I've
written ten chapters.
And I haven't deleted a single one.
It's safe to say at this point he's my muse. After we kissed for the first
time, I wrote. After the other night in his car, I really wrote. I can't stop
thinking about my book, and the urge to write has never been stronger. I
know it's all because of Miller and the way being with him makes me feel
—alive.
He hasn't been around in three days thanks to the season starting, but
we're still texting all the time. We haven't yet gotten a chance to go on our
second date—that's tonight—and I am more than looking forward to it.
I've never really been one to fool around on the first date, but when
Miller slid his fingers up my legs, it was like my body just knew what it
wanted—him. And oh, man, was it right. I still can't shake the feeling of
him between my thighs, can't get over the way I fell apart around him. The
way he stroked me gently and kissed me so damn tenderly while I came
down from my high…
He might be a virgin, but he's no fool. He knows exactly what he's
doing.
To say I was shocked when he confessed his virginity to me would be
an understatement. That was the absolute last thing I thought he was going
to say. It doesn't seem real. How can he be twenty-four, a professional
hockey player, and a virgin? Women throw themselves at him constantly.
I've seen it with my own eyes, for crying out loud!
When he told me his reasoning, part of me felt bad for him because it's
obvious he struggles with missing out on so many “normal” things because
of his dedication to hockey. I mean, he's glad it all paid off, but I can see
where that could be hard sometimes. He'd never even had a Yoo-hoo until
the other night at the drive-in.
That was another surprise—there was no way he could have known
what that place meant to me when he pulled into the abandoned lot, which
made it all that much sweeter that he chose it.
I used to love the drive-in for my own reasons, but now…now I love it
for others.
I clench my thighs together for probably the fifth time today.
“Aunt Scout! Miller is here!” Macie calls from the common area, which
she and Stevie are currently cleaning up.
“What?!”
I poke my head out of the truck window, and sure enough, Miller is
here.
Well, not technically here here.
He's currently across the street, sitting up on a stone ledge. Next to him
is Eddie, who is waving his hands in the air, talking fast. He must be telling
some story because Miller has his head thrown back in laughter. They look
like two old friends catching up.
A smile overtakes my face at the sight of them together.
Most people would turn their nose up at Eddie. Hell, I've witnessed
assholes driving by and yelling obscenities out their windows at him, some
truly vile things.
Then you have Miller, a hotshot hockey player taking five minutes out
of his busy day to treat this man like the human being he is.
I'm so glad he's not an asshole.
Almost as if he can sense I'm thinking about him, he turns his head and
looks my way.
I see the grin that fills his face, and he elbows Eddie, then nods toward
me. Eddie turns his attention in my direction, then says something to Miller.
I wish like hell I could read lips from this far away because his grin grows
wider as he nods, agreeing with whatever Eddie said to him.
Miller pats Eddie on the back and gets up, heading toward the truck.
I busy myself with work as he saunters—and I really do mean saunters
—over. I may act like I'm not paying him any attention, but from the smirk
on his face, he knows I am very much tuned in to what he's doing.
He sends a wave to Macie and Stevie as he makes his way up to the
window.
“Hey,” he says casually when he reaches the truck.
“Um, hi. Did I get the time of our date wrong?” I ask.
“Nope. We're still on for four. I was just coming by to see Eddie.”
“Do you hang out with him often?”
I've seen Miller talking with him several times over the years. He
always buys him donuts and coffee, and they sit on the wall or along the
sidewalk.
“I try to stop and see him at least weekly, sometimes more often if I can
find him. He moves around to a few different places, but since I come here
so often, I try to check up on him here.”
“How'd you meet him?”
He lifts a shoulder. “He was here. I was here. We just started talking.
We've been friends since. I've tried to get him off the streets a few times,
but he refuses, and I'm not going to push it. But during the winter, when it
gets cold, I make him at least let me pay for a hotel so he can warm up.”
“That's sweet of you, Miller.”
His brows furrow. “It's not sweet. It's basic human decency.”
“Trust me, not every person is decent like that. The things I've heard
people say to him…”
His face darkens. “Let me catch one asshole saying shit to him. Wright
won't be the only one to get arrested on our team.”
“Oh my gosh. I almost forgot about that.”
It happened just a few weeks after the Comets lost in the Finals in one
of the worst ways ever. It was all over the news, and people were worried
Wright was going to get shipped to a different team, but he didn't. He
stayed and came back better than ever the following year.
“Need any help cleaning up?” he asks, looking around at the mess I'm
still working on.
Sundays are always our busiest days, and this one was no exception.
The line was out of the parking lot at one point, and it just seemed to get
bigger and bigger. I'm about eighty percent sure it's because we brought
back the Comets Cosmic Brownie donut for the start of the season, and fans
were hoping a player would be here. I wanted to ask Miller to stop by, but
given how much we've been hanging out lately, it felt weird cashing in a
favor like that.
“I think I'm about done. Macie and Stevie are working on the tables
now, and I'm almost finished in here. I was going to run home and clean up
first. I most definitely need a shower.”
“Or…” he says. “You can shower at my place.”
I lift my brows. “Your place?”
He nods. “I was thinking maybe I can make you dinner.”
I was not expecting that. “You cook?”
“A little. Not much.” He blows out a breath. “All right, fine. I was going
to boil noodles, throw some jar sauce on top, and call it good.”
I wrinkle my nose. “No. That will not do. How about I cook, and you
can make a salad?”
“I feel like that's not fair. You've been working all day.”
“I don't mind. It'll be a nice break from making sweets.”
“We can run by the store after you're done here and grab ingredients if
you want? We can stop by your place and grab clothes for tomorrow.”
He says it so causally like he didn't just skip over the many hours we
still have left in the day.
Does this mean…
“I've never had a slumber party either,” he says. “Figured since we're
checking some things off my list, like Yoo-hoos, maybe try that one too.
Plus, I'm leaving for an extended away trip soon. If you stay over, we could
maybe even get a third date in before I go.”
I feel like it should scare me, like I shouldn't be staying at his place so
soon. I wait for the little voice in my head that says it's a bad idea and we
should take it slow.
But it never comes.
I'm not sure how I feel about it, but before I can analyze it, Stevie says,
“She'll stay!”
“Stevie!” I yell at her.
“What?” She shrugs. “I've totally been listening in the whole time. You
should stay at his place.” She looks at Miller. “And it's really weird that
you've never had a Yoo-hoo before.”
“Don't judge.”
“And stop listening in!” I add.
She walks away with her hands in the air like she's innocent when we
all know she's far from it. She's probably just going somewhere else to hide
and listen.
Miller looks back at me. “Don't let her pressure you. If you don't want
to stay over, you don't have to. It's not like I'm expecting anything, if you
catch my drift.”
I do catch it, and I appreciate it. But…I actually think I'd be okay if
something did happen. I didn't realize how dormant I've felt in the last
three years, and now that I've had an orgasm that didn't come from my
vibrator, I want more.
“I can do a slumber party,” I tell him.
“Yeah?” I nod. “Cool.” He leans closer. “And, Scout?”
I inch forward. “Yes?”
“Maybe don't pack any pajamas.”
He shoves off the truck, spinning away and leaving me there with my
mouth hanging open.
Stevie holds her hand up for a high five. “Nice.”
He smirks…and taps his hand to hers.
For what feels like the hundredth time, I wonder what I've gotten
myself into with Miller…and why I'm so excited about it.
“Do you want cheese on the garlic bread?”
“Yes, please.”
I nod, grabbing a tub of grated parmesan. Normally I'd grate it myself,
but I have no idea what kind of supplies Miller has at his place.
We look ridiculous walking through the store together right now. I'm
still wearing my trusty overalls, and my hair is a chaotic mess. He's my
exact opposite—put together in jeans and a nice t-shirt that looks entirely
too soft and still has fold marks on it.
“Do you have extra virgin olive oil at home?”
“Among other types of virgins, yes.”
“Miller!” I hiss.
“What? I meant you and butt stuff.”
I shake my head, steering the cart toward the next item on our list.
When we get to the aisle with the tomato paste, I'm annoyed it's on the
top shelf. Why do they have to put things so high?
I rise up on my tiptoes and reach for the jar, but I don't make it very far
before Miller is there behind me. One hand goes to my waist, and his
warmth washes over me as he reaches around, grabbing the jar with ease.
My ass is lined up with his cock, and I don't miss the way he presses
against me, making sure I feel every single inch of him.
Two can play that game.
I grind against him, adding friction to the fire he's trying to ignite.
He groans, and a deep growl moves through him. “Woman.”
I laugh, ducking under his arm and squeezing around him. “What?”
“You're mean.”
“Oh, I'm mean? You know exactly what you were just doing.”
“Reaching for the jar you needed?”
“Uh-huh.” I glance down at the bulge that's not so hidden in his jeans.
“You know what they say, Miller: play stupid games, win stupid prizes.”
“Oh, I have a prize for you…”
I let out a loud squeak as he stalks toward me with a spark in his eyes
that's pure desire.
He doesn't stop until he has me pressed against the cart. He places his
hands on it, caging me in like he's a predator and I'm his prey.
“I hope you know that once we get home, this game will continue…and
you will lose.”
“Is it really losing if I'm satisfied in the end?” I challenge with a lifted
brow.
He narrows his eyes. “Who said I'm going to let you come?”
“I saw the look in your eye the other night, and I think you enjoyed your
fingers between my legs as much as I did.”
He knows I have him there. “You—”
“Hey, you creep! You leave that young woman alone!”
Miller whirls around, and I peek around him to find an old woman
pointing a finger at us.
“I'm not—”
“OH MY GOD, HIS PENIS!”
Miller rushes toward her. “Ma'am! I—”
“Security! Security! He's trying to touch me with his penis!”
Then, the old woman starts screaming, and that's when all hell breaks
loose.
“I can't believe she hit you, or that you went down.”
“I can't believe she called security on me. I'm the one who was
assaulted!”
“Well, you did point your boner directly at her…”
“A boner that was your fault!” He winces when I remove the ice pack
from his face. There's a cut from the metal spikes on her purse and a pretty
dark bruise has formed, but it's nothing too serious. “What the hell did she
even have in her bag? That thing was heavy as hell.”
“I'm pretty sure it was full of bingo daubers. I counted like twenty
while we waited for management to sort it out.”
“Seriously?”
I nod. “Seriously. And then she asked for your autograph after all of
that.”
He shakes his head. “I'm just glad nobody called the police.”
“She threatened to.”
“I didn't even do anything!”
He rises off his stool as he says this, but I shove him back down.
“I know,” I say. “They know too. We got it all settled.”
He groans. “God, Coach is going to flip when he hears about this
tomorrow. And all the guys are going to laugh.”
I giggle because it's hilarious when you think about it. Miller doesn't
appreciate it, sending a stern glare my way, which in turn makes me laugh
harder.
Eventually he cracks, and we're both laughing.
“You know,” he says once we've settled down, “we're really not having
a good track record with dates. The first one I…”
“Ruined it by screaming at the waiter about your virginity, and the
second…”
“I ruined with my virgin wiener.”
That sends us into another fit of laughter.
“I think I'm most upset we ended up leaving the store empty-handed
because I was really looking forward to our dinner,” Miller says.
“It's fine. We'll do it another night. Besides, I was kind of craving pizza
anyway.”
“I think we needed something easy after that chaos. It should be here in
about ten minutes if you want to go shower.”
“Are you sure?” I ask, even though I really do want to wash up. I'm still
a mess from working in the truck all day.
“Yeah,” he says, taking the ice pack from my hands. “I'll be fine. My
bedroom is down at the end of the hall. The bathroom is kind of hard to
miss from there. I'll give you the grand tour after we eat.”
“If you insist…” I hop off the stool and start heading that way, then
realize my mistake. “Oh crap! We forgot to stop by my place for clothes.
Now our slumber party is ruined.”
“No. No way. We've already had enough things get ruined—this one
won't be one of them. I'll find you something to wear.”
I laugh. “Yeah, right. Your clothes aren't going to fit me, Miller.”
He narrows his eyes. “I'll find you something and set it on the bathroom
counter.”
I want to argue because there is just no way he's going to find anything
that'll cover everything, but he's already had a hard enough evening, so I
don't.
“Okay. I'll be quick,” I promise, heading off down the hall.
Miller lives in one of the big, swanky buildings downtown that
overlooks the city, and his place is massive. Stevie and I could easily fit our
entire apartment inside of his living room. I'm dying to peek around in
every room, but I don't want to be nosy. I can't help myself when I get to
his bedroom, though. I have to look around.
I don't know why, but to me, Miller always screamed a messy-frat-guy
apartment. That's not the case at all. It's neat and tidy, and even his bed is
made to perfection. I wonder if he has a cleaner come in or if he's just this
organized himself.
There aren't any knickknacks lying around, just a book on the side
table. I peek at the cover and burst out laughing when I see what he's
reading: The Princess Diaries by Meg Cabot.
Of course that's what he's reading.
I set the book back down, then make my way into his bathroom. It's the
same monochromatic scheme as the rest of the house, but the real beauty of
the space is the massive walk-in shower. There's no door; you just walk
right in, and there's a frosted glass window so you're not completely boxed
in. Deep gray stonework covers every inch, and there's a black bench
tucked in the back. It's easily the most gorgeous bathroom I've ever seen in
person.
I strip, setting my dirty clothes near his hamper, then I turn on the water
to let it heat up. Water spurts out from two different directions, and I giggle
with glee because I already know this is going to be the best shower of my
life.
Once the water is warmed up—which takes all of twenty seconds—I
step inside and literally groan with relief when the heat rushes over me.
I stand under the streams for several minutes before I even consider
doing anything else. There's not much in the way of products in here—
though that's not surprising—so I make do with what I have. I apologize to
my hair for having to use the 2-in-1, then squirt some of his woodsyscented body wash into my hands.
I freeze when I hear the door creak open and then remember it's just
Miller bringing me clothes, and I relax. I know he can't really see, just the
outline, but I can still feel his eyes on me. My immediate reaction is to be
embarrassed by this, but I can't bring myself to actually feel that way, not
when I can feel his stare dancing along my body as I rinse the soap away.
There's a part of me that wants to invite him into the shower, wants to
haul him to me and kiss him senseless…but I'm not sure I'm ready for that
quite yet.
Based on the fact that the soap is long gone by the time he makes the
decision to leave the bathroom, he's thinking about it too.
Once he's gone, I shut the water off and grab the nearest towel to dry
off.
“Oh god.” I moan, slipping it around my body. “Even the freaking
towels are amazing.”
I notice my dirty clothes are gone, and sitting on the counter are the
replacements.
I laugh when I pick them up. “He's insane. This won't fit.”
I'm proven wrong when I pull the shirt over my body, and not only does
it fit, but there's also still room. It hits mid-thigh, which is good because I
have no underwear and the pair of shorts Miller left won't fit.
I run my fingers through my wet hair, fluffing it up a bit so I don't go
out there looking like a drowned rat.
I look at myself in the mirror. I'm wearing a shirt that's just big enough
to cover me, but if I lift my arms at all, all my goodies are going to hang
out, and I look ridiculous with my wet hair. This is the best I can do given
the situation, though.
The situation is I'm staying the night with Grady Miller.
Oh god. What the hell has my life turned into over the last month and a
half? I went from working constantly and holing up at home when I had
time off to having a sleepover with a hockey player.
Stevie said I needed writing inspiration, and this is some top-tier stuff.
Maybe after whatever this is with Miller runs its course, I'll finally have a
finished book.
A faint knock at the front door pulls me from my thoughts, and right on
cue, my stomach growls because it knows it's pizza time.
With one last glance at myself, deciding there's not much else I can do,
I take a deep breath and set out to find Miller.
15
MILLER
I'm fucked.
Not literally—though I wish.
But I'm totally screwed.
When I set clothes on the counter for her, I expected her to march out
here in a towel and tell me she wasn't going to wear it. I didn't expect her to
put it on, but now she's standing before me wearing the Comets logo across
her chest with my name and number across her back.
It's hot as fuck.
“Thanks for the t-shirt,” she says, yanking it down lower when it rides
up a bit as she pads farther into the kitchen.
“T-shirt? You're killing me, woman. It's a jersey, or even a sweater—but
definitely not a t-shirt.”
“That's the second time you've called me that today.”
I tip my head, unsure what she's meaning.
“Woman,” she clarifies. “You said it in the grocery store too.”
“Oh. Do you not like it?”
“Honestly, I didn't think I would, but…you keep growling it. It's kind
of hot.”
“I growl?”
“Yeah.” She nods. “Like…woman.”
She drops her voice a few octaves, really pushing the word out from her
chest, and I can't help but laugh.
“There's no way I sound like that.”
“You do.” She shrugs. “But it's okay because it's hot.”
“Is it?”
“Oh yeah. Sometimes guys do that in romance novels, and I've always
wondered what it meant and why it gets the heroine all hot and bothered,
but then you…” She waves her hand toward me. “Yeah.”
“Are you saying you're all hot and bothered right now?”
Pink colors her cheeks. “Well, I'm not not hot and bothered. It doesn't
help that you stole my bra, and this jersey feels really good against my
nipples.” She slaps her hand over her mouth. “Oh my god. Forget I said
that.”
Oh, I cannot forget she said that. Not in a million years will I forget she
said that.
Fuck. Just thinking about her nipples makes my dick throb.
To be fair, everything about Scout makes my dick throb. She just has
this effortless sexiness about her that I find incredibly attractive.
“Please?” she asks, eyes still wide.
“Not a chance.”
Before I know it, I'm crossing the kitchen and scooping her into my
arms.
“Miller!” She squeals out a surprised laugh. “What the—put me down!”
“Fine,” I say, placing her on the counter, just where I wanted her all
along.
“You're insane,” she says breathlessly as I step in between her legs.
“Maybe a little.” I nuzzle my face into her neck, kissing her softly.
She's trembling in my arms—literally.
“Are you okay?” I ask.
“The counter is cold against my ass.”
I pull my head back and look at her. “Against your…” It all clicks into
place. “You're not wearing any underwear, are you?”
She sinks her teeth into her bottom lip, shaking her head just a little.
Even I hear the growl that leaves me this time.
I slide my eyes down her body and see that the jersey has ridden up into
very dangerous territory. It's covering just the tippy tops of her thighs now.
If she were to move even just an inch, it wouldn't be covering anything at
all.
I really want her to move an inch.
I meet her gaze, and I'm not surprised to find she's staring at me with
the same look that's probably in my eyes—unabashed need.
“Can I…see?”
A soft exhale leaves her lips, and she hesitates for only a moment before
nodding softly. “Yes.”
I don't waste a single second, don't give her any room to change her
mind. I place my hands on her knees and spread them apart.
I was right about Scout—she's stunning.
But seeing her sitting on my counter with her legs spread and her pretty
pink pussy on display? She's a fucking goddess.
I drop to my knees, ready to worship her as she deserves. I look up to
find her watching me with heavy-lidded eyes.
“Can I try something?” I ask her.
Her eyes widen for only a moment. “You've never…?”
I shake my head once. “No.”
“Oh. I'd be your…first?”
And hopefully my last.
I don't know where the thought comes from, but it slams into me all the
same. I don't know if I like it or if I even want it to be true, but it doesn't
necessarily feel wrong.
“Yes.”
“Okay.”
“Can you…tell me how you'd write it?”
“What?”
“Tell me how they do it in your books. I want this to be good for you. I
want to be good for you.”
She swallows thickly, and her chest heaves. I think she's going to say
no, think she won't do it.
But then she says, “Kiss my thighs first.” Another hard swallow. “The
hero would kiss my thighs first.”
So, I do. I press my lips to the spot just above her knee and kiss my way
up, up, up until just before the haven between her legs. Then, I start again
on the other leg. I repeat it over and over until she's squirming on the
counter.
“Miller…” She crashes her fingers through my hair, tugging on the
strands. “You're killing me.”
“In a good way?”
“Yes, but I need more…”
“What next?”
“Taste me…” she begs. “Please.”
She guides my head toward her pussy, and I'm happy to follow her
instructions.
I flatten my tongue, sliding it against her, and now I'm the one making
noises because holy hell. She tastes incredible. Sweet, just like I knew she
would.
I do it again. And again. She tilts her hips, giving me better access as I
continue to lavish her. Her moans fill the kitchen, and I swear if someone
recorded it, I would listen to it all day.
“Suck my clit,” she instructs.
I pull the little bud into my mouth, applying pressure, and she damn
near flies off the counter.
“Oh god.” Another moan. “Don't stop. Please.”
I drag her even closer until she's teetering on the edge, gripping my hair
for leverage as I continue to suck and lick and tease her into oblivion. I do it
not only because she loves it, but because I love it. I think I could move in
here if she'd let me.
“I'm so close,” she mutters. “So, so close.”
And that's the last coherent thing that leaves her mouth as she trembles
around me, her thighs squeezing me almost too tightly as she rides the
waves of her orgasm on my tongue.
Her grip on my hair slowly loosens, and her legs relax. I know I need
the air, but I almost don't want it. If this is how I go, it'll be the sweetest
death of all time.
I give her one last kiss before sitting back, and I peer up at her. Her
chest is rising and falling rapidly, her eyes still screwed tightly shut. There's
a faint sheen of sweat along her forehead, but I swear she looks more
relaxed than I've ever seen her before.
She peels her eyes open one at a time, then looks down at me.
“Well?” I ask, brow raised. “How'd I do?”
She laughs breathlessly. “I think you just earned that A-plus.”
“You've never been to a hockey game before?”
She shakes her head. “Nope. I mean, I've watched plenty thanks to
Macie, but I've never attended a live game.”
“Well, we'll have to change that. You can come to one of mine, cheer
me on.” I tug at the jersey she's still wearing. “Maybe you can wear this.
The number thirteen suits you.”
Completely stuffed from the cold pizza we devoured, we're lounging on
the couch, both refusing to move. Scout has her legs draped over my lap,
and every time she wiggles around, I get to see what's underneath her shirt
—nothing.
“I bet you say that to all the girls.”
“You do remember our whole virgin conversation, right?”
“Well, yeah,” she says, picking at her sleeve, not looking at me. “But I
assume you've had girlfriends or girls at your games.”
“No.”
She slowly drags her eyes to me. “No?”
“You heard me. No, I've never had a girlfriend before, and I definitely
don't bring random girls to my games like some guys in the league who
hand their game tickets out to whatever puck bunny they find. That's not
my style.”
Her mouth forms an O. “You've never had a girlfriend?”
“I didn't go to prom or homecoming. I never missed a day of school or
snuck out of the house or went to a frat party. I've also never had a job that
wasn't hockey.”
Her eyes grow bigger and bigger the longer the list gets. “That's…wow.
You weren't kidding when you said your entire life has been hockey.”
“I really wasn't.”
“Is that… How do you feel about it? Do you regret it?”
I wave my hand around my apartment, which costs a ridiculous amount
of money. “It's kind of hard to sometimes.” Keeping one hand on her leg, I
squeeze the back of my neck with the other. I exhale a heavy breath. “But
sometimes, yeah. I just feel like I've missed out on so much, you know? I
hear stories from the other guys about goofy shit they used to do, but I don't
have any stories like that. When I say my parents were dead set on me
making it into the NHL, I mean it. They had my sister when they were
young and broke. Then I came along, and they were really broke then. Until
they realized I had skills. So, I became everything to them. I was their
future, their retirement plan.”
She doesn't say anything for several moments, and when I finally look
over to check on her, I'm surprised to find her face red with anger.
“What?”
“That is the most fucked-up thing I've ever heard, Miller.”
I laugh, though there isn't an ounce of humor in it. “It is pretty fucked
up, huh?”
“Yes!” She shuffles around until she's sitting up more. “You're not a
retirement plan. You're their fucking kid. They should have never, ever
done that to you. They took so much away.”
“But they gave me a lot too.”
“What? Money? That comes and goes. They should have let you be a
kid, make stupid mistakes, experience things—not make your entire life
about a game so they had something to fall back on. It makes me so mad.”
“It makes me mad too.”
“How's your relationship now that you are where you are?”
“The same as it's always been. When my career is riding a high, they're
happy and leave me alone. But when I slip…that's when I hear from them,
and it's just so they can tell me to be better.”
She shakes her head in disgust. “I'm so sorry. You deserve better than
that.”
She's right; I do, but right now, it's not a battle I want to fight. Right
now, I just want to find what makes me happy, and at this moment, it's
Scout.
Before she can protest, I reach over and haul her into my lap until she's
straddling me.
“Hi,” I say once I have her right where I want her. Her mouth is mere
inches from mine, and I want to devour it.
“Hi,” she repeats with a smile. “What are you doing?”
“I'm changing the subject.”
“Oh?”
“Yep. Anatomy. Wait, no—I meant sex ed.”
She giggles. “Is that so?”
“Yes. I think I'm failing, and I need a tutor. Could you help?”
Scout wiggles, and I know there's no way she doesn't feel my very hard
dick, which my sweatpants are concealing rather poorly.
“I think I can give you some pointers.”
I drive my hips into her. “I can give you some pointers.”
She pulls back, screwing her face up. “That was terrible.”
I laugh, tugging her back to me and giving her a gentle kiss. “It really
was. This is why I need help.”
“Clearly.”
“I'm willing to do whatever it takes to earn a passing grade. Maybe
some extra credit?”
“Extra credit, huh?”
“Yes. Anything.”
“Kiss me, then.”
So, I do. Our pace is slow and sweet as I take my time with her, our
tongues moving together in perfect rhythm. I slip my hands under the
jersey, cupping her ass and massaging her cheeks as she grinds her hips
against me.
Fuck. My cock is aching, hurting even. I need a release, and I need it
badly. I've never felt like this before, like I could combust and never be the
same again. I shouldn't be surprised, though—everything with Scout seems
to feel different.
She dances her fingers under my shirt, lightly dragging her fingernails
over my abdomen. It feels good, but I want to feel more.
I break our kiss just long enough to strip my shirt from my body, then I
pull her mouth back to mine. I try to bring her back toward me, but she
shakes her head, shoving me back against the couch.
She tugs the jersey over her head.
And that's how Scout ends up naked in my lap.
She's gorgeous. Her deep brown hair is still a little damp from her
shower, and I love the way it curls around her shoulders. Her cheeks are
painted red from our kissing, and her eyes are glassy with desire.
Yeah, her stomach has rolls, there are stretch marks on her skin, and her
hips and legs have dimples all over them, but I love every single fucking
inch of her.
I reach out, dragging my finger across one of the deeper red marks on
her belly. The first thought I have is dumb. Does it hurt? Of course it
doesn't. Or maybe it does, just not in a physical way.
I continue tracing the others, then run my fingertips over the dimples on
her legs. I do it not only because I love them, but because I want her to
know I'm not bothered by them at all. She's made a few comments about
her body and how she's not the “typical” woman I would date, whatever the
fuck that means, and it pains me to think she would believe she's not
enough for me just because of something silly like stretch marks or
cellulite.
Her body is beautiful, but she's more than that. She's Scout, and that's
what I like so much about her.
“Please say something,” she whispers.
When I finally shift my eyes to her face, I see she's looking at me with
worry in hers.
“Can I suck on your tits?”
A laugh bubbles out of her. “That was kind of the plan.”
I don't waste a second, leaning forward and capturing one of her nipples
between my teeth. She groans the second the tight, pink bud touches my
tongue, and all I can think is, I love it too, Scout.
I play with her breasts, moving from one to the other, sucking and
licking and kissing them until she's rocking against my painfully hard cock.
There's an obvious wet spot forming on my sweats, and seeing how turned
on she is right now is about to send me over the edge.
I grip her hips, stilling her movements because I'm about two seconds
from embarrassing myself and need her to stop moving.
“No. No, no, no,” she chants. “I need…”
“Scout, if you keep rubbing against me, I'm going to come in my
pants.”
Her eyes pop open, and I swear, based on the look in her eyes, she likes
the idea of that.
“I want to see.”
“What?”
“I want to see you come.”
I've never jacked off in front of a girl before, and the thought of doing it
makes me momentarily nervous, but I don't care. I need to come, and if it's
what Scout wants, I want it too.
I pull my sweats down as far as I can with her still on my lap, letting my
cock spring free between us. She stares down at me, her tongue darting out
of her mouth to wet her lips, liking what she sees.
Funny, because I'm liking what I see too—a naked Scout on my lap
with her pussy drenching my thighs.
Unable to help myself, I reach out, slipping two fingers between her
legs. She lets out a soft moan when I pump two fingers inside of her,
running circles over her clit with my thumb.
But just as soon as she begins rocking against me, I remove them.
“Ugh, you're the worst. I—”
Her words die on her lips when she watches the hand that's coated in
her move around my cock and begin to stroke.
“Oh god,” she mutters, unable to look away.
I press my free hand against her lower belly and use my thumb to put
pressure on her clit as she moves her hips in time with me. She can't take
her eyes off me, and I can't take mine off her as I continue to stroke myself.
“I'm so close, Miller,” she says, her breaths coming in sharper and
sharper by the second. “So…ahhh.”
Her body convulses as she falls apart, and I feel it. The sight of her with
her head thrown back, tits still on full display and red from the scratchiness
of my beard is almost enough to send me over the edge.
“Shit, Scout. I'm going to come.”
“Do it.” She cups the back of my neck, scratching her nails along my
skin. “On me. Do it on me.”
I look up to make sure she's not joking—and she's not. Her eyes are
glazed over, and her face is red and she's breathing hard, but there isn't an
ounce of her that's kidding. I've never been more fucking turned on.
I watch her as she watches me, jacking myself until I'm spilling all over
her stomach and tits.
Fuck me.
The sight of my cum on her is killing me because I love the idea of
marking her up, claiming her, making her mine.
She reaches down, smearing her finger through a bit of it, playing with
it.
Then I watch with absolute fucking delight as she drags her finger
through the mess and licks it clean.
It's the hottest thing I've ever witnessed.
Not caring that she's just had me in her mouth, I crash my lips to hers,
kissing her until we're both gasping for air.
When we finally break, she sags against me, not caring about the mess
between us as we work to catch our breath. I might be an athlete with
amazing stamina, but holy hell, I am tired right now. I feel like I could close
my eyes and fall asleep.
I'm not sure how long we sit there or how many strangled breaths we
gasp in, but it's long enough for her to go quiet.
“Hey,” I whisper, “are you asleep?”
She shakes her head, peeling herself off me and back up into a sitting
position. There's a lazy grin on her face, which makes me grin.
“No. I'm just exhausted.”
“Good exhausted?”
“Very, very good.” Her smile grows wider. “Not bad for a first
sleepover, Miller. Not bad at all.”

SCOUT
It's official: I can't stop smiling.
And it's all because of Miller.
We've been spending all our free time together. If he's not at the rink,
he's here. If he doesn't have a game, I'm staying the night at his place, and
he's giving me orgasms until the sun comes up.
I'm tired all the time, but even so, there is absolutely nothing that could
knock this grin off my face right now.
“What's my baby girl smiling so hard about?”
I freeze in shock at the familiar voice. There's no way…
I look up, and yep, my father is standing outside of the truck. His
graying hair is brushed back in its usual style, and he's wearing his famous
tan khakis and polo shirt. Pops was always the more fashion-forward of the
two, but he never pushed Dad to wear anything he didn't want to, so he
didn't.
Meanwhile, I'm in here thinking about all the dirty things I got up to
last night with the pro hockey player I'm kind of dating.
“You're… Dad!”
He lifts his dark, bushy brows, laughing. “That'd be me. How's my girl
doing?”
“Good. Great. Good.” Oh god. Even I hear how high-pitched and
surprised my voice is right now. “Great.”
“That's good. Or should I say great?”
“Sorry,” I say with a short laugh. “I'm a little tired and just wasn't
expecting you, is all.”
“What? An old man can't surprise his daughter at work?”
“Of course you can. I just…” I lift my gloved hands; they're covered in
the filling for our Comets Cosmic Brownie donut, which is stuffed with
brownie batter.
“I got that, boss,” Rosie says, pushing me aside. “Go visit with your
dad, and I'll finish these up.”
I glance over at her. “Are you sure?”
“Of course. I just finished prepping the pudding for the Bananas Over
You donut, so I need something new to do.”
“Okay,” I say, tugging my gloves off. “If you insist. Dad, you want a
coffee or anything?”
“That'd be great, sweetie. And maybe a—”
“Cheery Cherry Cheesecake donut?”
He grins. “You know me so well. I'll go grab us a spot.”
I toss my gloves away and wash my hands, then pour a hot black coffee
for my father and make myself a vanilla cold brew. After grabbing us each a
donut, I find him sitting at a table…and he's not alone.
“Miller!”
He turns at the sound of his name, spinning around to grin at me.
“Hey, thanks,” he says, jumping up to grab the cold brew from my
hands and smacking a kiss on my cheek. “How'd you know that's what I
wanted?” He nods toward my father. “This guy was just telling me about
how he's a huge Comets fan.”
I'm frozen in place, my eyes wide as I meet my dad's very confusedslash-amused expression.
“Well,” he says quietly, “this is quite the surprise.”
You have no idea.
I shake my head, then walk forward, sliding his coffee across the table. I
take a seat, and Miller slides in next to me.
“I see you two have already met, but I suppose a formal introduction is
in order…” I look from my father to Miller. “Miller, this is my dad. Dad,
this is…”
I trail off because I'm not entirely sure what to say about who Miller is
to me. We're dating, but I'm not sure he'd be comfortable with me labeling
him my boyfriend.
I settle on: “This is Grady.”
“The Grady Miller,” my dad says. “As in the Comets' Grady Miller.”
“Yes,” I confirm, even though I don't need to.
“Dad…” Miller's eyes grow about three sizes. He gulps. “Oh.” He
wipes his hand on his pant leg, then extends it my father's way. “It's great
to meet you, sir.”
My dad eyes his hand warily, taking a sip from his coffee, flicking his
gaze between me and Miller. “Hmm. When did this happen?”
Miller takes his hand back, laughing awkwardly. He looks nervous, and
I can't say I blame him. Dad is a former firefighter and a big, burly guy.
He's intimidating until you get to know him and find out he's just a big
softy.
“Well, it's kind of a long story,” Miller starts.
“I'm retired. I have time.”
“Right.” Another awkward chuckle from Miller. “We, uh, we've known
one another for a while.”
“You know the Comets come by here a lot,” I add.
Miller nods. “Yeah, we love this place. It's one of our favorites. I met
Scout here.” He shakes his head. “No, wait—that's not true. I mean, it kind
of is, but not.”
I dare a peek at my father, who has his brows pinched tightly together,
hanging on Miller's every word.
“I was an idiot, sir. I knew your daughter from the truck, but I didn't
really know her. She wasn't on my radar. I screwed up and hurt her feelings,
and it made me feel like absolute shit.”
His face sours like he still feels that way just thinking about it.
“So,” he continues. “I made it my mission to make it up to her.” He
shoots me a grin, and I can't help but smile back at him. “And after a lot of
groveling and admitting what a moron I am, she forgave me. After spending
so much time with her, I knew I would never forgive myself if I didn't do
everything I could to extend it. So, I did. I asked her out, and, luckily, she
said yes.”
My dad looks at me, surprised by this. He knows what I went through
with Aaron and how I've stayed single since everything went down with
him. The fact that I'm dipping my toes back into the dating pool with a
hockey player is mind-blowing to me too.
“It's still new,” Miller tells him, resting his hand on my leg. “But I like
her, sir.” He gives me a gentle squeeze. “A lot.”
I like you a lot, too.
It surprises me how true the words are. I'm trying hard not to get too
attached to him. Sure, we're spending a lot of time together, but I keep
reminding myself this is all new for him. He's never had a relationship
before, and he's never done any of this. I'm not stupid enough to think he's
going to stick around. He'll probably get his fill and leave me in the dust,
ready for something else. I get it.
Besides, it's not like I'm not benefiting from this too, and I don't just
mean orgasms. I wrote a whole new chapter this morning during my break.
My inspiration is at an all-time high.
“Okay,” my dad says, pulling my attention back to him.
“Okay?” Miller asks, looking at me for confirmation.
My dad shrugs. “Yeah. As long as you own up to your mistakes and
treat my daughter right from now on, okay. My partner…” He smiles
wistfully, no doubt picturing his late husband. “He'd have loved how honest
you're being right now. I appreciate it too.”
“Scout has told me a bit about him,” Miller says. “Sounds like he was a
great guy.”
Dad looks over at me, likely because he knows how big of a deal it is
that I've talked about Pops with anyone, let alone with Miller. “He was the
best. He loved hockey and even got me into it. He followed you in the
AHL, thought you had some great potential. It's a bummer he didn't get to
see the team lift the Cup.”
Miller sits up straighter on the bench, his grip on my thigh growing
firmer as if he's struggling with the same emotions that are coursing
through me as I listen to my father talk about his husband.
“The next time we do it, it'll be for him. I promise you that.”
His words are like a hug to my heart, because I know no matter what
happens between us, he means them. That's just the kind of guy Miller is.
“Thank you,” Dad says softly, his voice thick with emotion. He clears
his throat, taking another sip of his coffee. “Your sister told me you've been
writing.”
I groan. “Ugh. Stevie needs to mind her own business.”
A laugh rumbles out of him. “She's just excited. It's been so long
since…”
I nod. “I know, but still…I don't want to rush into anything.”
He tightens his lips like he has a lot more to say on the subject but
decides not to.
“I'd love to read what you're writing,” Miller says, and every ounce of
my body tenses.
I'm already pretty particular about who I let read my work, but the
thought of having Miller see has my body breaking out in a sweat.
He's looking at me so hopefully and supportively that I don't want to
break his heart.
“Maybe sometime.”
This elicits another surprised look from my father.
I ignore it.
We chat for a while longer about the upcoming hockey season, and my
dad tells Miller what he thinks the team needs to do, and how Miller might
consider trying a fake shot next time to get it past the Arizona goalie since I
guess he bites on those often. Miller's nice enough to just nod and play
along like he's actually going to take anything he says seriously.
When there's a natural lull in the conversation, my dad sighs and
smacks the table with both hands. That's his signature move when it's time
to leave.
“Well,” he says, right on cue, rising from the bench, “I guess I better get
out of your hair, let you get back to the truck and, you, Miller, back to
hockey where I'd best see you try some fake-outs.”
Miller laughs, pushing up to his feet. “Yes, sir.”
This time when he extends his hand, my father shakes it.
Then my dad looks at me, opening his arms, and I fall right into them
like I always do. It's a warm hug, the kind that feels like home.
“I like him,” my father whispers in my ear. “And Pops would too.”
Tears spring to my eyes, and I have to blink them away quickly before
Miller sees them. No reason I need to embarrass myself right now.
“Thanks,” I mutter, sniffling as I pull back.
He pecks a kiss on my forehead, gives Miller one last wave, then takes
off.
“Well,” Miller says after a few moments of silence, “I didn't realize I
was meeting the family today.”
I laugh. “I didn't either. He just showed up.”
He lifts his hand, squeezing the back of his neck. “I, uh, noticed you
kind of hesitated when introducing me.”
I grimace. “You caught that, huh?” He nods. “I wasn't sure what we're
labeling this or if we're labeling this.”
“I mean, we've been seeing one another for nearly two months now. I'm
okay with a label if you are.”
“Really?”
“Really.”
“And it's…exclusive?”
A dark look crosses his features. “I don't fucking share, Scout.”
The deep rumble that leaves him almost scares me because I am not
expecting the turn his mood has taken.
But oddly, I find it incredibly hot that he's being so protective over me
—not that he has a reason to be. I haven't been with anyone in years, and
there are absolutely zero other people I'm interested in.
“I don't want to share either.”
The tension releases from his shoulders, and he relaxes. “Good.”
“Good.” I nod. “I guess that makes us…”
“Boyfriend and girlfriend. Another first for me,” he mutters.
“I feel special I'm getting all your firsts.”
He blushes at that, and it's cute to see a massive, grown-ass hockey
player blush.
“So, uh, no offense or anything, but what are you doing here?”
“Right. That.” He tucks his hands into his pockets and shrugs. “I'm
leaving tonight, so I figured I'd pop in and see you. You know, in case you
miss me while I'm gone.”
“I think you'll be the one missing me.”
He furrows his brows. “Of course I will.”
“I am very missable.”
He laughs, reaching out and grabbing one of the straps on my overalls,
tugging me closer to him. He rests his ass at the end of the picnic table, and
I step between his legs. It feels natural, like we've done this dance a
thousand times before.
I'm not sure how to feel about it, but I do know I'm not willing to
decipher it right now either.
“Come on, Girlfriend Scout, admit that you're going to miss me.”
I can't help but grin at my new name.
“Your orgasms, maybe. But you?” I shrug. “Eh.”
“Eh? Eh?” He nuzzles his nose against my cheek. “I'll show you eh.”
He attacks me with his mouth, kissing me breathless before wrenching
his lips from mine and peppering kisses along my jawline, down my neck
on both sides, then back to my lips. I'm unsurprised when I'm gasping for
air and basically rubbing myself against him by the time he pulls away.
“Are you sure you're not going to miss me?” he asks, a wicked grin on
his face.
“I'm sure.”
He captures my mouth in another heated kiss, his hands moving lower
and lower until he's cupping my ass, pulling me so close I can feel his
hardened cock straining against his jeans. We should stop. This is my place
of business. It's entirely inappropriate what we're doing. As much as I don't
want to stop—and I really don't want to—I drag my mouth from his.
“What about now?” he asks, just as out of breath as I am.
“If I say yes, will you promise to stop kissing me like that? We're going
to make a scene.”
“Yes.”
“Then yes, Boyfriend Miller, I'll miss you.”
“I don't know, I feel like you're just saying it to say it now.”
“Miller…” I growl, and he laughs.
“Fine, fine. I believe you.”
“Good. Because I will, Grady. I'll miss you.”
It's true. He's going to be gone for a week, and I will miss him, not just
because of the orgasms or the kisses, but because I like being around him
entirely too much.
“Say it again.”
“I'll miss you.”
“No, the other part.”
“Your name?” He nods. “I'll miss you, Grady.”
He sighs.
And then he breaks his promise and kisses me senseless all over again.

MILLER & SCOUT
Miller: How's my girlfriend doing?
Scout: Wow. You're really leaning into this, huh?
Miller: Of course I am. It's a first for me.
Scout: I still can't believe that.
Miller: Well, it's true. Sadly.
Scout: But you're you. It makes no sense.
Miller: Believe it or not, I used to be shy.
Scout: Not. I definitely do not believe that.
Scout: I honestly cannot fathom it.
Miller: It's true. I didn't really start coming out of my shell until I
hit the NHL. It was the first time I didn't have to be under my
parents' constant watch and control.
Scout: I suppose that checks out.
Scout: It's still hard to believe you weren't always a relentless
flirt.
Miller: Relentless is a good word for it. Wore you down, that's
for sure.
Scout: Ugh. Don't remind me.
Miller: That you're my girlfriend?
Miller: Because you're my girlfriend, Scout.
Scout: You're loving that word, huh?
Miller: So much.
Scout: I'm glad. Now, leave me alone so I can work,
boyfriend.
Miller: Sure thing…girlfriend.
Scout: You're exhausting.
Miller: I can exhaust you.
Scout: You already do.
Miller: Wait.
Miller: That wasn't a compliment, was it?
Scout: *zips lips*
Miller: Whatever. I'm taking it as one.
Scout: Shocker.
Miller: I could really go for one of your vanilla cold brew
coffees this morning.
Scout: You know that's not a specialty drink only the truck
has, right? You can order it pretty much anywhere.
Miller: Yeah, but it's not the same.
Miller: Plus, I'd feel like I'm cheating on you or something.
Miller: And I am NOT cheating on you, by the way.
Miller: Not with donuts or coffee or sex.
Miller: Not that we've had sex yet, but still.
Miller: NO CHEATING.
Scout: Miller?
Miller: Yeah?
Scout: Shut up.
Miller: That's fair.
Miller: Kind of got myself worked up there, huh?
Scout: Maybe a little.
Scout: But I'm happy to know you're not cheating on me.
Scout: Donuts or otherwise.
Miller: I never would. Some of these guys…the shit they do…I
hate it. I don't ever want to be that person. Not like your ex.
Scout: Trust me, you're nothing like him.
Miller: Because my dick is totally bigger, right?
Scout: JESUS
Miller: It's Miller.
Scout: You can't just send me random texts like that!
Miller: What? Is it not true?
Scout: You're fishing.
Miller: I am. Are you going to take the bait?
Scout: Nah.
Miller: I'll just assume it is then.
Scout: Anyone tell you you're exhausting yet today?
Miller: Just Greer. And Smith. Then Rhodes and Wright.
Lowell's the only one who has been nice.
Scout: He has a baby at home. Nothing annoys him anymore.
Miller: Fair assessment.
Miller: Shit. Coach is calling. Video-chat later?
Scout: I'm still not having phone sex with you, Miller.
Miller: BOO!
Scout: Hey, Miller?
Scout: Your dick is bigger.
Miller: I FUCKING KNEW IT!
Miller: I miss you.
Scout: I miss you too.
Scout: You totally screenshot that, didn't you?
Miller: 100%
Miller: I can't wait to see you tomorrow.
Scout: I can't either. Good night, Miller.
Miller: Good night, girlfriend.

MILLER
We have five minutes left on the clock, and we're one goal down.
I want so damn badly to beat New York right now, especially since they
were the assholes to knock us out of the first round last year. We got swept,
and I want to get back at them for it.
“Come on, Lowell! Fucking move!” Rhodes yells, and I guess he's
feeling the same way I am. “We got this,” he says, though I'm not sure if
he's talking to me or himself. “I can feel it.”
I fucking hope he's right. I'm not too eager for bonus hockey tonight.
Tonight, all I want to do is get home and see the one person I've been dying
to see for days—Scout.
Our road schedule is grueling, and we've been gone for over a week
now. We've been texting and have video-chatted a few times, but it's not the
same. I want to see her. I want to touch her. I just want to be around her
because I really, really fucking miss her.
“Heads in the game, boys,” Coach says from behind us, almost like he
knows I'm not thinking about hockey right now. “We got this. We fucking
got this.”
We watch for cues, and as soon as Lowell comes off the ice, I hop on.
Once I'm where I need to be, off comes Greer for the extra skater.
Fitzgerald barrels into the zone, looking for a wide-open spot on the left. I
zing the puck over to him, and he sends it out to Wright, who zips it back to
me.
I wind up and shoot.
The goalie blocks it, but the puck is still in play, and the juicy rebound
goes directly for the rookie.
And, thanks to him, we score.
We skate along the bench bumping gloves but head back for the grind
because the game isn't over yet. Back to center ice we go.
They blow the whistle, and the puck is dropped.
I battle with the captain of New York. He's tough…but I'm better. I get
the puck loose and to Rhodes, who sends it to Wright. Off goes Greer yet
again as they get the play set up. Back and forth and back, making the other
team dizzy with their efforts.
Rhodes. Wright. Rhodes. Me. Rhodes.
Then right in the back of the net with just enough time to spare.
“Fuck yes!” I yell, jumping against the glass as my teammates crowd
around me and celebrate.
We're back in this, and with any luck, we can score again. It's not over
yet. There's still some time left on the clock, and everyone knows every
single second and inch counts in hockey, so we can't get too cocky.
New York takes their timeout, and we hustle over to the bench, listening
as the coaches go over everything we need to do to get the job done.
When that buzzer sounds thirty seconds later, it's my favorite victory of
the season so far.
After celebrations in the locker room, we go straight to the tarmac. It's
late, and we have a flight to catch because we're finally going home.
Scout's definitely asleep, so there's no way I'm seeing her tonight, but
just the thought of being able to walk up to the truck tomorrow and see her
smiling face has me downright giddy.
“What the hell do you look so cheery for? It's late as shit, man.”
I glance over to find a rather sourpuss-looking Greer sliding into the
seat next to me. “Dude, how can you be grumpy? We just won.”
“I'm not grumpy. This is just my face.”
I laugh because he's not exactly wrong. He does look grumpy all the
time, even when I know that's not the case. “You should probably get that
fixed.”
He flips me off and pulls his headphones out of their case. “I plan to—
with beauty rest.”
“You're going to need a lot.”
Another middle finger is sent my way. “Seriously, though, aside from
the win, why are you so damn happy?”
“I'm excited to get home, is all.”
His eyes light up at that. “That's right—donut girl. How's that going?
Have you…” He looks around, then leans in close. “Did you finally ditch
the v-card?”
“I'm not discussing my sex life with you.”
He scoffs, looking disappointed. “That means no.”
“We haven't. Yet.”
“Ha!” he says loudly. “I knew it!”
“Dude, shut the fuck up,” I hiss, glancing around to make sure nobody
is paying attention.
Most of the guys are already asleep, and a few of them are on their
phones, probably with their wives. I can see Lowell's screen from here, and
he's just watching his baby sleep. None of them are paying us any mind,
thank fuck.
His brows slam together. “Seriously, dude? You've been hanging out
with her constantly, and you still haven't hit that?”
Annoyance builds in my chest at the way he's talking about Scout like
she's just a random conquest and not someone I genuinely care about.
“It's… Well, she's Scout.”
“Yeah, I know who she is, numbnuts, but come on. You can't tell me
you haven't had the chance—you're just too chickenshit to actually do it.”
Have there been moments when I thought we'd tear each other's clothes
off? Sure. Do I want to do just that every time I see her? Yes, but I really
don't want her to think the only reason I'm with her is to lose my virginity,
because it's not that at all.
She means so much more to me than that.
Don't get me wrong, fooling around with her is incredible, but it's not
even about that.
I like her sense of humor and the way her mind works. I like how hard
she works and how she gives her business her all. I like the way she treats
people and how she wears her heart on her sleeve. I like her laugh and her
smile, and I fucking love her body.
I just like her.
When I'm away from her, I miss her, and when I'm with her, the world
just seems to click into place. I've never had that before. I've never found a
person I want to spend all of my time with.
Scout is more than sex. She's more than just some random person I'm
spending time with.
She's… “Everything.”
“What?”
I gulp, then shake my head. “Nothing. It's nothing.”
He looks like he doesn't believe me, like he wants to ask a million
questions, but thankfully, he doesn't.
“I'm done talking to you about this.”
He shakes his head. “Whatever, man. But don't come crying to me
when you're turning twenty-five and still carrying that card around.”
He pulls his headphones over his head, leans back against the seat, and
closes his eyes. He's going to sleep.
He's going to sleep, and I'm sitting here realizing Scout means more to
me than anyone ever has before and…I think I might be in love with her.
I'm no longer sure I can wait until tomorrow to see her. It needs to be
tonight.
I have to see her.
Our flight home is a short one, and we're landing back in North
Carolina before I know it. I say my goodnights to the guys, then race to my
Porsche. I don't think about the time or the implication of showing up at her
apartment at this hour—I just go straight there.
The lot is fairly dark when I arrive, and I try to guess which apartment
is hers from the outside of the building. There are a few with their TVs still
on, and I pray one of them is hers.
I take the stairs two at a time, completely focused on getting to her door
when I crash directly into someone.
“Oh shit. I'm sorry. I—Miller?”
I look up to find Scout standing in the middle of the walkway.
“Scout…what are you doing?”
“I could ask you the same thing.”
“I…” I glance down at the bag she's holding in her hand. “Are you
going somewhere?”
“Your place.”
“My place?”
She nods, a blush stealing over her cheeks. “I wanted to see you. I was
hoping you'd take pity on me and let me in for the night.”
Something I've never felt before swells inside my chest at her
confession, and it's so strong I physically rub at the spot where I feel it.
She missed me too.
“What's in your bag?” I ask, taking a step closer to her.
“Clothes for tomorrow, some pajamas…”
Another step. “Pajamas, huh?”
She nods, looking sheepish.
One last step and I'm standing just in front of her, peering down at her
as she looks up at me with wide, excited eyes.
I grip her chin between my fingers. “What'd I say about pajamas?”
Then I claim her mouth with mine and show her just how much I
missed her.
The elevator ride up to my apartment is quiet. We're literally standing on
opposite sides of the space. It's like we know if we stand too close, there's
no way we're making it to my floor with all our clothes on.
And I'm really looking forward to not having my clothes on with her.
The car arrives on my floor, and we hurry down the hall to my
apartment. The second we're inside, my mouth is on hers. Her back meets
the door with a loud moan as I slide my tongue between her lips, tasting her
for the first time in what feels like years.
I missed this.
I missed her.
My hand comes up around her throat, gripping her gently and holding
her there as I have my way with her mouth.
“God, you taste good,” I tell her, nipping my way across her jaw to that
spot just below her ear. She moans when I bite down, then lick away the
pain.
“Miller…” she pants.
She shoves at my suit jacket, and I shrug it down my shoulders, letting
it fall to the floor in a heap. She begins plucking the buttons on my dress
shirt free as my hands find the stupidly sexy yoga pants she's wearing and
push them down.
She steps out of them, then yanks her shirt over her head, leaving her
leaning against the door in nothing but her bra and panties. As hot as she
looks right now, I want them both gone. I want her bare and spread out
before me.
As if she's thinking the same thing, she pushes off the door and kisses
me, trailing her mouth from mine and down my chin, over my throat, across
my chest. Her descent doesn't stop as she drags her soft lips lower and
lower until she's on her knees, her hands on my belt buckle.
It's a beautiful fucking sight, one I could get really used to.
But right now, it's not what I want.
I want her.
I've been close to this moment before, but never in my life has it felt as
right as it feels tonight, as right as she feels.
I grab her by the chin, tugging her back, and she stands.
“Is everything okay?” she asks, worrying her bottom lip between her
teeth. I ease her concern with a soft kiss, wrapping my arms around her
waist.
“As much as I love the way you look on your knees for me, Scout, I was
kind of thinking of something else…”
“What…” It takes a moment for what I'm asking of her to register, and
when it does, she looks shocked. “Oh. Are you…sure?”
“I've never been surer of anything in my entire life.”
“Okay, then.”
“Yeah?” She nods. “Good.”
I haul her into my arms, and her legs go around my waist on instinct. I
crash my mouth to hers and carry her through the apartment and down the
hall to my bedroom. I don't stop until my knees hit the bed. Then, slowly, I
set her down.
I reach around and unhook her bra as I continue to kiss her, and she
finally gets the buckle of my pants undone. I toss the garment somewhere
off to the side as I drop to my knees before her.
She leans back on her hands as I shoulder my way between her thighs,
placing soft kisses up them just as she taught me before. I kiss and lick my
way to her sweet, sweet center, treasuring the groan that leaves her when
my tongue finally lands right where she wants it.
“Fuck, you taste so good,” I mutter against her. “I swear I could spend
an hour with my tongue on your cunt.”
“I swear I'd let you,” she says, shivering as I suck her clit into my
mouth.
Her fingers slide through my hair, holding me to her until her legs are
quaking around me and she's chanting my name.
“Grady, Grady, Grady.”
She says it over and over as she comes on my tongue. When her shaking
subsides, I shove up to my feet, and her hands are on my belt in an instant.
She pulls my pants and boxer briefs down my thighs, and the minute my
cock springs free, she wraps her lips around it, tasting me for the first time
like she can't wait another second for it.
I groan, crashing my hands through her hair as she continues to lick and
suck on me. I want to come. I want to bury my cock in the back of her
throat and fuck her hard until she's gagging around me.
But more than that, I want to feel her come apart around my dick.
With a gentle tug at her hair, I pull her off. She peers up at me, eyes
glassy and lips swollen from my kisses and her own.
“As much as I want to come down your throat, I want to come inside
you even more.”
Her eyes flare, and she nods, scooting back farther on the bed. I step out
of my pants, kicking them away, then head for the bedside table.
I pull open the drawer and grab a condom.
She arches a brow, and I shrug.
“Wishful thinking.”
She laughs, but it's cut off when I kiss her deeply. Not moving my lips
from hers, I crawl onto the bed, positioning myself between her legs. I
break our kiss, and with shaking fingers, I tear open the condom packet.
Scout doesn't miss it. Her hands cover mine, and I look down at her.
“Let me,” she says softly, and I nod.
She pulls the condom from the wrapper, then fits it over my cock,
rolling it down and giving me a few extra strokes.
“Are you nervous?” she asks, her hand still on my dick.
I shake my head. “No. I'm shaking because if you keep touching me,
I'm going to come, and this will be over before it even started.”
She laughs, giving me one last languid stroke before trailing her hands
up my abs, tugging me down on top of her as she falls to the mattress.
I'm not lying to her; I'm not nervous. I feel like I should be, but I can't
find it in me, and that's because this moment? Right here with Scout?
It's right.
I slide my hand between us and line my cock up with her body.
Then, inch by delicious fucking inch, I push inside her.
“Oh god,” I groan into her shoulder as I slowly slide in until there's
nothing more I can give. I'm holding on to her so tightly there's no way
she's not going to bruise, but I need the stability to keep me grounded
because I swear it feels like I'm two seconds away from floating on air with
the pure euphoria I feel right now.
“It's… You're… Fuck.”
She chuckles, which makes her squeeze my cock even harder, and I
want to die.
Wait—no. I definitely want to keep living in this moment. In fact, I
want to live like this forever, buried inside of Scout, never to return.
She feels incredible. She feels right. She feels like everything I've been
missing in my life.
She feels like mine.
I don't want to move. I'm too scared that if I move, I'll blow my load,
and this will be the most disappointing few minutes of her life.
Think of anything else, Miller. Losing in the Finals. Taking a stick to the
face. Catching a puck on my boot.
“Grady…I need you to move. Please,” she begs on a whisper.
And I can't deny her.
Unhurriedly, I rock my hips. It feels good, so goddamn good I can't
hold back any longer. I pick up my pace, driving into her over and over,
letting the sounds of her moans fill my ears as she angles her hips to meet
my thrusts.
I'm literally shaking. Can feel sweat rolling down my back. I'm so
damn close that if she doesn't come in the next few seconds, this is over.
I don't want it to be over.
I reach between us, letting my thumb brush over her clit, and with a few
more thrusts, she's crying out.
“Oh god, oh god, oh god.”
The minute her pussy squeezes my cock, I'm done for.
I come so hard I swear the life force slowly drains out of me. I collapse
against her like an asshole, but I can't move.
I can't move, can't even think straight. I'm so tired and exhausted it's
taking everything I have just to breathe right now.
She must not care because she wraps her arms around me, holding me
tightly to her.
“You're perfect,” I mutter, and I feel her laugh.
“I'm not.”
“For me, Scout. You're perfect for me, and I really want to tell you
something, but I'm scared you're going to freak out.”
“What is it?” she asks.
But I don't answer her. Instead, I drift off to sleep, repeating in my head
three words I'm too afraid to say out loud.
I love you.

SCOUT
I took Miller's virginity.
I took Miller's virginity, and he told me he loved me.
He was half asleep when he said it, but I heard it all the same.
I'm sure it was nothing, though, sure it was just an in-the-moment kind
of thing because hello, I'd just taken his virginity. I'm sure he would have
said it to any woman at that moment.
Besides, Miller can't love me…can he?
If he does, do I even want him to?
As I peel my eyes open, I try to bury the thoughts, tucking them away to
deal with later. The sun is just barely beginning to brighten the sky, and I
know I should probably get up and go help Rosie at the truck, but I can't
muster the energy. I'm too exhausted from last night.
I didn't have the intention of the night ending in sex and don't think he
did either, but it happened. It happened, and I'm freaking out about it like it
was my first time having sex. I can't imagine how he's feeling.
I roll over to check on him, and my stomach drops.
The bed is empty.
Oh god.
Bile rises in my throat at the realization that he's not here.
Does Miller regret it? Does he wish he could take it back, find someone
else? Someone better? Thoughts race through my head so fast and so loud I
barely register the room around me.
Which is why I don't notice Miller is still here until he pulls open the
bathroom door and grins down at me.
“Hey, you're up,” he says, his voice still scratchy from sleep. He climbs
back into his bed, scooting close but not quite touching me.
I smile at him and wait for the awkwardness to settle in, but it never
comes.
“How are you feeling?”
It takes all of two seconds for us to burst into laughter.
I cover my face. “Oh god, I don't know why I said that. It sounds so
stupid, but I swear that's what they say in movies after someone loses their
virginity, so I thought that was what I should say.”
He tugs my hands away from my face. “It's fine, and I feel fine. The
same, really. But also…lighter? If that makes sense. I mean, I've been
building up that moment for the last twenty-four years. It was…nice.”
“Nice?”
“Incredible.” He rolls until he's on top of me, fitting himself between
my legs like it's the most natural place in the world for him. “Amazing. The
best thing I've ever done, and that includes when I lifted the Stanley Cup
over my head.”
I raise my brows. “That's quite the compliment to my vagina.”
“It's a great vagina. But seriously…” He places a soft kiss on the tip of
my nose. “Thank you. I'm…I'm really glad it was you, Scout.”
“Thank me? Thank you. I had not one but two orgasms last night.”
I don't know why there's emotion building up in my throat, causing it to
burn, or why my eyes begin to sting, but they do.
“Thank you for trusting me.”
He grins and then gives me a soft kiss, which soon turns into more.
I should probably worry about my morning breath, but at this point, I
don't care. Kissing him is just too addicting.
I feel his stiffening cock against me, pressing right between my legs,
which are sore in the best kind of way, and I lift my hips to brush against it.
He groans, then pulls his mouth from mine. “As much as I'd love a
repeat—and I really, really would because I think I could blow your mind
for an entire five minutes this time—I have practice. You're more than
welcome to stay as long as you want, though. There's no rush for you to
go.”
“I appreciate it, but I should probably get to the truck. Rosie is great and
all, but I'm still not sure I trust her to open by herself just yet.”
“You work too hard. You should stay here. Rest—you deserve it.”
Resting does sound nice…
But I also want to get home and grab my laptop before heading to the
truck. I have an idea for a new chapter, and I want to get it out before I
forget it.
I don't tell him that, though. Instead, I say, “The public needs their
donuts. Do you mind if I take a shower before I go? That rain head feels
like heaven.”
“Funny…I thought the same about your pussy last night.” I blush at his
crassness and squeeze my thighs because I like the way the word sounds
rolling off his tongue. He gives me another quick peck before rolling off
me. “But yeah, feel free. The shower's all yours.”
I fly out of bed, entirely too excited about it. He laughs, but it fades fast.
I turn to figure out what made him so quiet.
Apparently, it's me.
I can't even find the energy to be embarrassed about being so naked in
front of him as the morning light slowly begins to brighten the room. I've
never felt so comfortable being naked around someone before, but I do with
Miller, and it's because he's looking at me like he is right now—like he
wants me, like he can't get enough.
“What's wrong?” I ask, looking down to where his eyes are fixed.
It's hard to miss what he's looking at. On each of my thighs are five tiny
bruises from where he was gripping me last night.
He swallows hard, then drags his eyes to mine. “Is it weird that I find
that hot?”
I shake my head because if it's weird he finds it hot, it means it's weird I
find it hot.
I like the idea of Miller marking me. It makes me feel like I belong to
him…and I don't entirely hate the idea of it.
Careful, Scout. You're treading in deep water.
“You know…I could just drive fast,” he says, his eyes still raking over
my body.
“So, like you normally drive?” I tease.
“Woman,” he growls.
“Dirty talk this early?” I tsk. “You're incorrigible, Grady.”
His eyes spark when I say his name, and I know it's his undoing.
“Fuck it,” he says, flying off the bed.
He scoops me into his arms and drags me into the shower with him.
He gripped her tightly by the waist and slammed his mouth against hers.
The kiss was rough and bruising, but Charlie didn't mind. She liked it a
little rough, especially at the hands of the hot hockey player she'd been
dreaming about nonstop.
When he finally released her, her knees were knocking together they
were shaking so hard.
“Take my cock out,” Brady said.
Charlie was eager to oblige.
She dropped to her knees and
“Hey, Aunt Scout?”
I let out a startled gasp, and my laptop almost falls off the countertop
when I jump at the sudden intrusion.
I manage to save it, but the same can't be said for the three spatulas, the
toothpick decorations, and the bowl of sprinkles I knock onto the floor.
“Oopsie,” my niece says. “Sorry.”
I peek up to find Macie standing at the end of the truck, a half-eaten
donut that her mother ordered ten minutes ago in her hand. There's icing on
her face, and even though she just scared the shit out of me, she looks
adorable.
She also looks like she wants something.
“It's okay.” I close my laptop and set it aside, then start cleaning up the
mess I made.
This is what I get for writing while I'm at work. I get so lost in the story
that I stop paying attention to what's going on around me. This is the
second time this week I've been so focused on my fictional world that I've
made a mess of things.
On one hand, it's a good thing I'm so immersed in the story, but I'm
definitely letting it get in the way of what I should be doing. I have to stop
bringing my laptop to work with me.
I've been writing like the wind over the last few days with Miller being
on the road again, and I am so, so close to having the first draft finished that
I'm spending every single free second I have with my fingers on the
keyboard.
Though I'm not sure I want to admit it out loud, I'm scared if I don't
finish this book while things are still hot and heavy with Miller, my muse
may dry up, and it'll never get done.
And I really want to get it done.
“What'd you need, sweetie?” I ask when I catch her lingering at the
door.
She gives me a toothy grin. “You know how Christmas is going to be
here soon?”
“It's still over a month away, but yes, I'm aware of when Christmas is.”
“Now that Miller is your boyfriend, do you think he'll get me Comets
tickets for Christmas?”
I sputter out a laugh, grabbing a handful of toothpick decorations and
tossing them into the trash can. “You can ask him.”
“Like right now?”
“Well, no. He's at work, sweetie.”
“No, he's not. He's here.”
“A guy could get used to a welcome like this,” his deep voice rumbles.
I peer up to find Miller leaning against the entrance to the truck,
smirking down at the sight of me on my knees, I'm sure.
I'd be lying if I said it didn't sound appealing to me too.
I've never really enjoyed blow jobs in the past, but something about
Miller makes me want to try all the things I never used to like again just to
see if he'd make them better somehow.
“Hello,” I say, returning my attention to the mess, hoping like hell he
doesn't see how red my cheeks are right now because I am definitely
thinking about things I shouldn't be.
“Hello? That's all I get?”
“Yes.”
He laughs and walks farther into the truck, the vehicle creaking under
his feet. His shoes come into view before his hand does. He tucks a single
finger under my chin, pulling my face up to meet his.
“That's all I get?” he repeats, his voice deep and husky, sending a shiver
through me.
Like my body is moving of its own accord, I rise to stand. Without a
word, Miller hauls me closer, sealing his lips over mine.
Sprinkles crunch under our shoes, and I'm acutely aware that we're
standing in the middle of my truck where everyone can see us, but I don't
care, not when he's holding me like he is, not when his lips feel so good
against mine.
I'm getting attached to him. Dangerously so.
But I can't help it. Being with Miller feels so good, so right.
He hasn't told me he loves me again, so I'm definitely chalking that up
to his sleepy brain, but I'm dying to hear him utter those words again.
And that fucking scares me.
I have no idea how long we stand locked together because when he's
kissing me, it feels like time is standing still. Not until someone clears their
throat do I snap back to reality.
We pull apart, and I turn toward the window to find a very amused
Harper and Ryan staring at us.
“Well, I have to say, I did not expect this,” Harper says.
“I don't know, they were kind of giving off vibes at the fundraiser,”
Ryan tells her. “It's the romantic in me—I see things like this.”
“Do you, though? I'm pretty sure I was the one who had to tell you that
you were in love with your own husband.”
“Well, technically…”
Harper rolls her eyes at her best friend. “Technicalities, my ass.”
“Are you two finished?” Miller interrupts them.
Ryan laughs. “That's rich coming from you, Mr. Attack Her Mouth.”
“I didn't attack her. I kissed her, and she liked it.”
All three of them look at me like they're waiting for me to confirm or
deny it.
“I did like it,” I tell them.
“Ha! See!” Miller says.
I glare at him. “Go away. I have customers.”
“Ugh. Fine.” He throws his hands in the air. “I'll go see what Macie's
up to.”
“She wants tickets to one of your games, in case you didn't hear that
earlier.”
“Tickets? Hell yeah I'll get her tickets. I'll go work it out with Stevie.”
He takes off out the back of the truck, and I don't miss the Chocolate
Nutty Butter donut he steals on his way through.
“Ladies,” he says to the girls as he walks past them.
They eye him as he stalks away, and the minute he's out of earshot, they
begin peppering me with questions.
“When did this happen?”
“Are you two dating?”
“Is Miller really a good kisser?”
“Does this mean you're going to be coming to the games now?”
“Is his dick really—”
I hold my hand up, halting that last question from Ryan.
“Okay, fine.” She lifts her hands. “Too far. But…” I lift my brow in
warning. “Does this mean you're going to come to games? You're a WAG
now, and we cool ones have to stick together. Some of the others are just
so…”
“It feels like high school all over again,” Harper explains.
Ryan nods. “Yes! Like that. Except worse because they all have money
and look like clones.”
“It's eerie even for me,” Harper says. And that really is saying
something considering she makes horror-themed stuff for a living. Eerie is
her specialty.
“I'm assuming a WAG has something to do with dating?”
Harper nods. “Wives and girlfriends.”
“Ah, gotcha.”
“If you decide to come, great. You're definitely welcome. And if not,
that's okay too. We know hockey games aren't everyone's scene. Hell, I
didn't even like the sport until I met Collin.”
“And now you're reciting stats in your sleep.”
“Oh my god, Ryan, that was one time!” Harper says. “Besides, you've
done your makeup witchcraft and turned yourself into how many hockey
mascots now?”
“Mind your business.” Ryan sticks her tongue out.
I laugh.
Maybe I should go to a game with them. I'm not sure a hockey game is
really my scene, but it could be fun, and if nothing else, it'll be good book
research.
Not tonight, though. Tonight, all I want to do is go home and write,
especially since Macie interrupted me just when it was getting good.
“I won't be able to make the game tonight, but maybe the next one?”
Harper claps her hands together. “Yay!”
She gives me the details, and we make plans to meet up at her house so
we can all drive over together for their next home game in two days.
With a promise to text them, I hand them their usual orders, and they
say their goodbyes, making sure to scold Miller on their way out for not
telling them about us.
“They're kind of scary sometimes,” Miller says, coming back to the
truck and leaning against the counter.
I laugh. “I think they're sweet.”
“Did you guys make plans for a game?” I eye him. “What?” He shrugs.
“I wasn't listening in the whole time.”
“Just most of it.”
He has the decency to at least look embarrassed. “I won't lie, I'm
excited as fuck to see you at my game. You're going to wear my jersey,
right?”
“You mean the one you tried to literally rip off my body, but all you
ended up doing was giving me a burn?”
“I said I was sorry! And I kissed it better. Besides, it's not my fault they
make it look so easy to rip off someone's clothes in movies.”
I shake my head. “Has anyone told you lately that you're exhausting?”
“You did just last night.”
I blush, thinking about what happened after he got back from being
away. They won five to nothing, and a celebration was definitely in order
after a shutout.
I tried to tell him it should have been me rewarding him for such an
amazing night, but he insisted me sitting on his face was his reward. I
wasn't about to complain about that.
“Are we still on for our date tomorrow?”
“Yes, sir. Six?”
“Oh, say that again.”
I crinkle my nose. “Six?”
“No. The sir part.”
“I am not calling you sir.”
“Hmm…I don't know. I'm liking the way it sounds.”
“Miller…” I groan. “Go away before I do something ludicrous like
listen to you.”
He laughs. “All right, fine. I'm going.” He leans across the counter,
pressing a kiss to my cheek before walking away backward. “I'll see you
tomorrow?”
“Yes, sir,” I tease.
He pauses, tipping his head to the side, just staring at me with those
liquid gold eyes of his.
There's something in them I haven't seen before, something I can't
quite place my finger on. Whatever it is, it makes me tingle from my toes to
my fingertips, and not even in a sexy way.
It's something else.
Something different.
Something good.
“What is it?” I ask him, unable to take it any longer.
“It's…” He shakes his head softly like he's rousing himself from a
dream. “It's nothing.”
“You sure?”
“Yep. See you tomorrow!” he calls over his shoulder as he spins on his
heel and practically jogs to the parking lot.
What the hell just happened?
20
MILLER
I've come to a definitive conclusion: I am in love with Scout Thomas.
At first, I thought maybe my feelings for her were just clouded by a
haze of incredible sex, and perhaps I was getting ahead of myself, but that's
not the case at all.
Not by a long shot.
Yesterday when we were at the truck saying goodbye, I just looked at
her and knew I wasn't going crazy, knew I wasn't jumping too far ahead.
Sure, I've only really known her since this summer, but that's just it—I
know Scout. And she knows me.
I know that I'm in love with her.
And I plan to tell her tonight…if I can figure out how.
Which is precisely why I'm standing outside her door, trying to
convince myself to knock. I haven't ever felt this damn nervous in my life.
Hell, not even the Stanley Cup Final was this nerve-wracking.
Blowing out a steadying breath, I rap my knuckles against the door and
wait.
Roughly four seconds later, the door creaks open, and Scout's face fills
the gap.
“You made it!” she says as she pulls the door open all the way. “You're
early too.”
“Yeah, we got done with videos early, so I figured I'd just head this
way. I…” My words trail off as I get a look at what she's wearing.
Her hair is wrapped in a towel, and she's wearing a pair of shorts and a
sports bra.
“Woman…” I growl, rushing into the apartment and closing the door
behind me. “What the hell are you doing opening the door like that?”
She rolls her eyes, pulling the towel off her head and wringing her hair
out into it. “Relax. People wear these things to the gym all the time.”
Well, she has me there, but I still don't like it.
“I told you!” Stevie calls.
“Yes, and I ignored you,” Scout yells at her sister. She turns back to me
with a grin. “Hi.” She kisses my cheek. “I'm so glad you're here.”
“I'm glad I'm here too.”
“Come on, I'll show you around.”
“Hey, Grady,” Stevie says from the island in the kitchen as we make our
way farther into the apartment. “Please ignore the mess. People live here.”
I laugh. “It's fine. I don't mind one bit.” I hand over the bouquet of
flowers I'm holding. “These are for you ladies.”
“Shut up!” she says, taking them from me. “This is really sweet of you.
I'll grab a vase. I hope I don't kill them before dinner with Dad, because
they'd make a great centerpiece.”
I make a mental note to buy another bouquet for the dinner I've been
invited to next week just in case.
Stevie hops down off the stool and retrieves a vase from a cabinet,
getting to work arranging them.
I peek around the apartment that I'm pretty sure could fit into my living
room and kitchen. The building it's in is older, but the apartment looks
newly renovated with sleek hardwood floors and granite countertops. It's
nice.
Stevie isn't lying—people do live in it, and that's obvious from all the
knickknacks lying around and the backpack slung across the floor. It looks
like a home, unlike my apartment, which sometimes feels like a museum. I
don't spend much time there, especially during the season, so it's hard to
even get it messy, but still. I much prefer this cozy space to the one I have.
With my schedule and Scout's, it's always easier to spend time at my
apartment than here so we don't disturb Stevie or Macie. This is the first
time everything worked out where we can be at her place, and I already
don't want to leave.
It's just a bonus that tonight is the famous mac and cheese night I've
heard so much about.
“Dinner smells great,” I tell Macie, who is standing on a small stepstool
at the stove, stirring the noodles. “What's the secret ingredient today?”
“It's hot dogs and baked beans!”
I want to curl my lips up, but at the last second, I remember I'm talking
to a nine-year-old who sounds more excited than I've ever been about
anything before, so I force a smile.
“It sounds…great.”
“It actually is,” Scout says quietly from beside me. “At first, I had the
same thought you're having right now, but it was actually way better than I
thought it would be.”
“Guess you're getting another of my firsts,” I say to her, winking.
She giggles, then grabs my hand. “Let me show you my room while I
finish getting dressed.”
I follow her through the apartment, and the minute she tugs me into her
room and slams the door shut behind her, I'm on her. I cage her in from
behind, pressing up against the door. I slip my hand around her throat,
arching her head back as my lips find her earlobe. I bite down, and she lets
out a gasp.
“You look fucking edible,” I tell her quietly. A moan slips free when I
nibble my way from that spot below her ear she loves to her shoulder.
“You're killing me in this.”
There's no way she doesn't feel that I mean it. My cock is straining so
fucking hard against my jeans, and I have half a mind to rip this skimpy
outfit from her body and fuck her until she's screaming my name just for
being a little tease.
But I can't. We're not alone.
Instead, I do a little teasing of my own, slipping my hand around her
and cupping her through the skintight cotton shorts, pressing my thumb
against her clit.
“What I wouldn't give to taste this pretty cunt of yours right now…”
“Grady…” she whines. “Please.”
The single word has me spinning her around and dropping to my knees
in front of her, tugging her shorts down along the way. I don't waste a
single second, shoving my tongue between her legs for a quick taste.
Fuck, she's sweet. The greatest thing I've ever had. I could do this
forever. Could spend an eternity tasting her and making her scream.
But right now, as badly as I want to, I can't.
I pull away, tugging her shorts back up and pressing a quick kiss to her
lips before putting two feet of distance between us.
It takes her a second to realize what's happening—or more accurately,
what isn't happening.
When she peels her eyes open, there's no mistaking the fire in her eyes.
She's annoyed she's been played.
“You're the worst,” she seethes.
“What'd I do?”
She glowers, brushing past me and marching to her closet. She yanks a
shirt off the hanger and puts it on angrily.
I laugh the whole time as she stomps out of her room and back toward
the bathroom, all while pushing my hard cock down because she's not the
only one who wishes we were alone right now.
I take a real look at her bedroom for the first time and, right away, I
notice there are books everywhere. They're on the shelves that line the
walls, and there are literal stacks of them on the floor. It's already a small
space, so all the books in here make it feel even smaller, but it doesn't
matter because it just screams Scout.
I love it. I love her.
I continue my perusal. There are a few pictures on the wall. Two older
men—one I recognize as her dad and the other I assume is Pops—are in one
photo with their arms slung around her. She's wearing a cap and gown; it
must be her graduation. There are several of her and Macie and Stevie, plus
a few of her with people I don't recognize but am going to assume are
authors based on the backgrounds.
I scan the spines of the many books that fill the shelves. Most of them
sound like romance titles, but a few are something entirely different,
making me wonder if they're hers too or someone else's.
When I accidentally bump into the small writing desk in the corner, her
open laptop comes to life, and a Word document is pulled up on the screen.
I shouldn't look.
I know that.
But I can't help the few words that catch my eye.
Hockey.
Virgin.
What the hell…
I lay my fingers on the mouse and scroll.
There are at least a hundred and fifty pages, and so many familiar things
stick out to me as I fly through the document to get to the beginning.
Once I do, I freeze.
Pucked by the Virgin [Working Title] by Scout Thomas
I begin to read, and as the pages go on, there's one thing that's
abundantly clear: This book is about us.
“What the hell are you doing?”
I jump, slamming the laptop shut and spinning around to find a very
angry Scout standing in the doorway. She flies into the room and right past
me, scooping up her computer and hugging it close to her chest.
“This is private, Miller! You had no right!” Her cheeks are red, and her
eyes are glowing with rage.
Something I find very funny considering what I was just reading on her
laptop. It sounded like a fanfiction about her scoring with the virgin of an
NHL team.
Only it's not a fanfiction because it happened.
What the hell is happening?
“I'm sorry, but I had no right?” I ask, pointing to myself. “You wrote a
fucking book about me, Scout. About us.”
“It's not about us.”
“Really? Because it sure as shit looked like it to me.”
“Who cares if it is?” She laughs derisively. “This whole thing was just
an experiment for you anyway. You wanted to lose your virginity, so you
picked the easy target, the girl who was crushing on you and wouldn't turn
you down. This isn't going to last, and you know it.”
My jaw slackens, and everything inside of me aches to the bone. “Is…is
that what you think about us?”
She tips her chin up but doesn't say anything.
The longer we stand here, the angrier I become.
“Has this all just been a game to you? Has everything we've been doing
over the last few months just been research for your book? Using me? Like
my fucking parents did?”
There's a flash of hurt in her eyes at my accusations, but she still
doesn't say anything.
My chest feels like there's an elephant standing on it, and I can't seem
to catch my breath.
I opened up to her as I'd never done before. I told her things nobody
else knows about me…about my family.
I thought this was going to last.
There's a knock on the door that drags our attention.
“Uh, hey,” Stevie says, pushing it open. “We can hear you, FYI.”
She looks between us, then stares at Scout for a long, long time. I've
seen that look before from my parents—it's disappointment.
With one last glance my way, Stevie pulls the door shut.
I look back over at Scout, but she's not looking at me. She's staring
down at the computer tucked tightly to her chest.
I don't like it. I don't like that she's not seeing how fucking hurt I am
right now because I'm really hurt. This wasn't what I was expecting from
her. I know she's been guarded with me, know she's been hurt in the past,
but this? This isn't what I thought would come of this.
I step toward her, and only then does she finally look up.
“I have news for you, Scout.” Her hazel eyes meet mine as she bites
down on her bottom lip. “This wasn't a game to me. This wasn't about
losing my virginity. This was real for me. I trusted you. I fell for you.” I
swallow hard, cupping the back of my neck and squeezing because that
damn tension is back. “I fucking fell for you. I…I love you, but all I am to
you is a plot point.”
Her jaw drops, but nothing comes out.
She doesn't refute my words. She doesn't tell me I'm wrong. She just
stands there in silence, and I swear it hurts worse than taking one of
Wright's slapshots to the boot.
I have no clue how long we stand there, how long she stares at me wideeyed, how long she keeps not saying a word…
But it's long enough for me to know one thing—I'm right, and I've
never hated it more.

SCOUT
I've somehow managed to piss off everyone in my life that I care about in
the last week.
Macie? According to her, I ruined the magic of mac and cheese night.
Stevie? She's giving me the silent treatment because she heard the entire
thing.
Rosie? I snapped at her this morning and sent her home for the day, then
closed the truck early.
And Miller? Well, that one is obvious.
He told me he loves me, and I stood there. I was frozen, completely
taken aback.
Sure, he's said it to me before, but that time he was in a post-sex sleep
haze. It didn't mean anything.
This time, he was wide awake and not freshly fucked.
And he meant every damn word.
I can't believe he found my stupid book. I snort a laugh because it's not
even really a book; it's a writing exercise I've been doing, a silly fluff piece
that's supposed to help get my brain moving. I've been doing an online
course for creative writing, and one of the suggestions was to start a story
that was pure fluff, something fun and off the cuff. I started writing about
the virgin hockey player and the bookworm because it was a great trope and
because it still blows my mind that he could possibly be interested in me.
But it's completely fictional. Sure, the character looks like him and
plays hockey and is a virgin and the heroine reads romance novels, but
that's it. Nothing else in the book is about him or us or anything we've done
together. It's completely made up and means nothing to me.
Miller didn't let me explain that, though. He just got upset and dropped
a massive three-word bomb on me then left.
Macie cried for half an hour because she thought it was the combination
of hot dogs and baked beans that made him leave. When I told her it was
my fault he left and not hers, she stopped speaking to me.
Her mother followed suit soon after, which is why Stevie is now angrily
cleaning the kitchen as I mope on the couch, watching The Princess Diaries
movies over and over again because they remind me of Miller.
She slams the cabinet closed for the third time, and it grates on my
nerves just a little bit more. I turn up the volume on the TV.
She slams it even louder. Then, I swear to God, she gets a pot out and
begins banging it with a wooden spoon.
I've officially had enough.
“Stop!”
She bangs on the pot harder. “No!”
“Knock it off, Stevie. You're being childish!” I yell back.
“Me? I'm being childish?” I hear her stomp across the apartment. She
doesn't stop until she's standing directly in front of the TV. She reaches
behind the flat screen and yanks the cord out of the wall, her chest heaving
with anger as she stands there with her hands on her hips. “You're the one
acting like a mopey teenager right now, which is absolutely hilarious when
you think about it because you're not the one with a broken heart.”
“Then why does it feel like I am?” I scream.
The words fly out of my mouth before I even realize what I'm saying.
“Why does it feel this way?” I whisper.
I was hurt when Aaron cheated on me. Hell, it fucking broke my heart,
but it felt different than this. I felt betrayed and embarrassed.
With Miller…it's anguish.
Stevie sighs heavily, then drops down onto the couch next to me. She
pats my thigh. “Because you love him, you idiot.”
For the first time since Miller walked out of this apartment a week ago,
I cry—full-on, body-shaking, snotty crying. It's ugly and awful and makes
me feel like garbage, but I deserve it because I made Miller feel the same
way because I'm too freaking scared to admit I am hopelessly in love with
him.
Stevie shoves tissues at me, then hands me a glass of water. She wraps a
blanket around my shoulders as I gulp it down, then she takes the empty
cup and sets it on the table. She sits back down next to me and pats her
thighs.
I lay my head on her lap just like I used to when we were kids, and she
runs her fingers through my hair in soothing strokes. I don't know how long
we sit like that in the silence, but it's long enough for my shakes to subside.
“You know,” Stevie says after a while, “I guess I'm just surprised.
You've had a crush on him for like two years or something. How is this not
what you always wanted?”
“That's just it, Stevie—it was a crush, a harmless, silly, schoolgirl crush.
He's the jock. I'm the bookworm. We make no sense together. My crush
was safe because it was fantasy.”
“But now it's not. It's real.”
“Yes.” I groan, pushing off her lap and sitting up, tugging the blanket
tighter around me. Maybe if I wrap myself up tightly enough, it'll act as a
shield and protect me from the absolute heartache I'm feeling right now.
“It's so fucking real, and I don't know if I'm ready for it to be real.”
Stevie frowns, and I hate it because it's full of pity.
“You want to know what I think?”
“No.”
“I think you're being stupid.”
“I said I didn't want to hear it.”
“Well, tough shit, because I'm going to say it. You're being stupid,
Scout. This man loves you. Like loves you.”
“Don't forget that he didn't even know who I was just earlier this
summer.”
“No.” She points at me. “Don't do that. If you told him you forgive him,
you actually need to forgive him. You're not allowed to keep bringing it
back up. Besides, if you think he doesn't regret not paying attention to you
for the last several years, you're sorely mistaken. The way you look at one
another…” She shakes her head with a small laugh. “It reminds me of Dad
and Pops.”
I know she doesn't say that lightly. Our dads had a love story for the
ages, meeting young and losing touch, then reconnecting years later. Their
story was always one of my favorites to hear, and I'd beg Pops to tell it to
me.
If Stevie is right and Miller loves me even a fraction of how much Dad
and Pops loved each other, it's a hell of a lot.
“Do you love him, Scout?”
I swallow back the lump in my throat and nod. “So much. I think I fell
for him the minute he walked onto the lot.”
“Then tell him. However you need to do it, tell him. Don't let it pass
you by. You deserve the kind of happily ever after you're always reading
about, the kind you've always wanted to write.”
Her words strike something inside of me, and I rise from the couch,
dropping my blanket shield.
“Where are you going?” Stevie asks as I march to my bedroom.
“To write.”
She lets out a loud “Woohoo!” as I sit down at my desk and take a deep
breath.
Then, I open my laptop…and I write.
“Hey, Scout, I'm taking my first ten!” Rosie calls from inside the truck.
Keeping one hand on the keyboard, I lift the other and wave so she
knows I heard her.
I'm surprised I mustered even that.
For the last few days, my laptop has been attached to me, practically
becoming another limb. I've barely made time to eat and sleep. It's safe to
say I trust Rosie with the truck because even when I am here, I'm not truly
present.
My whole life has revolved around this book. I'm addicted to the
characters, to the way they make me feel. I channel it all into the story, all
my heartbreaks and my pain, every single up and down I've felt over the
years.
And, more than anything, I pour love into it. My love for baking, for
writing.
For Miller.
Even though I've been immersed in a fictional world and have fallen in
love with fictional characters, my love for him hasn't waned. If anything,
it's grown stronger. I miss him so badly. Every day he doesn't show up at
the truck is another day my heart aches, but I know I need this time. I need
it not just to finish my book but to find the woman I lost over the last three
years. It sucks to be away from Miller, but it's necessary too. I don't love
who I am right now, so how can I be expected to love him the way he
deserves?
“What are you writing there?”
I jump at the sudden intrusion then spin around to find my dad standing
a few feet away.
“Dad!” I rise from the bench and throw my arms around his neck.
He's startled by my reaction, and I am too. It's not that I don't always
love seeing my father—I do, but I don't usually react so strongly like this.
I think deep down, I've been needing him. He was understanding during
the dinner Miller missed when I told him he couldn't make it because of
hockey. I hated lying to him, but I didn't want to get into the real reason he
wasn't joining us. I think Stevie told him anyway, but true to my father's
nature, he stayed out of it until I was ready.
He must have known today was that day.
My dad squeezes me back, hugging me so tight I struggle to catch my
breath. When he finally releases me, I don't even realize I'm crying until he
reaches out and wipes a stray tear from my cheek.
“How's my girl doing?”
“Not good, Dad,” I say on a sniffle. “I feel…rotten.”
“Rotten?”
I nod. “Like from the inside out. Just…I feel all wrong. The only thing
keeping me going is finishing this book.”
His eyes light up at my words. “As sorry as I am that you're hurting,
I'm glad you have something to help you keep pushing through.”
“Me too.” I sniffle again, annoyed by the way my eyes start to sting.
I've cried over Miller a lot in the last few weeks, and it's no one's fault but
my own.
“You, uh, want to talk about it?” Dad asks, shoving his hands into his
pockets, tipping his head to the side.
“I think I'd like that.” The words surprise even me. “I'll grab us some
coffees.”
I head for the truck, and my first stop is to grab a napkin and clean up
my face from crying. I pour us two iced coffees and grab some donuts then
set the Be Right Back sign out so Rosie can keep enjoying her break.
When I get back, Dad is not-so-subtly reading what's on my screen.
I'm not even mad, mostly because I'm proud as hell of what I'm
writing. For the first time in a really long time, it feels right.
I set our drinks and snacks on the table, sliding in across from him.
When he finally peels his eyes from the screen and looks up at me, there are
tears brimming them.
“This…” He clears his throat. “This is amazing, Scout.”
“You think so?”
He nods, taking a sip of his coffee. “Yes. The best you've written to
date, if I do say so.”
“I think so too, but you're not just saying that because you're my dad,
are you?”
“Nah. If it were trash, I'd give it to you straight. We both know that.”
I chuckle, because he really would.
We eat our donuts in silence for a few minutes before Dad finally asks
the question I've been dreading.
“What happened with Miller?”
I set my donut down with a sigh then laugh because, without even
realizing it, I picked up Miller's favorite.
“I messed up.”
“You messed up?” Dad asks, one bushy brow raised.
“I…I closed myself off from him just when things started getting real. I
told him we didn't have a future together, said it meant more to him than it
did me…and when he looked me in the eyes and told me he loved me, I
didn't say a word.”
Dad winces. “Ouch.”
“Yeah.” I nod. “Ouch indeed.” I groan, scrubbing my hand over my
face. “Am I broken?”
“If you're broken, I'm broken too.”
“What do you mean?”
Dad sighs and rests his arms on the table, leaning forward. “I mean,
we're a lot more alike than you may believe. I know you and Pops always
had this incredible bond, and I loved that for both of you because you and I
had our things too, but what I mean this time is this”—he waves his hand
between us—“right now, this…we push people away. People we care about,
people we love. And we do it because we're scared of getting hurt. Hell, I
did it years ago with Pops when we lost touch for all those years, and I'm
doing it now because he was unfairly taken away too early, so I'm pissed
about it and sulking.”
“We have reasons to be cautious, though.”
He nods. “You're right. We do, but at what point is that impeding on
who we are as people? At what point does that become who we are? How
does that shape our lives? We can't hide forever. You can't hide forever,
Scout.”
I gulp because he's right. I can't keep hiding. Especially not when I
know now what it feels like to truly live.
And that's all because of Miller.
“How do we get better?” I ask him.
“Time. Practice. Finding the right people who will help us.” He blows
out a heavy breath. “That's kind of why I came here today, actually.”
“Okay…” I draw the word out, not quite sure what he's getting at.
He lifts his hand and strokes his beard a few times, then says, “I met
someone.”
His words send so many emotions through me: shock, anger, and
happiness just to name a few. I wasn't expecting him to say that, mostly
because I didn't realize he was even looking for someone.
“I didn't know you were dating,” I say carefully.
“I'm not. Not yet, anyway. But, uh, he asked, and…”
“You said yes.”
“I said yes.” He takes another drink of his coffee, and I don't miss the
way his hand shakes.
He's nervous to tell me this. Why?
“I know you loved Pops, and you know I loved Pops too, so damn much
that even three years later, it still hurts like we lost him just yesterday.
But…I've been hiding, holed up in that house that reminds me of him,
doing all the things we used to do together, which also just reminds me of
him. I need something different if I'm ever going to move on. And I do
need to move on.” He reaches across the table, gripping my hand tightly.
“It's time, Scout. For both of us.”
There's a ridiculous, childish part of me that hates the idea of him
moving on, that feels like he's betraying Pops by doing so. It's wrong, and I
know that.
He loves Pops. He'll always love him. But he can't be alone forever,
and Pops wouldn't want that either.
“I'm happy for you, Dad,” I tell him, meaning every word. His face
lights up at my statement, and I think he needed to hear it more than he
realizes. “I think this will be really good for you.”
“It can be good for you too, you know. I know losing Pops was hard,
and then that little dickhead Aaron broke your heart, but we can't keep
letting that hold us back. We have lives to live, adventures to have. We have
people who want to be loved by us. We need to go experience all of that.”
The more he talks, the more I know what he's saying is exactly what I
need.
“You're right.”
“Of course I'm right. I'm your dad.”
He winks, and I laugh. It's a good laugh, one I really needed.
“For what it's worth, I'm happy for you too. I think this”—he dips his
head toward my laptop—“will be really good for you. And so will Miller,
whenever you're ready.”
I blow out a steadying breath. “I think you may be right about that too.”
“I am,” he says confidently. He grabs his coffee and sucks down the rest
of it then pushes to his feet. “I'm going to get out of here and let you get
back to writing.”
“You don't have to go.”
What I don't say is that I am itching to get back to writing. I didn't write
for three years, and now I have a book pouring out of me so fast I'm getting
whiplash from it.
“I do. I have a date to prepare for, and you have work to do.” He lifts his
brows pointedly, and I have a feeling the work he's talking about isn't just
my writing.
“Okay.”
I stand and meet him at the end of the table, and he wraps me in one of
his hugs again. This time, I don't cry.
This time, I feel refreshed.
I feel ready.

MILLER
Normally I'd head to Scout's truck after practice, but that's not really an
option right now.
So here I am, walking toward Wright, Rhodes, and Lowell with a tray in
my hand, hoping like hell I can use them as a distraction because I badly
need one.
“So, then,” Wright says as I take a seat, “his boyfriend looks at me and
goes, ‘Oh, you're not William.'”
All the guys laugh, but I'm completely confused as to what's going on.
“What are you guys talking about?” I ask.
“Wright's brother is in town and brought his boyfriend along with him.
They're staying over at his and Harper's place,” Harkens, one of our other
teammates, explains. “Wright came home from practice yesterday, and the
boyfriend answered the door with his lips puckered up for a kiss, thinking it
was Wright's brother.”
“No shit?” I chuckle. “What'd you do?”
“I kissed him,” Wright answers with a shrug. “I couldn't leave the guy
hanging.”
Everyone laughs again.
“Harper asked me all night long who the better kisser is, him or her.”
“And?” Rhodes asks.
Wright smirks. “I told her it was a tie just to fuck with her. She hasn't
talked to me all morning. I can't wait for makeup sex later.”
“You're crazy, man,” Harkens says, rising from his chair and clapping
Wright on the back. “I'm out of here. Got to get home—my kid is potty
training, and based on the text from my wife, let's just say there's a mess
waiting for me when I get there.”
Harkens and a few other guys take off, leaving me with just Wright,
Rhodes, and Lowell.
“So, what's up with you lately, Miller?” Rhodes takes a drink of his
Gatorade, eying me.
“Yeah, I feel like you haven't really been around to annoy us,” Lowell
says.
“I heard he has a girlfriend,” Wright tells them.
“That so?” Rhodes shoots his eyes my way. “Anyone we know?”
I roll my eyes because it's clear they know about Scout and me, and I
assume they heard it from their wives. I guess they missed the rest of the
story, though.
“Ha, ha. You're all a bunch of comedic geniuses.”
“I think we're fucking hilarious,” Lowell deadpans.
I grunt, stabbing at the pasta on my plate and shoveling a bite into my
mouth.
“Uh-oh. Trouble in paradise already?” Rhodes asks.
“Huh?” I look up.
He nods toward my food. “You just stabbed that pasta so hard you bent
your fork.”
I look down at the metal utensil in my hand, and sure enough, it's bent.
I'm not entirely surprised, though. I'm angry. So damn mad. How the
fuck could Scout say we meant nothing to her and there's no future for us?
How could she just stand there and stare at me when I poured my heart out
to her?
It hurts really fucking bad.
“You okay, man?” Lowell asks, caution lacing his voice.
I toss my now useless silverware down with a sigh, running a hand over
my face. It's been a long two weeks, and I'm tired. Every time I lie down in
bed and close my eyes, all I can see is Scout standing there staring at me
like I'm insane as I confess that I'm in love with her. I've been running on
about four hours of sleep a night, and I'm barely eating enough to have the
energy to skate.
It's not good for a lot of reasons. I need to get my shit together and fast.
“Miller?” Wright prompts when I don't say anything. There's worry
laced in the single word, and fuck if it doesn't make me feel some shit I
really don't want to right now. “You can talk to us, you know. About
anything.”
I know that. I do. It's just…I don't know if I want to talk about this
because it sucks so bad.
But they've all been here before. Maybe they'll know what I should do.
“I'm a virgin,” I blurt out. Then I laugh sardonically. “Well, not
anymore I'm not, but I was…until Scout. Greer knew, and the fucked-up
thing is that I didn't even know I liked her until he flirted with her, and I
hated it because I wanted it to be me flirting with her. Then one thing led to
another, and now we're having sex, and it's great and not the problem at all.
The problem is I'm in love with her, and I told her, and she said nothing.
This was after I found out she's been writing a fucking book about us. I'm
not even that upset about that part. I'm more pissed about the fact that I laid
it all out there for her, and she just stood there, looking at me like I'm the
asshole for having the audacity to fall in love with her. But can I really be
blamed? She's amazing. She's smart and gorgeous and does this really cute
thing where she mimics all the facial expressions the characters do when
she's reading her books, and I just really, really love spending time with her,
and it's all I want to do. I'm…” I suck in a sharp breath then exhale. “I'm
hopelessly fucking in love with her and yet still so damn upset with her.”
There's a hushed silence that falls over the table. I don't want to look
up; I'm too scared to see the expressions on their faces.
But I'm curious too.
I sneak a glance at Rhodes and—holy fuck. Is he smiling?
I look at Wright and Lowell, and they're doing the same thing.
“What?” I ask.
They all burst out laughing.
Wright grabs his water bottle off his tray and takes a big drink, shaking
his head. “You're definitely in love, dude.”
“I know. That's what I said.”
“Yeah, but like, you're really in love,” Rhodes tells me.
“I know,” I say again.
“Like really, really in love.”
“I fucking know!” I practically yell. It pulls the attention of someone
walking by, and I sink lower into my seat. “I know,” I repeat, this time
quieter. “What do I do? What if she doesn't love me back?”
Nobody says anything for a long time, and I fucking hate it because it
makes all the fears I have that much more real.
“Harper didn't love me. At least not right away,” Wright confesses. “I
fell for her first.”
“Really?”
He nods. “Yeah. It, uh, definitely took some time for her to reciprocate
those feelings. It hurt to hear at first, I won't lie. Like really fucking hurt.
I'd rather take ten puck hits from Beast than ever feel that shit again.”
“That's how I feel right now. Like I'm bruised and broken, and
everything just feels…wrong. Is that weird?”
The guys all shake their heads.
“I'm so mad at her and love her so much at the same time. Is that
weird?”
“No, man. It sucks, but that's love sometimes,” Wright says.
“What did you do in the meantime? When it took Harper time to come
around, I mean.”
“I waited for her.” He shrugs. “She was worth it, so I waited.”
“How? How did you just wait?”
He chuckles. “Fuck, man. I'm not really sure because it honestly about
killed me. But I knew I had to give her the space she needed to figure out
what she wanted, how she really felt about me. Luckily, in the end,
everything worked out, but…”
I gulp. “I need to figure out how to move on if she doesn't love me
back.”
He nods solemnly, a grimace on his face.
I hate it, absolutely loathe the possibility that he could be right, that I
might just have to accept that Scout will never feel the same way for me as
I feel for her.
But…I don't believe that's true. I know her. I can read her easily.
There's no way this is a one-sided thing. She has feelings for me; I know it.
Maybe Wright is right. Maybe all she does need is time.
And I guess that's what I'm going to have to give her.
“Can we circle back to that virgin thing and why the fuck Greer knew
about it before us?” Rhodes asks, and we all laugh, the tension dissipating.
So, I tell them everything.
“Mr. Miller?”
I turn to find one of our security guards waiting for me in the parking
garage. We just got out of a game we won no thanks to me. I haven't been
able to score in weeks. Can't remember the last fucking time I shot a puck
and it didn't sail about three feet outside the goalie's crease.
I'm off my game. The team knows it, and Coach knows it too. It looks
bad, and if I keep this shit up, I'm screwed. I can tell Coach is about one
game away from dropping my ice time, and I really don't want to lose it. I
might be sucking out there, but hockey is the only thing keeping me sane
right now. I need the push, need the burn and the pain. I need something to
keep me going because I'm really starting to feel like it's hopeless to keep
waiting on Scout.
“Hey, Dom. What's up?”
“Someone dropped this off for you.” He holds a huge yellow envelope
my way.
I look down at it then back at him. “What is it?”
“I'm not sure.” He shrugs. “I mean I opened it to make sure it wasn't
dangerous, but it's just a bunch of pages with typing on them. I didn't read
them all, though,” he rushes out.
“Okay…” I say, taking the envelope from his outstretched palm.
“Thanks,” I mutter.
“No problem. Have a good night, Mr. Miller.”
I stare at the heavy package the entire way to my car. Hell, I'm so
preoccupied with it and what it could be, I even walk past my car.
When I get inside, I decide to wait to open it, tossing it onto my
passenger seat and throwing the car in drive.
I make it two miles before I'm pulling off into a random lot. When I
look up to see where I am, I laugh.
Of fucking course.
The dirty, ripped screen of the old drive-in taunts me…but not as much
as the envelope.
I pick it up and tear it open. I know instantly what it is and who it's
from, and it makes my heart ache because I miss her.
It's been almost a month since I saw her last, which is too damn long if
you ask me.
Everyone's getting ready for the Christmas break. They're all fucking
holly and jolly, and I've never felt more like the Grinch in my entire life. If
you'd asked me last month what my Christmas plans were, I'd have said I
was going to spend the holiday naked and wrapped up in Scout, but now
I'm going to spend it alone, drowning in vodka and waiting.
I know I need to give her time like Wright said, but it's hard as hell to
stay away. I want to march up to her truck and tell her she's wrong, tell her
the thing between us wasn't something meaningless—tell her it meant
everything.
She means everything.
I told her that, though. She knows how I feel. So now, I wait.
And waiting fucking sucks.
I stare down at the stack of pages and the sticky note on top.
Grady,
This is the book I should have written.
This is how I feel about you.
Yours,
Scout
For a minute, I simply stare at the note, because I am, admittedly, scared.
I'm terrified this is going to be her way of telling me to fuck off because she
doesn't feel the same as I do and she never will, her way of telling me I
need to just move on and this really did mean nothing to her.
But then my eyes track down to her signature.
Yours.
Maybe…just maybe…I have a chance.
And so, I begin to read.
23
SCOUT
The bass of the music thrums through my body, and one thing rings loud
and clear in my head: Hockey games are so not my thing.
“This is amazing!” Macie shouts from beside me, headphones covering
her ears because even to her, this place is too loud. “I love it so much!”
The grin on her face is contagious, and I smile down at her. “I'm glad
you're having fun.”
“What?” she yells.
I laugh, shaking my head.
Miller and I might not be in a good place, but he kept his word to my
niece and got her tickets to his game for Christmas. I didn't let anyone see,
but I cried when I saw his handwriting scrawled across the envelope that
was tucked into the branches of the decorated tree. How he got the tickets to
Stevie, I'm not sure, but I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. Miller has his
ways.
I can't believe it's been a whole month since I've seen him. I miss him
terribly, more than I've ever missed anyone in my life, but I'm also glad
I've taken time away.
I've spent the month writing, and with that have come so many
emotions I wasn't prepared for. At Stevie's insistence, I sought therapy, and
I learned so much about myself, like how I never really grieved the loss of
my father and just buried myself in work and in fantasy to pretend I was
okay.
Along with seeing a therapist, I joined a book club and made new
friends.
I took up knitting. I suck at it, but it's fun.
I tried new restaurants and ate oysters. It was an awful experience, but I
did it.
I lived.
And I feel good. Better than I ever have.
“I can't believe you actually came,” Harper says beside me. “We've
been asking for months and now you're finally here!”
Luckily, even with whatever Miller and I have been going through, the
girls haven't stopped coming by the truck. If anything, they and their
partners have been stopping by more frequently. Even Greer's been coming
once a week. I'm not sure if they're doing it because of Miller, but I
appreciate it either way.
“Do you love it yet?” Ryan asks.
“It's…okay.”
Harper gasps dramatically, Ryan rolls her eyes at her reaction, and I
laugh.
Ryan hitches her thumb toward Harper. “Can you believe this woman
used to hate hockey? Her sister too, and now she has a kid with the
captain.”
“She's made quite the one-eighty,” I say.
“It's wild how much your life can change in such a short amount of
time,” Emilia chimes in with a sly grin. She definitely has the big-lifechange thing down, going from a social media manager to director and
dating one of the former players turned coach.
They've all had big life changes in the last few years. I've watched from
the sidelines as they've gone after what they wanted.
And now…now it's my turn.
The lights dim and the music swells—if that's even possible—as the
players begin to skate out onto the ice for warmups.
“Look! There's Wright!” Macie points. “And Beast! And the captain!”
She's practically standing on her seat to see everyone, though I'm not
sure why. Miller hooked her up with tickets right along the glass.
Wright, Rhodes, and Lowell all skate by, banging their sticks against
said glass right in front of Macie, who squeals with delight. Rhodes even
launches a puck over for her when he sees she's wearing his jersey.
My eyes search the ice, looking for the guy whose number I'm wearing.
“There he is!”
Macie points across the way, and my breath is stolen from my lungs.
He has his skate up on the bench as the equipment manager fixes
something, but he's not paying him any attention.
No.
He's looking at me.
The warmth of his gaze washes over me, and I swear I can feel it down
to my toes. I missed it, missed the way he looks at me like I'm the only
person in the room. Even in this arena filled with thousands of people, I still
feel like it's just us in here.
I missed this feeling more than I've ever missed anything before.
Does he miss it too? Does he miss me? Can he forgive me? Did he read
my book? I wonder if he liked it, if he realized the love story in it is ours.
It's everything I feel for him and more.
I want to ask him that and so many other things, but I can't.
Not yet.
So instead, I lift my hand, and I wave.
I swear I see his lips twitch.
And it's the greatest ounce of joy I've felt in a month.
Game Two
Miller got Macie tickets to more than one game.
This time when I wave to him across the ice during warmups, he nods.
Game Three
He waved back.
And I'm slowly starting to see the appeal of hockey.
Game Four
He smiled.
He smiled, and I fucking melted.
Game Five
Macie hasn't come with me to the last two games. At this point, I'm a legit
Carolina Comets fan.
I love watching the way they glide across the ice, the hits they land, the
way they fight for one another, and, of course, the goals they score.
The team's on a winning streak, and the excitement surrounding it is
infectious. I'm so entranced by the game that it takes a few tries of Harper
tapping on my arm for me to realize someone's trying to get my attention.
“Huh?”
She points up at the big man looming at the end of the aisle.
“Scout?”
“Yes?” I ask, unsure what this is about.
The man, who has the word SECURITY on the front of his shirt, hands
me a sticky note. “This is for you.”
“Thank you,” I mumble, taking the square paper and staring at it in
wonder.
It's the same one I stuck to my manuscript, only now there are two lines
written on the back.
“What is it?” Ryan asks, leaning over Harper to see what's going on.
“It's a note,” Harper tells her, and I hear her add, “I think it's from
Miller.”
I don't join in on their speculation.
I can't. I'm too focused on the words scrawled in black ink.
Meet me after the game.
You know where.

MILLER
I lean against the back of my car, waiting.
We got out of the locker room thirty minutes ago, and I drove straight
here. I'm hoping she's going to show and just got stuck in post-game traffic.
I pick up the bottle of chocolate water and take a swig, hating how much I
love it.
Ten minutes go by.
Twenty.
Thirty.
“Five more minutes,” I promise myself.
But when it comes and goes, my hope begins to fade, and I decide to
call it a night.
I thought maybe with her coming to my games, this might be it, thought
she might be ready.
I could be wrong, and it could just be wishful thinking. Maybe that
damn sticky note was a stupid idea and pushed her even farther away.
I couldn't stop myself from writing it, though.
I fucking miss her.
Seeing her at my game after Christmas, I felt hope for the first time in a
long time. I felt like maybe this wasn't all in my head, like maybe she could
love me too.
Then she came back.
Again and again and again.
And each time I saw her, I felt that pull I have toward her grow even
stronger. I had to do something, even if nothing resulted from it.
It looks like that's what is happening right now.
It's been forty-five minutes.
She's not coming.
I shove off my car with a sigh and head for the driver's side door. Just
as I'm popping it open, headlights swing into view, and I freeze.
Then, I hear the squeal of brakes, and I know.
She came.
Her old, beat-up Toyota rattles into the lot as she pulls up next to me. I
can't see much inside the car thanks to the glare from the headlights, but I
hear her door open, hear her feet hit the pavement and take quick steps
toward me.
She steps in front of the light, and everything in my world feels okay
again.
She's as beautiful as she's always been. Her hair is a little shorter,
hitting just above her shoulders now, and somehow her hazel eyes look
brighter than they ever have, but she still looks like Scout.
My Scout.
“Hello,” she says quietly.
The corners of my mouth twitch. I take a step toward her.
Her breath hitches when I do, so I take another.
And another.
I don't stop until I'm mere inches away, until I can smell that all-toofamiliar scent of sugary sweetness coming off her.
“That's all I get?”
That's all it takes.
I have no idea who grabs who first. All I know is our mouths are fused
together, and I feel whole for the first time in over a month. Her body
presses against mine, and I grip her waist, holding her closer because I'm so
fucking scared she's going to disappear, and I'll wake up, and this will all
have been nothing but a cruel, cruel dream.
I'm not sure when we stop kissing, but we do eventually. We don't
move, though. We stand there, holding on to one another, our lips still
resting against each other.
“Miller…” she says quietly. “I'm sorry.”
I shake my head. “It's okay.”
“It's not.” She pulls her head back to look at me. “I was so dumb. I was
so scared of getting hurt that I didn't let myself even try with you. You
trusted me. You opened up to me. You let me in. You gave yourself to me,
and I just pretended it was nothing. I made you feel like it didn't matter
when it did—when it meant everything. And that stupid book…” She
laughs. “I swear it wasn't about us. It was just a silly writing exercise. I…”
She shakes her head. “I'm just so sorry.”
“It's okay, Scout.” I press my lips to her forehead. “It's okay.”
“How can you say that, Miller? After the hurt I put you through, how
can you say that?”
“Because I love you.”
“You…do?”
I laugh. “Are you kidding me? Of course I do. You're…” I exhale.
“You're everything, Scout. I waited so long to have something that felt
good, something that made me happy and woke me up from the same shit I
was doing over and over. It turns out I was waiting for you.”
She peers up at me, her eyes brimming with tears. “I was there the
whole time, Miller.”
“I know,” I tell her, running my thumb over her cheek. “I know you
were. I'm so sorry I didn't before, but I see you now. I see you, Scout, and
I'm never letting you go.”
“Good, because I don't want you to. This time without you… I missed
you.”
I grin. “I knew you would.”
She laughs, shoving at me playfully. “Glad to see you're still annoying.”
“I'll annoy you forever if you'll let me.”
She sighs, resting her head against my chest. “That sounds…nice.”
“Yeah?”
“Yeah.” She nods then peers up at me. “I, uh, did some soul-searching
while we were apart, and forever doesn't scare me anymore. Not with you.”
Fuck, her words hit me right in the chest. I needed to hear them so much
more than I expected.
“I'm glad because forever with you doesn't scare me either. You weren't
just an experiment, Scout. You could never be that.”
“I know. I'm so sorry I said that. And the book…it was stupid. I wrote
something way better.”
“I know. I read it.”
Her eyes widen. “You did?”
I nod. “Even the sex scenes.” Red tinges her cheeks, and I laugh. “Don't
be embarrassed—they were hot.”
She tries to bury her face in my chest, but I don't let her.
“Don't hide. I loved it, truly. Are you going to publish it?”
She lifts her shoulders. “I'm not sure. I think I want to, but I don't know
the first thing about publishing.”
“I'll help you,” I tell her, and I will. I don't know shit about it either, but
I'll learn for her. “And if you want to submit it to agents, I'll help you with
that too.”
She grins. “You're really something, you know that?”
“I'm the best kind of something.”
She sighs, dropping her head to my chest. “You really are.”
I have no clue how long we stand there with her wrapped in my arms
and me not letting her go. However long it is, I know it's not long enough,
because it never could be.
“Hey, Grady?” she says after a while.
“Hmm?”
“I love you, you know.”
“I knew you couldn't resist me.”
“Ugh,” she groans, trying to shove out of my grasp. “Shut up, Miller.”
I tug her back to me, cupping her face with my hands. “Make me.”
She presses her lips to mine…and she does.
EPILOGUE
Scout
I did it.
I look around the room with a wide smile, proud of everything I've
managed to accomplish over the last year.
Everyone is here to celebrate with me, and I still can't believe this is my
life.
“To Scout!” From beside me, Miller shoots me that grin of his that's
become my favorite thing in the world. “My favorite girl, my favorite donut
maker, and now my favorite published author.” He winks. “I'm so proud of
you, woman.”
“Miller…” I groan, but even with him calling me woman in front of
everyone, I can't seem to wipe the smile off my face.
I don't think I've ever been happier than I am at this moment.
“To Scout!” everyone echoes, lifting their glasses in the air.
I smile at them politely, dying on the inside at all the attention.
When Miller said he was throwing me a party, I laughed it off, but I
should have known he wasn't kidding.
He really wasn't kidding: he rented out an entire room at a hotel that
cost way too much, hired a DJ, got catering, and invited about a hundred
people I don't know. It's over the top and completely ridiculous, but it's all
Miller, which makes me love it.
He wraps his arm around me, pulling me in close. I slide mine around
his neck the best I can.
“I mean it—I'm incredibly proud of you. You published a book and sold
another! Can you believe it?”
“I truly can't.”
That silly story I started about the virgin hockey player? After some
heavy edits, Miller convinced me to keep it and self-publish it under a
pseudonym. I did, then I wrote and published two more with plans for
another three in the series. The sales have been steady, and the reviews are
solid so far. I'm damn proud of my work.
I'm equally proud of the other book my agent sold, the one I sent to
Miller. I started querying right away and somehow managed to land an
agent who was okay with me wanting to be a hybrid author. A month ago, I
got the news I'd been waiting for since I was a kid: my book got picked up
by a publisher.
We just finalized the contract this morning.
“Nobody I know deserves this more than you,” he says. “I hope you
know that.”
“Thank you,” I tell him. “I don't think I could have done it without your
support.”
“Yes, you could have. I know you, Scout—you're a lot more badass
than you give yourself credit for.”
I feel the heat creep into my cheeks. “Well, thank you. You're pretty
badass yourself. I know the season's over, but you guys got so far in the
postseason!”
“Yeah, but we didn't get the Cup.”
“You can't get every Cup. That doesn't mean you didn't kick ass.”
“That goal against Tampa was incredible, huh?” He looks so proud of
himself, as he should be. It's the goal that had them winning the tied series
and moving on to the next round. They ultimately lost in Game Seven, but it
was still a hard-fought series.
“It was pretty hot.”
“Hot, huh?”
“Oh, so hot. You know, when Harper said hockey makes her horny, I
thought she was nuts, but I get it now.”
“Okay, first, I love it when you talk about being horny for me and for
hockey. However, I'd rather not know that information about Harper and
Wright.”
I laugh. “That's fair. That'd be like me getting information about Stevie
and—”
“Ah! No. Stop right there. I don't want to hear that info either.”
“Can you believe they're together?”
“It was the last thing I ever expected, that's for certain.”
“Me too. I thought she was done after Macie's dad, but here she is. Here
they are.”
“Wild year, huh?”
“The wildest,” I agree.
“There's my girl!” my dad shouts, shoving Miller out of the way and
wrapping his arms around me.
I laugh as I hug him back, and Miller stands over my dad's shoulder,
shaking his head with a grin.
“Hey, Dad. Where's Ernesto?”
My dad points over to the dessert table, where his boyfriend is carefully
picking over the sugary treats with Macie. For every treat Ernesto puts on
his plate, he puts one on hers. They're both piled high, and I don't envy
whoever is watching her this evening.
“Peas in a pod, those two,” he comments with a grin on his face. He was
resistant to Ernesto's advances at first and they took it slow, but now they're
inseparable. I know for a fact Ernesto is going to ask my father to move in
with him because he asked for my permission first, something I thought was
unnecessary but still adorable.
“He loves her,” I say, then I peek up at him. “And you.”
“Yeah, I know. He's not the only one falling in love with a Thomas.”
My dad gives Miller a pointed glance then looks over at Stevie, who is
currently in the arms of a Comets player, being dipped backward. “Seems
like we've had a streak of good luck lately, especially you, Little Miss
Published Author. I'm proud of you.”
“Thanks, Dad. I'm proud of me too.”
“And Pops is too.” He puts his hand over his heart. “I can feel it.”
Tears spring to my eyes, but I will myself to not cry. “I feel it too.”
And I mean that. I've continued going to therapy and stepping out of
my comfort zone. I still have times when I want to retreat and times when
the grief is just too much, but I push through it and always make it out okay
on the other side.
Having my books to escape into helps, as does having Miller around. I
hated pushing him away before, but I think it was for the best. I needed to
find myself before I gave a piece of me away to someone else.
“Well, I just wanted to check on you. I'm sure you have to make the
rounds and want to get back to your friends. Ernesto and I are heading out
after he's done with that plate. I'm putting an end to it before he gets sugar
sick like at your first book launch.” Dad shakes his head, but I know he
loves his boyfriend.
“Thanks for coming.”
He looks offended. “Like I'd ever miss this.” He plants a kiss on my
head then shakes Miller's hand. “Always good to see you, son.”
Just like every time he says it, Miller lights up when my father calls him
son. It's sweet and a little sad, but I'm happy that even though Miller has a
crappy relationship with his own parents, he doesn't have that with mine.
“Likewise, Dan.”
With one last quick hug, my dad takes off, and Miller wraps his arm
back around me.
“He's right, you know—Ernesto isn't the only one falling for a
Thomas.”
“That so?”
“That's so. I still fall for you every day.”
“That's a really cheesy thing to say, Miller.”
“What can I say? I think your romance novels are rubbing off on me.”
Miller, the ever-supportive man that he is, insists on reading my books
for authenticity from a sports dude's perspective. I won't lie, his insight has
come in handy, not to mention it's kind of fun to have someone to map out
the sex scenes with.
“You love them.”
“I love you,” he says, dragging me closer into his arms, wrapping them
around my waist and sliding them dangerously low. I know for certain if we
weren't in a crowded room right now, he'd already have his hands on my
ass. “I can't wait to slide this forest green dress off you tonight.”
“I can't wait to let you slide it off.”
He dips his head, lips at my ear. “I can't wait to see you on your knees
staring up at me when we get inside.”
My heart pounds, and a shiver races down my spine at his words.
“Inside our apartment,” he adds, and another shudder runs through me
as he dips his hands just an inch lower.
I was already spending all of my time at Miller's place anyway, so we
made it official two weeks ago. It's been two weeks full of nonstop sex, and
I'm so not complaining.
“Are you allowed to leave your own party early?” he whispers, his lips
ghosting over the shell of my ear then down across my neck. “There are so
many things I want to do to you tonight, Scout.”
Another tremor. “I'm sure there are rules against it, but I kind of don't
care right now.”
“Kind of?”
“Definitely not. Do not care at all.”
“That so?”
More kisses, and my knees begin to shake.
“You have to stop,” I groan.
“I don't…”
Kiss.
“…think…”
Kiss.
“…I can.”
I shift my hands up his neck, running them through the ends of his hair,
tugging until he's looking at me with hazy, lust-filled golden eyes. “Then
take me home, Grady.”
A deep growl moves through his chest, and my wish gets granted.
I finally get my happily ever after.

GREER
“I'm telling you, asswipe, that's what I did. I tried to deke him, but he's too
good.”
“Well, then you didn't deke him right. If you make it convincing
enough, he'll bite. Ask the goalie—he'll tell you.”
Moe and Larry—no, scratch that. That would make me Curly, and the
Three Stooges we are not.
Tweedledee and Tweedledum—much better—going quiet has me
glancing up from my beer, the same one I've been nursing for the last hour.
The cloudy amber beverage is warm, and my stomach is turning at the
thought of trying to finish it.
Well, it's either that or the pit that started forming the minute I hung up
the phone with my mother.
My stomach turns yet again just thinking about the call.
Yep. That's it.
“Well, Mr. Hotshot Goalie? Any input?” Fitz, the forward for the
Carolina Comets, asks impatiently.
“Fitz is right, Hayes. You have to sell it harder. I've given up a few soft
goals on good dekes.”
Fitz throws his fist into the air and lets out a loud whoop. It's obnoxious
enough to draw eyes, something I really don't want to do tonight, so I tug
my hat down lower.
“Shut up,” I hiss with a scowl.
“What?” He shrugs, glancing around. “Nobody is paying us any
attention. Besides, it's Slapshots—they know better than to mess with us in
here.”
That's usually true. This place is a haven for those on the Comets, but
sometimes there are nights when people don't care that it's our off night and
want to hound us.
I don't typically drink during the season, but I couldn't say no when Fitz
and Hayes invited me out. We've just come off an eight-game winning
streak where I recorded not one but two shutouts.
It's February, and we're on a roll. I feel fucking unstoppable right now,
and I don't want to let that feeling go just yet, especially not right now
when we're walking into a six-game homestand. We kill it on home ice.
“Come on, man. Lighten up.” Hayes claps me on the shoulder. “We're
hot as hell right now, so have fun and stop scowling at everyone.”
I glance down at Hayes' hand, which is still resting on me, and that
scowl deepens. I look back at him with one brow raised in an Are you
seriously touching me right now? kind of way.
He lifts both hands in the air in surrender. “S-Sorry,” he mutters.
I nod once, letting it go. I'm not big on touchy-feely shit, but he's the
rookie, so I don't expect him to know that.
I can't seem to let go of the call I had with my mother just before we
stepped into the bar, the one that's put a damper on my whole evening.
She's getting married.
Again.
Or should I say again again again. It's her fourth marriage, and I don't
even know how many “serious relationships.”
I want to be happy for her. I really do, but it's difficult when I know this
one will end in the same heartbreak as all the others.
“What's up with you, Greer? You seem grumpier than normal, and you
just chased the rookie off.”
I glance up to see that his seat is, in fact, now empty.
Oops.
“Just tired,” I tell him.
Fitz's eyes narrow, and I'm annoyed by how hard he's staring at me. He
knows I'm lying.
“Does this extra scowly-ness have anything to do with that mysterious
phone call you took before we came in?”
I sigh, then toss back the rest of my beer because why not? I'm already
miserable as fuck. May as well go for broke at this point.
I cringe as the warm liquid slides down my throat. I know some people
love their warm beers, but I am not that type of person. I want it ice cold,
like so fucking cold you feel like you need to wear gloves to tip the bottle
back. The coldness matches my dead, black heart, and I relish it.
“I'll take that as a yes,” Fitz says.
I nod. “It was my mom.”
“Oh? I fucking love talking to my mom.” He glances around, then
points at me. “Don't tell anyone I said that or sounded so damn excited.” He
clears his throat and pushes his shoulders back.
I try to hide my smirk at how tough he's trying to look.
“I love talking to my mom too,” I tell him, and he relaxes at my words.
“She's getting married.”
“Married? That's awesome! Congratulations to her.”
I scoff, and Fitz doesn't miss it.
“Uh-oh. Do you not like the guy or something?”
“No clue. I haven't met him.”
David seems like a nice guy from the few times I've said hello on
FaceTime, but so did Archie, Harry, and Kenneth, and not one of those
relationships endured. Besides, I learned a long time ago not to get attached
to anyone my mother is dating because the likelihood of it lasting is slim.
“Does she seem happy about it?”
“She's fucking ecstatic.” And that's the truth. The problem is, she's
always happy about the wedding. It's the whole making-a-relationship-work
part she's not so keen on.
“Then what's the issue?”
“It's not her first wedding.” Far from it. “The last one…I wasn't on my
best behavior.”
“You slept with a bridesmaid, didn't you?”
I wince. “Three.”
“Huh?”
“I slept with three of them.”
Fitz's eyes widen. “At the same time?”
“No! Well, kind of. Two of them, yes. The third, no. I slept with her at
my mom's second wedding. She was not happy when she walked in on the
threesome and caused a scene.”
Fitz's mouth is hanging open at this point, and I can't say I blame him. I
was shocked, too, when the door to the coat closet flew open and I had two
sets of lips wrapped around my cock. I was just about to come when
Maggie—or was it Mary? I can't remember—started screeching and chased
away my orgasm.
“So, is this your mom's third wedding? Maybe the third time is the
charm for all of you?”
“Fourth,” I correct him.
“Fourth…” Fitz swallows once, twice. “Well, that's okay. Sometimes
things don't work out.”
My lips twitch at how diplomatic he's being right now, choosing his
words carefully so he doesn't offend my mother or me.
“Also, maybe don't sleep with bridesmaids and ruin your mom's big
day this time?”
“Therein lies my problem—she wants me to bring a date to the
wedding. Guess she thinks it'll prevent me from sleeping with anyone from
her salon, which I assume is who will be in her wedding party.”
“A date? Yikes.”
It's a well-known fact to everyone on the team that I don't do
relationships. Period. Ever.
It's why, as much as I like my teammates, I don't hang out with them
often anymore. Wright and Rhodes are both hitched, Lowell has a damn kid
—hard pass on that shit—and now even Miller found someone to love his
dumb ass. Having to see them all wrapped up in their lovey-dovey shit?
Yeah, no-fucking-thank-you.
It's why I'm hanging out with Fitz so much lately. He's single, therefore
he's not shoving all that happy, hearts-in-the-eyes bullshit down my throat. I
swear I can feel my esophagus swelling at the thought of having to watch
all the puppy-dog looks those guys seem to have. It's annoying. What the
fuck is so great about love anyway? All it does is beat you down and break
you and lead to misery. I'll pass on that.
“It's just a date, though, right? Not like you're the one getting married.”
I gag, and Fitz laughs, slapping me on the back.
“Don't be so dramatic. I'm sure it's not that bad.”
“You think marriage isn't that bad?” Is he drunk? Am I drunk?
Fitz shrugs. “Yeah. I mean, hell, look at the other guys. They seem
happy enough.”
“So did my mom during her first marriage. Oh, and her second and
third. My dad has fathered children with multiple women he's had longterm relationships with. He just called me last week to inform me that he
and his latest baby momma are ‘taking some time apart.' Is that the kind of
happiness you want?”
Fitz grimaces. “Maybe not.”
“That's what I thought.” I raise my glass to my lips, but I'm
disappointed to see that it's empty. Fitz talking about marriage left such a
gross taste in my mouth that I somehow forgot all about my awful warm
beer.
I slide the empty glass across the counter. From the other end of the bar,
the bartender tips his head in a silent question: Another?
I signal that I'm done, figuring I'd better quit while I'm ahead. This
night is clearly a wash.
“Okay, so you're not rushing down the aisle. I get it, but one date won't
kill you, especially if it's for your mom. Do you know the number of
horrible dates I've been on for my mother? You'll be fine for one night.”
“Then you're a better son than me. I'm not bringing a date.”
“Scared you won't be able to find one?”
I narrow my eyes, not liking the cocky smile that's taken over his face.
He's trying to bait me, and fuck me, it's working.
I hate that it's working.
“I can find a date just fine.”
“Damn straight you can,” Hayes says, slipping back onto his empty
stool. “You were the NHL's first star of the week last week—you could
have your pick of women. Hell, I bet there are at least ten ladies here
tonight just waiting for you to ask them to go home with you.” He inclines
his head toward the other side of the bar. “Including those babes over
there.”
“Don't call them babes. You sound like Miller,” Fitz says to him before
I can.
“Babes, women—whatever. When I was getting my drink, I heard them
talking about us. They're definitely interested. Could make for a fun night.”
Hayes bounces his brows up and down.
I slide my eyes toward the group he's referring to. A few hours of
rolling around in the sheets doesn't sound too bad. It may be just what I
need to turn this now-soured evening around.
There are four women sitting at a round table. One is a blonde looking
this way, her lashes fluttering as she takes a sip of her drink, which looks
like it's more sugar than alcohol.
When I make eye contact with her, another throws her head back. She
slaps the shoulder of the other woman next to her, who is also laughing. It
comes off as forced and fake, especially with the way they both keep
looking over here as if they're waiting for us to pay attention to them.
Finally, there's the woman with dark hair who is partially hidden from
view and isn't looking over her shoulder to get a glimpse. In fact, she has an
elbow resting on the table, and she's twirling her straw in her drink. She
seems bored, like she wants to be somewhere else right now.
I want to go over and ask her where that place is.
“Should I go talk to them? I should go talk to them, right?” Hayes asks,
already pushing himself off the stool.
I'm quick to reach out and grab the back of his shirt, dragging him back
down.
“Leave them alone, Hayes.” I shove his shoulder down hard, letting him
know I'm not kidding.
“Why do you ruin all the fun?”
“Because two of the women have wedding rings on their fingers. If you
want to make headlines, do it on the ice, not off it.”
“Oh shit.” Hayes gulps. “I missed that.”
“I didn't.”
“Yeah, that's because you're allergic to commitment, so you pay extra
attention to that shit,” Fitz comments.
I don't argue because he's right.
“We should get going anyway.” The forward rises from his stool.
“Coach Heller said the practice isn't mandatory, but he did that eyebrow
thing he does that means he'd like to see us there anyway.”
Hayes groans. “But…but…babes!”
“Don't call them babes, Miller Jr.” Fitz shakes his head, tugging the
young player up by his arm. “Coming, Greer?”
“Yeah. I'm going to take a leak. Meet you out front.”
“Sounds good.” He steers Hayes away from the poor, unsuspecting
women and toward the door.
I chuckle to myself when I see his bottom lip come out. Fuckin'rookies,
man.
As I cross the bar toward the restroom, I can't help but let my eyes
wander to the table of women Hayes pointed out. They are hot; I'll give him
that, and burying myself between a set of legs does sound better than
drowning in alcohol.
But…I should go. It's the responsible thing to do. We're on a heater
right now, and I don't want to risk that by staying out too late or drinking
too much or for some random pussy.
This season is all about no distractions.
We have a Cup on the line, and I intend to make it mine.

STEVIE
The minute the strip turned pink, telling me I was pregnant at nineteen
during my freshman year of college, I settled into the fact that the fun,
partying part of my life was over. Going to clubs, going to bars, and dating
around weren't in the cards for me anymore. I had a kid to raise, and Macie
was going to come first no matter what.
I guess what I didn't plan on was that kid growing up so damn fast or
her wanting to spend time with her aunt and not her mother. Since when did
she become so independent at ten?
So, when Bianca Macbeth, a mom from my daughter's school, called to
invite me out for a girls' night, I didn't have any reason to say no. In fact, it
sounded like fun. A night out with fellow moms having a few drinks? Hell
yes! It was just what I needed.
Now that I'm here, though, sitting at a bar surrounded by women I
should want to hang out with, I'm miserable and would much rather be
sitting at home on my couch with my kid and a Disney movie pulled up.
Well, it would probably be a hockey game instead of a movie since she's
obsessed with the sport.
I hate saying this, but…I'm bored.
I'm not interested in the same drink I've been sipping for the last thirty
minutes or the music that's thumping through the speakers. Hell, the only
thing that really has my interest right now is the TV sitting above Bianca's
head that's playing a recap of the Carolina Comets game from last night. I
blame Macie for that one, seeing as I was never interested in hockey until
she became obsessed. Now, though, I can't seem to escape it. Even my
younger sister, Scout, is involved in hockey since she's dating a player on
our local team. My life is now more entwined with the sport than I ever
thought possible.
It's probably why I have zero interest in the conversation between
Bianca and the other moms right now. They've been going on for ten
minutes about the three Comets players sitting on the other side of the bar,
but I'm just not as starstruck as they are.
I won't even get into the fact that they shouldn't be batting their lashes
and pushing their tits up like they are, considering two of them are married
and one is in a long-term relationship. That's their business, not mine.
Besides, I don't want to rock the boat with the only moms nice enough
to invite me out. It would be an understatement to say it's been a struggle to
make mom friends. The groups are already formed, and the rumors about
my failed marriage have already been spread. It's hard to fix the image
everyone seems to have of me.
“Seriously, he's so hot. I want to lick his jawline so badly. I—oh god!
He's looking over here!” Bianca hisses, running her fingers through the
ends of her hair.
“Never in my life would I think a guy missing a front tooth would be so
cute, but oh my god, Fitzgerald makes me swoon.”
I can't help but grin at that comment from Denise, another mom,
because Fitzgerald is cute, especially when he has his tooth out. He also
happens to be the sweetest guy ever. Quiet and polite, I love it when he
stops by my sister's donut truck.
But I don't tell them that. I have no interest in advertising that I'm
familiar with the players they're fawning over. There's no attention on me
right now, and I'd like to keep it that way.
The girls keep giggling and staring at the hockey players. One must get
up because Bianca's eyes track him across the bar, and I swear she licks her
lips. I want to laugh, but I don't.
If only they saw the side of the players I see. They're just like everyone
else and not worth getting all flustered over. Some are sweet—like Smith,
Miller, and Fitzgerald—and some are downright assholes, like Greer, the
grumpy goalie who is never, ever nice, not even to Macie.
“So, Stevie, I heard a rumor…” I inwardly groan as Bianca turns her
ultra-white smile on me. “Is your sister really dating a Comets player?”
Crap. So much for keeping that part of my life quiet.
“She is. Grady Miller.”
“Miller?!” Denise fans her face. “God, that man is so hot. He makes me
tingle in all the right places.”
Hearing her talk about my sister's boyfriend like that makes me
uncomfortable. I don't know how Scout handles this stuff every day, and I
know she deals with it because I see her social media accounts. So many
people accusing her of only having a publishing deal because of her
“famous hockey boyfriend” is bullshit. If only they could have seen what I
did over the years. She's been through some rough stuff. I know how hard
she worked for what she has, so the comments annoy me, just like Denise's
do.
“How'd she meet him again?”
“Well, she owns Scout's Sweets. It's—”
“That's the cute little donut truck, right?” Bianca interrupts.
I force a smile. “Yes, that's the one. Several of the players on the team
stop by often.”
Sometimes too often if you ask me. Especially Greer. I could go the rest
of my life without ever seeing him again, and it would still be too soon.
Is he possibly the most gorgeous man I've ever laid eyes on? Yes.
Does it erase what a giant dick he is? Not even a little.
“What about Fitzgerald?”
“Hmm?” I ask.
“Does Fitzgerald ever stop by? Because if so, I might need to make a
trip there.”
“Kerry! Don't ask that. It's none of our business,” Bianca scolds, but
her eyes drift my way anyway like she's waiting for me to say it's okay and
spill all the secrets of the players.
I'm not going to do that.
“Actually, I—”
“Hello, ladies,” a deep voice says, quieting me and the rest of the group.
I turn to find a stranger standing at the end of the table, a tumbler of
something brown in his hand. He's tall with deep blond hair and ruddy
cheeks. The scent of alcohol wafts off him, and I'm certain it's not coming
from his glass. It's him.
I glance at the other women, and none seem bothered by him
interrupting our evening. In fact, Denise sits up higher, and Bianca grins his
way like she can't wait to sink her claws into him. Kerry seems interested
as well.
“Hi,” Bianca says breathily.
“You ladies want some company?”
Before any of us can even respond—because I damn sure would say no
—he sits down.
Right next to me.
I slide away from him as subtly as I can.
He grins over at me, and I muster up the tiniest of smiles back. There's
something about him I don't like, something that puts me on edge that I
can't quite place my finger on. The other girls don't seem to mind him,
smiling and flirting. Maybe it's all in my head.
A hand appears in my field of vision, and I jump in surprise.
“Hey, easy there, sugar. Just wanted to say hi.”
I glance up to find the guy smirking at me. I assume it's supposed to be
cute, flirty, or something of that nature. It's not. It's making me extremely
uncomfortable.
I scoot away from him farther. He doesn't miss it.
In fact, he laughs and leans into me. “Playing hard to get, huh? That's
all right. I like a good chase.” He winks, and I want to vomit. “I'm Kyle.”
It hits me.
Michael.
He reminds me of my ex-husband. His perfectly coiffed hair, his stupid
collared shirt, those hideous khakis—even the red that's staining his cheeks
is reminiscent of my ex, who loved a bottle of whiskey more than he ever
loved Macie or me.
Michael was a drunk and an asshole. This guy is giving me those exact
vibes, and I really, really want to be anywhere else. My hands are clammy,
and the pace of my heartbeat quickens.
I wish I were at home. I wish I were at home. I wish I were at home.
Shit. I didn't tap my heels together.
“I'm going to use the restroom. Excuse me.”
I shove out of my chair and away from the table faster than I ever have
in my life. I barrel through the bar and down the hall. I never thought I'd
see a bar bathroom as a sanctuary, but the air that whooshes back into my
lungs the moment I swing the door open makes it feel like one.
Pressing my back against it once it's closed, I suck in breath after
breath.
I'm not sure how long passes until my breathing finally evens out some,
but when my racing heart finally settles down, the shame washes over me. I
haven't felt like this since the night I finally walked away from my ex. I
hated it then, and I hate it even more now. I hate that he has a lasting effect
on me.
I don't want him to. I'm stronger than this—stronger than him.
Pushing off the door, I give myself a shake as I head for the stall. I
didn't really have to pee, but now that I'm here, I might as well.
I take my time, folding the toilet paper with precision instead of
wadding it up. I wash my hands three times, doing everything I can to
extend my time in here so I don't have to spend another second at the table
with the intrusive stranger who reminds me so much of my ex it makes my
skin crawl. When I've exhausted all options, I take a steadying breath and
pull the door open.
I'm two steps into the hallway when I regret my decision.
A dark shadow falls over me, and I don't even need to look up to know
who it is. I can smell him.
“There you are, sugar. Thought you ran out on me.”
In an instant, he's in my space, crowding me against the wall and trying
to get his hands on my waist.
“Don't touch me.”
I hate how breathless I sound, hate the fear that's racing up my spine.
The same fear has me frozen in place instead of running.
“Oh, come on. You don't mean that.” I'm sure he thinks he's being
charming, but he's not. “I'd love to take you home tonight.”
“No.”
He laughs, reaching for me again, and I do everything I can to block his
touch. How is nobody seeing this? Why is nobody helping?
“Stop, please.”
Another laugh that has my stomach revolting.
“I said no.”
I squeeze my eyes shut when he leans in, turning my head so if he does
kiss me, at least it won't be on my mouth. I want to puke. I want to scream.
I want to run.
But none of those things happen. Instead, a rush of cold air hits me, and
the breath returns to my lungs in a whoosh. There's some grunting and
someone talking, a few cuss words thrown around.
I swear I don't care who my savior is; I'm going to give them a big ol'
kiss.
When I finally peel my eyes open, I hate myself for making that
promise, because I know exactly who I'm staring at, and kissing him is the
last thing I want to do.
Greer.

GREER
“Don't touch me.”
The voice carries through the door of the restroom. They must be
speaking pretty loudly because Slapshots isn't a quiet place.
“No.”
What the hell…
“Stop, please.”
I tug the door open. There's a man standing in the darkened hallway,
and it looks like he has someone crowded up against the wall.
“I said no.”
It's a small voice—a scared voice, and there isn't a single atom in my
body that hesitates to jump into action. I grab the asshole by the back of his
shirt, yanking him away from the woman who clearly doesn't want him in
her space and shoving him against the wall, my forearm on his throat.
“Hey! What the fuck?!”
I shove into him just a little harder. “She said no, you dick.”
“Mind your own business.” The asshole tries to push me off him, but
it's no use. I'm bigger and stronger, and it looks like I've had about eight
drinks less than him.
“Douchebags taking advantage of women is my business.”
“F-Fuck off.” He tries to fight me again, and I strengthen my hold until
he chokes out a cough.
I get a sick satisfaction from it, but I don't give a shit. I'm glad he can't
breathe. I'm sure the woman he was bothering felt the same way with him
all up in her face.
“F-F-Fuck y-you.” He barely gets the words out.
“You're hurting him,” a soft voice says beside me.
“Good.”
Watching the red deepen on his cheeks and the fear grow in his eyes
makes me happy. Fuck this guy. Fuck him for hitting on a woman who
clearly isn't interested, and fuck him for trying to touch her when he wasn't
invited to. He deserves to feel the same fear she did.
I barely register someone touching me. It's a soft touch, light and
feathery.
“Greer.”
The single word pulls me from my stupor, and I glance at the woman I
just rescued from this asshole. She's standing next to me now, and it takes
me all of two seconds to realize who she is.
“Greer,” she says again softly. “Let him go.”
The soft plea in her voice has me releasing my hold on the asshole. He
shoves at me again, but I don't budge.
“When a woman says no, she means no. You got it?” He doesn't answer,
and I shake him. “Do you fucking got it, prick?”
He sputters out another cough, his air supply dwindling slowly. “I—I
got it.”
“Good. Now, you're going to walk out of this bar and not even look at
another woman. Clear?”
He nods several times, his face contorting with pain from the pressure
against his throat. I give him one last shove, just for good measure, then let
him go. His knees buckle, and he nearly falls to the floor before catching
himself on the wall, then stumbling down the hall and back into the light of
the bar.
I stare after him, making sure he leaves as instructed. With the number
of people and chairs he bumps into, I wonder if he even has his eyes open.
My fists, which have been clenched at my sides since I let him go, relax
slightly.
“You could have seriously hurt him.”
I whirl around to the woman standing in the hallway. Her arms are
crossed, and her lips are twisted into a disappointed frown.
“That was kind of the plan, something I planned to enjoy, yet you
stopped me.”
“Because you could have seriously hurt him.”
“Your point?”
“Your career. Or did you forget about the eight-game heater you're
currently on?”
A grin pulls at my lips, and I cross my arms to match her stance.
“You've been watching me, huh?”
She rolls her eyes, the ones I know are deep blue. “Not even kind of.”
“Then how do you know we're on a heater?”
“Um, because I live here, and people talk? For some reason, you have
fans.”
“I have fans because I'm a damn good goalie.”
“You're cocky.”
“I'm good.”
She looks like she wants to argue that one, but she doesn't. Instead, she
drops her arms and turns on her heel, marching back through the bar.
I follow.
She leads me—and I say that in the loosest of terms—to the exact table
Hayes was pointing at earlier. So this is the mystery dark-haired woman.
“Stevie!” the blonde says when we stop. “We were just about to come
look for you.”
She's lying, and it's painful how obvious it is. I bet they didn't even
realize Stevie was missing, which means they had no clue she was about
two seconds away from being assaulted.
The woman's eyes land on me, and they widen. “Oh. I didn't realize you
were…busy.” She grins, then bats her lashes. “Hi, I'm Bianca. It's nice to
meet you.”
I don't respond because it's not nice to meet her. Maybe if she gave a
shit about her friend and didn't blatantly lie to her, I'd play nice, but not
right now. Not after Stevie just went through what she did.
Stevie doesn't miss my lack of manners, glaring at me before turning a
sweet smile her friends' way. “I'm sorry. I got…held up.” Her smile falters,
and if her friends notice, they don't indicate it. “It was my daughter, so I
need to get going.”
“Aw, so soon?” Bianca pushes her lip out. “Bummer.”
“Such a bummer,” another woman echoes, though she's not looking at
Stevie. Her eyes are on me as she twirls a strand of hair around her
fingers…one of which bears a wedding ring.
See? Marriage doesn't mean shit.
“I'll walk you out,” I say to Stevie.
Her eyes narrow, telling me she wants to argue with me yet again, but
the way her eyes flit toward her friends says she doesn't want to cause a
scene.
“Thank you.”
The words come out forced, and I can't help but smile.
Stevie slides her coat over her arms, pulling her hair from under the
jacket. An aroma of something fruity hits my nose. I can't quite place my
finger on the scent, but whatever it is, I don't hate it.
“Thanks again for inviting me out,” Stevie says to the blonde.
“Of course. You'll have to come out with us again sometime.” Her eyes
slide to mine, then back to Stevie. “Soon.”
Lady translation: I want all the details.
Too bad for them there won't be any juicy details. Stevie hates me, and
I'm not interested anyway.
“Oh, you dirty, dirty dog, you.” Hayes rests his hand on my shoulder,
whispering so only I can hear. “And you said we should stay away.” He
grins. “Ladies, lovely to meet you.”
I glance over at Fitz, who shrugs. “We were wondering where you were.
He barreled over here, so I figured I'd follow.”
“Remind me to tell Lowell you're a horrible babysitter.”
“Pfft. My nieces love me.”
“Yeah, that's clearly because you don't watch them and let them do
whatever they want.”
“So, ladies, how's your evening going?” Hayes asks, laying the charm
on thickly.
“It's much better now,” the blonde answers, tossing her hair behind her
shoulder. “I'm Bianca,” she tells him in that same sultry voice she tried to
use on me. This time, it works. Hayes takes the bait like he hasn't eaten in
days.
Jesus. They're so obvious it's painful.
I turn my attention back to Stevie, but she's not there. I look left, I look
right.
She's gone.
“The brunette?” Fitz asks.
“Did you see her?”
He hitches his thumb toward the door. “She left.”
“Fuck,” I mutter. “I gotta—”
“Go,” Fitz finishes for me. “I'll take care of Hayes.”
I want to tell him given the fact that he let him just waltz back in here, I
doubt that, but I don't. I head for the door, bursting through it in about two
seconds. I scan the street to my left, then look right and spot her just a few
feet up the sidewalk.
She stands just outside the light of the streetlamp, her own phone
illuminating her face as she scrolls through whatever's on the screen. Her
long dark lashes cast a shadow against her cheek. Her jacket may be puffy
and bulky and not do any favors for her figure, but her jeans sure as hell do,
fitting her like a second skin.
Her dark hair is covering part of her face, but even from here, I can see
the lone tear running down her cheek, can hear her sniffle.
I take a step toward her, and her head whips my way at the sound of my
shoes against the concrete. She immediately takes a step back into the light,
but I notice the way she relaxes when she sees it's just me.
“What do you want.”
It doesn't really come out as a question. It's more like she's annoyed
that I've followed her.
“I…” But nothing comes out.
What do I want? Why did I follow her out here?
She lifts her brows in impatience. “Well?”
“I wanted to see that you were okay.”
Her head jerks back in surprise, and I can attest that the feeling is
mutual.
My statement is honest, though. I do want to see that she's okay.
“Oh.” The word is quiet, but I hear it all the same. “I'm fine.”
Her chin wobbles, and another tear slips down her cheek.
I take another step toward her. “Are you sure?”
“I'm fine.” She swipes at her face, rolls her shoulders back, and gives
herself a shake, tips her chin up. “I'm fine.”
This time, the words come out stronger. It's almost like she believes the
harder or more she says them, the truer they'll become.
“Okay.”
“Okay,” she echoes. Another sniffle.
“Do you need a ride home?”
“I got an Uber. It'll be here in ten minutes.”
“I'll stay with you, then.”
“You really don't need to.”
“I'm waiting for my Uber too.”
That's a lie. I haven't called for a car, though I do need to. I'm not drunk
and didn't have much, but I don't want to risk anything.
“So, did you know that guy?”
She shakes her head. “No.”
“Good.” And it is good. I don't like the idea of her associating with
someone like that.
“He was drunk.”
Now it's me who is surprised. “Your point?”
“I'm just saying…he was drunk.”
“That's not an excuse to assault someone.”
“I know that.”
“Do you? Because it doesn't sound like it.”
She glowers at me. “I do know that. I'm just saying maybe he wouldn't
have been so…forward if he wasn't drunk.”
I snort. “Right. I fucking doubt that. Guy gave me the heebies.”
I shake my head, annoyed she's defending him but also not trying to
blame her. She's probably in shock, probably trying to rationalize what just
happened. I don't need to pile on her right now.
“I don't watch you, you know.”
“Hmm?”
“Before, you said I must be watching you. I'm just telling you I don't.”
“You already said that.”
“And I'm reiterating it. I don't watch you. My daughter does.”
“Scrawny little shit with braces, right?”
Another glare. “Her name is Macie. She's obsessed with the Comets.”
“She has good taste, then.”
“She doesn't like you.”
Now it's my turn to glare. “That so?”
“She calls you The Jackass.”
I tuck my lips together so she can't see my smile because, honestly, it's
a good name for me. I am a jackass sometimes. Everyone says so.
“She seems…”
“Careful, Greer. She's ten, and I will scratch your eyes out.”
I rock back on my heels, impressed by her tenacity. “I was going to say
she seems like she's got some fire in her.”
Stevie lets out a light laugh, a smile curving her lips. “You could say
that.”
“Who is her favorite player?”
“I think this week it's Miller.”
“Miller? Seriously?”
She lifts a shoulder. “He makes her aunt happy.”
I roll my eyes because of course it has to do with love and all that sappy
relationship shit. “Miller is an idiot.”
“He truly is sometimes. He asked me yesterday if goose and geese were
two different animals.”
“He did not.”
“Oh, he did. I've never had secondhand embarrassment so hard in my
life.” She shakes her head with a smile. “But he's sweet too, and he loves
my sister so damn much.”
An involuntary groan leaves me, and Stevie doesn't miss it.
“What was that for?”
“Love.”
“Excuse me?”
“Love.” I lift my hat, running a hand through my hair before putting the
cap back on backward. “It's a crock of shit. The idea of waiting around to
find the right person is sickening.”
“Ah.” She nods. “That makes sense now.”
“What makes sense?”
“Well…” She waves her hand in my direction. “You.”
“Meaning?”
“Meaning everything. The scowl that never leaves your face and the
way you treat people, like you're uninterested and holding them at arm's
length—the lack of love in your life explains that well.”
“I have love in my life.”
“Who? Because last I checked, you're single and have never been
married.”
“You know, that sounds an awful lot like you've looked me up.”
Stevie huffs. “I have not.”
It's a lie. We both know it.
I just want to know why: why she looked me up, and why she's lying.
Scratch that—I probably know why she's lying. She knows I'll never let
her forget it.
“I have love in my life,” I insist again, though I don't know why. Stevie
is nobody to me. I don't need to convince her I'm not missing something by
not being in a relationship.
I already have to convince my mother of that; I don't need to add
someone else to the list. She's enough to deal with, thank you.
“I'm sure you do.” Her words are the exact opposite of the look on her
face. She doesn't believe me at all.
That's fine because I don't believe me either.
Do I have love in my life? If you count the fact that my parents both
love me, sure. Other than that…well, no, not really. I like my teammates
and would consider them friends, but do I love them? I don't think so.
So, fine, maybe I don't have real love in my life. But I'm fine.
I am fine…right?
A car pulls up to the curb, and Stevie steps toward it.
“Wait!” I call out, startling us both.
“What?” she asks, staring up at me with her brows drawn tight together.
“You don't even know if that's your Uber.”
She lifts her eyes skyward. “It's mine.”
“But I ordered one too.” That's a lie. “It could be mine.”
“It's not. It's mine.”
“Says?”
“Um, the app?” The sarcasm drips from her words as she holds her
phone my way, and I take a quick look at the information, then check the
car in front of us.
It's her ride.
With a groan, she shakes her head. “I don't even know why I'm
showing you this. I'm leaving now.”
“Can you wait a second?”
A loud sigh falls from her lips. “What.”
She's clearly annoyed by me. I would be too. Honestly, I don't even
know why I want her to wait; I just do.
“Are you sure you're okay?”
She stares up at me for a moment with her head tipped to the side like
she's studying me. I don't like being under scrutiny.
“That's the second time you've asked me that. Why do you care so
much?”
“Because I'm not a heartless monster.”
She snorts out a laugh. “Sure you're not.” Her hand lands on the rear
door handle. “Can I go now?”
“Yeah, go.” I wave my hand toward the car. “You're welcome, by the
way.”
A pause.
A slow turn my way.
A heated stare.
“Excuse me?”
“I said, you're welcome. For rescuing you.”
Stevie scoffs, then pulls the door open before leveling me with one last
glare I'm sure I'll bear the burn marks from tomorrow. “Good night,
jackass.”
Before I can register what she's just said, she climbs into the back of the
car, which promptly pulls away from the curb, and she disappears down the
road. I stand there like an idiot, staring after her for far too many minutes,
trying to figure out why I don't exactly feel great right now.
“Wow.”
I spin on my heel to find Fitzgerald shaking his head at me.
“What?”
“She's right—you really are a jackass.”
This time…I think I may agree.

STEVIE
“Wait, wait, wait. He said what?”
“You're welcome for rescuing you.” I shake my head. “Who the hell
does he think he is?”
I toss the dough I've been working for the last forty minutes onto the
counter, annoyed it's not doing what I want it to. I'm sure most of that is my
fault. I'm distracted. I can't stop thinking about last night or Greer's parting
words. They've been grating on me since I got into the Uber, and my poor
driver had to listen to me complain the entire ride. I'm sure I'll be seeing
the karmic response to that at some point and get stuck with a driver who
doesn't stop talking.
But I was pissed.
I am pissed. Greer's comment was just so…him.
“A jackass,” says Rosie, the head baker at my sister's donut truck,
Scout's Sweets. “A complete and total moron, too. Why the hell would he
say that?”
“Because he's the worst. I hate him.”
“I hate him too.”
“You do?”
“Of course I do. Solidarity!” Rosie says, lifting a fist in the air. “I'm
here for you.”
I chuckle. “Thank you. I appreciate that.” I peek over at my sister, who
is standing at the back of the truck, a donut in hand. “Any solidarity from
you?”
She takes another bite of her donut—a Strawyummy Cake, my favorite
—then chews and swallows. “Sort of.”
I take a step back because I am genuinely surprised by Scout's
comment. “Sort of?”
“Greer is definitely a jackass…but he did step in when you needed help.
I can't fault him for that. You're my sister, and I'll love anyone who keeps
you safe.”
She's right. I know she is.
And while I'm super grateful for Greer pulling that douchebag off me,
and I know I owe him for it, it doesn't change the fact that he was just so…
Greer about the whole thing. Cockiness radiated off him, and I wanted to
wipe the smug smile right off his face with my palm.
I'm sure somewhere deep down, Greer is a nice guy—he did help me,
after all—but sometimes, no matter how many good deeds someone does, it
doesn't erase their douchebaggery.
“I still don't like him,” I mutter.
“I'm surprised. You're normally Miss Sunshine who loves and gives
everyone a chance. Why not Greer?”
“Have you met him?” I counter.
She has a point, though. Even with my checkered past with my ex, I still
love and trust people. I'm friendly. I like to talk. But there's just something
about Greer… He does something to me that I can't describe, probably
because it's nothing I've ever experienced before.
“He's hot,” Rosie comments, working her hands through the dough in
front of her like she didn't just drop a bomb.
“What?!”
Rosie shrugs at my outburst. “He is. That jawline of his is…wow. It's
too bad it's always covered by his goalie mask.”
Her words remind me of Bianca last night and how badly she wanted to
lick Greer's jaw. That's two women obsessing over him. Is it even that
good? I've never noticed before.
“Oh please. Yes you have.”
Crap. Did I say that out loud?
“There's no way you could have missed it.” Scout backs Rosie up.
“Pretty sure it's sharper than his skates.”
“Don't you already have a hot hockey player to drool over?”
A dreamy look crosses her face, and Scout sighs. “I do. My hot hockey
player agrees with me, though.”
“That Greer is hot?”
“Yep.” She nods. “I had him rank all his teammates one night when we
were bored.”
“And?” Rosie asks, setting her dough aside, fully invested in the
conversation now.
“Greer was at the top. Then Rhodes because his scar makes him hotter.
Fitz because of his missing tooth, Lowell because he's a daddy—though
now that I'm thinking about it, I'm not sure if he meant daddy or Daddy.
Wright was at the bottom of the top five.” She shakes her head. “Wait, that's
not right. If I went with his real top five, he himself would come after Fitz.
We argued for thirty minutes about whether or not he could be on his list. I
won.”
She grins, clearly proud of herself.
“He put Greer before Fitz?” Rosie looks stunned. “Is he nuts?”
“I don't think so. I'm also very honored. I'll have to thank him for that.”
A chill runs up my spine.
I know that voice.
I turn on my heel with reluctance. I don't want to see him. Not right
now, or ever again.
“Oh god. He's going to kill me for telling you that.” Scout gulps
audibly.
“Please, Miller worships the ground you walk on,” Rosie tells her. “He's
so completely obsessed it almost makes me want to gag, and that's saying
something because I adore a good romance.”
Scout sighs, then says something to Rosie, but I don't catch it. I'm too
engrossed in the staring contest I've been roped into with Greer. He's
looking at me with green eyes that remind me of a summer day. He's not
smiling, nor is he frowning. He's…watching.
I hate it.
Almost like he can read my thoughts, a small smile pulls at the corners
of his lips, lifting them into a smug grin.
I hate that even more.
“Stevie.” His voice is deep, a low timbre that has no business sounding
as good as it does.
“Greer.”
His stupid lips pull up higher, somehow making his already smug smirk
even smugger.
“What are you doing here?”
“I'm getting a donut.”
I lift an eyebrow. “Since when?”
“Since I always do. It's Saturday.”
“Your point?”
“I come here every Saturday I can.”
Now both of my brows go up. Does he?
“You're usually not here.”
That's true, but how does he know that?
Saturday mornings are typically reserved for Macie, but since she
stayed with Scout and Miller last night, I figured I'd help Rosie for a few
hours. Scout's donut truck business has picked up since word of her dating
Miller got out. Customers are flocking here faster than ever before in hopes
of getting a glimpse of one of the Comets players. I'm sure if Greer had
arrived just an hour earlier when the line was to the parking lot, he would
have been hounded incessantly for autographs like Miller was. He took
Macie, and they're hiding at McDonald's across the street.
“I'm helping out.”
I don't tell him I'll probably be here more often from now on. The law
firm I work at is merging with another firm, and they don't need two
receptionists. I'm aware it's likely my head on the chopping block.
“So, are you going to help me out, then?”
“Excuse me?”
He points to the rack of donuts behind me. “Donuts. I want to order.”
“We're closed.”
He barks out a laugh just as Scout lets out a squeal.
“Stevie!” she admonishes.
“What? I'm on the clock today, not you. We're closed.”
“Stevie!” my sister says again, shoving me out of the way and pasting
on her best customer service smile. “Ignore her, Greer. What can I get for
you?”
“I got it,” Rosie says, already boxing something up.
“How do you know his order?”
She shrugs, setting the box on the counter, then moves toward the iced
coffee. “He comes here a lot.”
“He does not!”
“I do too,” says the man in question.
“Well, you can't. Not anymore.”
He lifts a perfectly arched brow, and I momentarily wonder if he gets
them waxed and shaped to look like that.
“I don't.”
“What?”
“My brows. I don't get them waxed or shaped, whatever the hell that
means.”
Shit. I have to stop saying what I'm thinking out loud, especially with
Greer here. The last thing I need is to think something positive about him
and accidentally say it. I don't want him to get any ideas about me liking
him.
I shudder at the thought. Liking Greer? Please. That will never happen.
“Here you go.” Rosie slides an iced coffee his way. The cup's contents
are pale, like it's loaded down with milk and sweetener.
He sticks a straw in the drink and takes a healthy swig almost instantly.
He exhales loudly, smacking his lips together in the most annoying manner.
“It's perfect, Rosie. Thank you.”
The way he says it…it's so…nice. So unlike Greer.
“It's on the house, too,” Scout tells him, hitching her thumb my way.
“Because of her.”
Another smirk. “Well, thank you, Stevie. Wasn't so hard to say, was it?”
I narrow my eyes. “You can leave now.”
My sister yells my name for the third time. “Stevie! You can't work here
if you're going to be mean to customers.”
“I'm not. Just to Greer.”
Scout drops her head into her hands. “Good lord.”
“It's okay, Scout,” he says magnanimously. “I don't mind. I can take it.”
“Well, I mind. You were so nice to her last night, helping her out. She
should maybe be a bit nicer,” Scout says through clenched teeth, eyes
narrowed at me in warning.
“Talking about me, huh?”
God, I want to jump over this counter and wipe the arrogant look off his
face.
“Go away, Greer.”
“Not until you say it.”
“Say what?”
“Thank you, Greer.”
I snort. “Not a chance.”
“Come on. Don't be that way. I thought we had a connection last night.”
“The only connecting we'll ever do is my palm with your face.”
“That's okay. I like it rough.” He bounces his brows up and down, and I
hate it so much.
The only thing I hate more is the pull I feel between my legs at the
thought of anything rough and sexual with him.
“Is that something you like too?” he asks, leaning closer. I want to get
away, want to do anything to put space between us, especially when his
green eyes are boring into me the way they are—like he's entirely too
invested in my answer—but I can't. That would give him the idea that he's
affecting me, and I'd rather him not know that.
So, I don't move. I don't answer him. The only thing I do is swallow the
lump that's suddenly formed in my throat.
“Interesting,” he murmurs, not missing it.
“Leave.”
He lets out a low, sinister laugh. “Say it.”
“Not going to happen, Greer.”
“Why not? Scared you'll have to acknowledge I helped you and you
owe me?”
I curl my lips in disgust at the word. “I don't owe you anything.”
“Sure you do, and I intend to collect on it.”
“For the tenth time this morning, leave.”
“I'll go, but only because I have somewhere to be.” He lifts his drink
Rosie's way. “Thank you,” he says, giving me a pointed look. “I'll see you
ladies later. Steve.”
“Jackass.”
He chuckles, then spins on his heel and treks back through the parking
lot with entirely too much swagger in his walk. It's obnoxious how
confident it is. It's almost as annoying as how well his long-sleeved shirt
clings to his back, showing off the build he hides under his pads.
But I don't care about that because I don't care about Greer. I dip my
hands back into the dough, kneading away, trying to channel all my
frustration into shaping donuts. I beat the pile of dough over and over,
shaping, then reshaping the same donut. I'm so annoyed I can't even make
a damn Long John.
“Ugh,” I groan, tossing the dough aside. “He is so…so…”
“Insanely hot?”
“Rosie!” I glare at her. “I thought you were on my team. What happened
to solidarity?”
“Oh, right.” She straightens her back. “Ugh. He's so gross. The worst.”
It's the worst acting job I've ever witnessed. Not a single word that
tumbles from her lips is believable.
“I can practically hear all the dirty thoughts running through your head
right now.”
“Nah.” She waves her hand. “The only one I'm fantasizing about is
Fitz.” She lets out a dreamy sigh, and it's kind of funny how head over
heels she is for him and how oblivious he is to it.
Scout points to her head baker. “I'm with her. Well, not the whole
fantasizing-about-Fitz thing, but the Greer-being-hot part. Because he is.”
“He's…fine looking.”
My little sister gives me a look that says I'm full of shit.
I ignore it.
Is Greer good-looking? Yeah, of course he is, but do I care? Not even a
little bit. He's an ass on a good day. He's grumpy, and he thinks he's better
than everyone else. I don't think that's hot at all.
“Mom!”
Now that I do care about.
I turn toward the parking lot just in time to see an excited Macie
running my way.
“Mom!” she calls again once she's closer. “You won't believe what
happened!”
“What's up?” I lean against the counter, watching as she skids to a stop
before the truck, just barely tall enough to reach the counter.
“Uncle Grady”—my heart melts a little when she says that—“paid for
everyone's lunch, then we took some food to Eddie. After that, he took me
to the store and let me pick out thirteen things. Anything I wanted.”
My brows go up at the last thing. “Thirteen?”
I slide my eyes Miller's way, unsurprised to find him smiling
unapologetically.
“What?” He lifts his broad shoulders. “It's my lucky number.”
“Uh-huh,” I say, turning back to my daughter, who is practically
bouncing on her heels with excitement. “What'd he let you get?”
“Well, I got candy. Like, a lot of candy, because he said if I got some of
the same kind of stuff, it didn't count as more than one thing.”
Of course he said that. “How much is a lot?”
“Less than Halloween.”
“That's a terrible unit of measure,” Rosie mutters, and I agree.
“Plus, I got a Spiderman pajama set, two new books, a DVD about
when the Comets won the Cup, a new goalie stick, and so much more.”
“That sounds like—”
“The best thing ever? I know!” She claps her hands together. “I'm so
happy! He said it was a late Christmas gift.”
I want to point out that Miller already got her an incredible Christmas
gift—tickets to several Comets games, including the one tomorrow—but I
don't, not when she's as excited as she is. I should also tell Macie to maybe
not get used to being spoiled like that, but I can't bring myself to ruin her
high right now.
“That was really nice of him. Did you tell him thank you?”
“Her mom can't say it, so why should she?”
I glare at Rosie, who quickly turns her attention back to the dough she
abandoned, whistling like she didn't just say what she did.
“Duh, Mom. I even told him thirteen times.” She rolls her eyes, and
before I can yell at her for it, she runs off, sprinting toward the picnic table
where Miller set her bag of goodies.
Scout laughs, and I turn my glare her way.
She lifts her hands in the air. “Hey, I didn't say anything.”
“Yeah, but you're thinking it.”
“I'm just saying…you owe him.”
“I don't owe him anything.”
That's not true. I know it's not true. I should thank him. What kind of
example am I setting for my daughter if I can't even tell someone thanks for
doing something so huge for me? It's just…it's Greer. I don't want to give
him the satisfaction.
Not to mention I'm embarrassed there's even anything I have to thank
him for. What happened last night…I thought I was done feeling that
helpless, thought I was finished feeling like that. I don't want Greer, of all
people, to know I need to be rescued.
Scout's hand lands on my shoulder. “It doesn't make you weak to need
help,” she says softly, like she knows exactly where my mind has gone.
With a sigh, I say, “Fine. I'll do it.”
“Good.” Scout smiles proudly.
“Why do I feel like I missed something?” Miller asks, his eyes bouncing
between his girlfriend and me.
Scout waves her hand. “It's nothing.”
It's not nothing, though. I know that, and Scout knows it too. I promised
myself eight years ago I'd never indebt myself to someone again.
It looks like it might be time to break that promise.

GREER
Game days are my favorite days ever. The excitement that hums through me
from the moment I open my eyes is unlike any other high. I mean, I've
never actually been high, but I assume it's better. It has to be. I'm getting
paid to play hockey—how fucking incredible is that? How could anything
get better?
It can't. It's impossible.
“You really shouldn't frown like that. Your face is going to get stuck.”
I glance over at the idiot who has just flopped down on the bench next
to me. “Go away, Hayes.”
“What? I'm just saying, keep scowling, and you're screwed. You're
going to be as wrinkly as Coach before you're even thirty.”
“Wrinkly or not, I'll still be a better hockey player than you.”
He scoffs. “Please. You wish.”
“Why are you here?”
“Uh, because we have a game?”
“I mean here, talking to me. You know—”
“You hate being talked to before a game.” He rolls his eyes. “I know. I
just thought…”
“Ah, see, there's your first mistake, rookie—thinking.”
He glares at me. “The guys are right. You are a dick.”
I grin, wearing that badge with pride. “Thank you.” I let my smile fade.
“Now fuck off. I need to get ready.”
The kid saunters away, leaving me on my own, just how I like it.
Every guy has their own pregame routine, and shutting out the world is
mine. I don't like talking to people, not even my teammates. I don't want
music or television or any sort of distraction. The only thing I want to do is
sit here and just be.
It helps me get into the right headspace. It's what's helped me win eight
games in a row, and it's what's going to help us lift that Cup this season. I
can feel it in my bones. I'm definitely not going to let the fucking rookie
trip me up.
Not tonight.
I let my eyes fall closed as I rest my back against my cubby. The all-toofamiliar sounds in the room wash over me, and I take slow, deep breaths.
It's kind of like meditation, only there are about ten other dudes in here, it
smells like a disgusting locker room, and they have no fucking idea how to
shut up.
But…I love it. It's all part of playing the greatest game ever to exist.
Someone plops down next to me, and I know in an instant who it is.
“You have to stop being mean to the rookie. He's going to think you
don't like him.”
“I don't like him. Or you, for that matter.”
“That's a lie.”
“It's truly not, Miller. Please fuck off.”
He laughs, then slaps my thigh. “And miss an opportunity to annoy
you? Not a chance.”
I peel my eyes open, turning a heated glare his way. “Why are you
bothering me?”
“Because I like doing it.”
“How does Scout not smother you with a pillow?”
“Because it turns out I'm really good with my tongue.” He sticks said
tongue out, licking the air.
It's annoying…just like he is. I want him to go away, and I think I know
just how to make that happen.
“I heard a rumor…”
His brows rise. “About me?” He rubs his hands together. “I hope it's an
exciting one.”
“I think it is.” I cup my hands around my mouth. “Hey, Wright!”
The defenseman lifts his head across the room. “What's up?”
There's hesitation in his voice, and I get it. When I say I don't usually
talk to anyone before a game, that's not an exaggeration. I like the quiet, the
solitude, because I want to win, and that's why getting Miller far, far away
from me is so important.
“Did you know Miller made a list ranking all the guys on the team by
who's hottest, and you're number five?”
“Five?!”
“Oh crap,” Miller mutters, shrinking as Wright rises from his cubby,
stalking toward us.
“What the hell do you mean five, Miller? I am way hotter than the other
guys!”
“Hey! I take great offense to that,” Lowell chimes in.
I point to the captain. “He said you're hot because you're a daddy.”
“Like a daddy or a Daddy?” He bounces his brows up and down.
We all look to Miller for the answer. He doesn't respond. He can't. He's
too busy holding his breath and squeezing his eyes shut, pretending he
doesn't exist right now.
“He definitely meant Daddy. It's Miller. For the record, I'd like to be
left out of this list.”
“Too bad. You're number two.”
“Two?” Rhodes growls, sounding very much like he doesn't want to be
left out at all. “Then who is number one?”
“That would be me.” I smile proudly. “I'm number one, then Rhodes,
Fitz, Lowell, Wright.”
“Fitz is before me?” Lowell's mouth opens in shock. “What the hell
for?”
“Because of his missing tooth.” Miller shrugs. “It's cute.”
Fitz grins, poking his tongue through the hole. “I knew this would win
me some points.”
“Miller is right,” says Surkov, another forward. “My husband and I
made a list too. Just swap out Lowell for Wright and it's spot-on.”
“What!” Lowell explodes at the same time Wright yells out, “Ha! Suck
it!”
“I'm still hotter than both of you.” Rhodes grins, awfully proud of
himself.
“What are you smiling about?” I say to him. “I'm number one.”
“Yeah, number one pain in my ass.”
“He took my spot?” Miller presses a hand to his chest and juts his
bottom lip out. “I'm hurt. Truly.”
“You're an idiot. Truly,” Rhodes mocks.
“Nah. You love me.”
“I really, really don't.”
“Lies!” Miller says, rising from the bench to follow the defenseman,
who is now retreating from the room. He glances back at me, then peeks
around before holding his hand to the side of his mouth. “Also, your
vibrator is on,” he whispers.
What the…
“Did you just say what I think you did?”
“Hey, no judgment!” He holds his hands up. “But maybe turn it off so
you don't burn out the battery?”
“What the fuck are you on about? I—”
“There it is again.”
I'm about to tell him he's a complete idiot, but this time, I hear it.
“That's not my vibrator—which I don't even have—it's my phone.”
“Sure. Right.”
“Miller…” I growl, and that's all it takes for him to scramble away, off
to annoy someone else.
I pluck my phone from my bag, surprised I completely forgot to shut it
off. I'm two seconds from doing so, but it buzzes again.
It's my mother.
I should ignore it. I know I should. I have a game to focus on. I'm ready
to take our win streak to nine.
But if she's called me this many times, something has to be wrong,
right?
I slide my finger across the green button.
“Mom?”
“Oh, thank gosh! You finally answered!”
The way she rushes out the words in complete panic has me sitting
forward, now on high alert.
“What's wrong? Is everything okay?”
“No! Nothing is okay. The cake company I wanted to use says they're
booked for that weekend, and I had my heart set on their vanilla and
raspberry three-tier cake. It's the one I had when I married Archie, and I
want it again, not to mention my seamstress is a complete pain to nail
down. We're down to just one month. I need things done, Jacob.”
My jaw drops. “You called me about the wedding?”
“Of course I did.” She huffs. “I need to know your date's name for the
place cards.”
“Why?”
“Because I need to know who is sitting next to you! I'm trying to do this
one right.”
She wanted to do her other wedding “right,” too. And the one before
that. It's obvious how well those events turned out.
“Well?” my mother prompts when I don't answer.
“I don't have a date yet, Loretta.”
She sighs. “You're not distracting me with that.”
I chuckle because she knows me so well. If I ever want to change the
subject, I call her by her first name. She hates it when I do it and always
goes off on a tangent about how I shouldn't call her anything but Mom.
Guess I've used that strategy too many times, and she's onto me.
“And what do you mean you don't have a date yet? We have one month
until the wedding. One month!”
“Oh, really? I hadn't heard.” I roll my eyes even though she can't see
me, and it's a good thing, too, because that would definitely earn me a
smack to the back of my head.
“Don't roll your eyes at me, Jacob Greer.”
How the hell did she…
“Mom sense,” she answers, like that explains everything. “Please let me
know your date's name by Friday, or you're off the guest list.”
“Excuse me?”
“You heard me, son.”
“And do you mean it?”
She hesitates for a moment. “I mean it.”
“But I'm your dude of honor.”
It feels like tradition at this point. While my mother has plenty of
friends—being a hairdresser means she's a people person—I've still always
been the one to stand beside her. I refuse to let this wedding be any
different.
“I'll have a date by Friday.”
“You promise?”
“I promise, Loretta.”
“Jacob.” She sighs. “You're lucky you're my favorite kid. You know
that, right?”
“I'm your only kid, Mom.”
“That you know of. Your father, on the other hand, is obsessed with
procreating, so who knows if you're his favorite or not.”
I laugh because she's not wrong. My parents never married—a shocker
for them both—but they still went on to have several other long-term
relationships. While my mother prefers to marry her partners, my dad likes
to have kids with his. My mom may be going into her fourth marriage, but
my dad has her beat—he's on kid number six.
“Lucas is killing it on points this season. He's probably the favorite.”
My half brother plays hockey too. He's a forward for St. Louis, and I
love playing him because as hard as he tries, he can't crack me.
“Don't be like that, Jacob. Your father loves all his kids equally.”
I have to hand it to my mother. No matter how often my father has
moved on with a different woman or a different family, she has never said a
bad word about him. In fact, it's the opposite—she praises him for being
such a good father, and she's not wrong. He's attentive to us and always
wants to make sure none of us feel left out, which I don't. I know my dad is
proud of me. I also know he's a huge fan of competition, and even though
the Comets are on a hot streak right now, my brother had a four-point night
two games ago. He's definitely Dad's favorite at the moment.
“Oh!” my mother exclaims. “Your game! You're playing tonight. Why
am I bothering you? Oh gosh, I'm the worst mother ever.”
“You're not. You're just excited about the wedding.”
She sighs wistfully. “I really am. Is that silly? I've done this so many
times. I should be over it by now.”
“Nah, Mom. It's not silly.”
“I just…I love him so much. He makes me happy. I really feel like this
could be the one, you know?”
This is the same speech she's given me multiple times over the years, so
it's a little hard to muster up the same enthusiasm she has. I'm glad my
mother is happy, but I'm not really excited about the inevitable heartbreak
that's going to follow when this marriage fails just like the others. It's hard
to watch over and over again.
Do I hope this one actually is the one? Sure, but do I have much hope
that it is? Well, no. I'm sure that makes me an awful son to some, but to me,
it's just being realistic. When you've grown up seeing it constantly happen,
hope is something that goes out the window rather quickly.
“I'm glad, Mom.”
Another soft sigh. “I'm sorry I haven't been able to make it stick for
you. It wasn't fair to ask you to grow up with so many men in and out of
your life.”
I don't say anything because I'm not sure what to say. It's no big deal? I
learned to keep myself distant from everyone? I don't believe in love at all?
I can't break her heart like that.
“Oh my gosh! I'm a terrible mother. Here I am bothering you about all
this stuff when you have a game tonight.”
That's right, bring it back around to hockey. Keep feelings and shit out
of it.
“It's fine, but I really should be going. We have to hit warmups soon.”
“Of course, of course. Thanks for making time for your old mom. Go
kick some ass, son.”
“I'll try. Love you.”
“But never as much as I love you.”
I grin. It's the same thing she's always said to me, and it always brings
me that same warmness no matter how many times I hear it.
“Friday,” she says once again as a reminder.
“Friday,” I echo.
I hit the red button, then relax against my cubby.
So much for no distractions before the game.
“I have no damn clue how we pulled that out of our asses, but we'll take the
two points. Eight AM ice time tomorrow.”
It's all Coach Heller says before he walks out of the room. He's
disappointed, and I don't blame him.
I'm disappointed, too, especially in myself. I played like shit out there.
My focus was completely gone, which resulted in me giving up sloppy
goals. Sure, we got two points, and yeah, it might have been fun for fans to
watch the back and forth, but it was a terrible performance by our entire
club.
“Fuck, that sucked.” Our team captain sinks down next to me. “Like
really, really sucked.”
“It was my fault.”
“Not true,” Rhodes says to me. “That was on me.”
“I let so many pucks skip over my blade.” Wright shakes his head.
“Played like complete shit.”
“I was amazing. I got two goals and an assist,” Miller says, clearly
proud of himself. He should be; he did play well.
“Quit with the fucking pity party,” a loud voice booms through the
room.
Every head in the room snaps toward Smith, who is standing with his
hands on his hips, looking like a dad ready to tell his kids he's not mad, just
disappointed.
“You all could have been better.”
“I—”
“Missed two practically empty nets.” Smith interrupts Miller, who was
just about to pat himself on the back again. “Every single one of you skated
slow. You didn't finish your checks, and you battled the boards like it was
your first damn game. You sucked, plain and simple, but it's not the first
time and won't be the last. Take the two points and get the fuck over it. Get
your shit ready because we have another game on Tuesday against the top
defense in the league. We need the points more than they do, so whatever
made you all play like shit tonight, figure it out and leave it in the damn
locker room next time.”
He spins on his heel and disappears out the door.
“Damn, I miss playing with that old grump,” Miller comments.
The rest of us are quiet because we know he's right. It was a team effort
—or lack thereof—tonight. We just have to figure it out.
Me especially.
Mom: Sorry about the game. I can't help but think it might
have been my phone call that threw you off.
I scoff. I can't say it's definitely my mom's fault, but she didn't help.
Mom: But please remember…Friday.
Mom: Love you!
With a groan, I toss my phone back into the cubby, the same feeling of
dread that filled my stomach before the game hitting me again. I have to get
this date thing figured out.
Tomorrow. I'll fix it tomorrow.

STEVIE
“Ughhh.”
I try my hardest not to roll my eyes at my ten-year-old daughter. She has
been sighing nonstop since the end of the shootout last night.
The Comets, who have been doing incredible, struggled against the
team that's currently ranked last in the league and came entirely too close to
losing. She's convinced they will tank their entire season and miss the
playoffs now. I've been trying to tell her it's just one game, one bad
performance, but she's not buying it.
Hence the eighth sigh of the morning—and it's only seven AM.
“Macie, you're killing me.”
“Well, we're even, then, because the Comets are killing me, Mom.”
Another sigh, another dramatic toss of her head.
When did she get so theatrical?
“They won, though, didn't they?”
She gives me an incredulous look. “Yes, but they should have played…
well, better!” She raises her hands in the air. It's cute and a little funny but
also slightly annoying.
“Okay, well, they will next game. It'll be fine.”
“Fine? Fine? It needs to be better than fine! I want to see them win the
Cup again!”
She drops herself back onto the bench, her head resting on her
backpack. I have to leave to take her to school in about ten minutes, and I'm
betting I'll get at least three more sighs before then.
I attempt to placate her. “Everyone wants to see them win again, and
they will.”
She huffs, and I chuckle, turning my attention back to the coffee pot I'm
working on refilling. I want to make sure the truck is prepped for Rosie
while I'm fighting the school drop-off line.
“Everyone, huh? Does that mean you?”
Macie springs off the bench at the same minute I nearly drop the coffee
pot.
Where the hell did he come from?
I peek up to find Greer strutting toward the truck. He's close, giving me
zero time to hide or pretend I don't see him, and I really don't want to see
him. The last two times I ran across him, it wasn't pleasant, and with my
daughter being her sassy little self, I'm not sure I'm up to dealing with it
today.
“You!”
Speaking of my kid…
Macie jumps off the picnic table, her finger pointed directly at Greer,
who stops in his tracks.
“This is all your fault!”
His brows go up. “What exactly is my fault?”
“That game!”
I can see Greer's shoulders deflate from here. Ah, so he's upset about
them barely coming out with two points too.
“You guys barely showed up for twenty minutes. It was pitiful.”
“Macie!”
Greer holds his hand up toward me, his attention still on my kid, who is
now standing just a foot away from him, her little finger still pointed at him
and a scowl that could rival his on her face.
“What could we have done better?”
“Everything!” She throws her hands into the air. “Literally everything.
The passing, the skating, the goaltending.” That last word is punctuated
with a glare that would probably have any other grown man trembling.
Not Greer, though. He just stares back at her, eyes sharp and serious as
she continues going over what they could work on. He's listening to her.
Like actually listening to her.
It's weird. I'm not sure I've ever seen Greer so serious about something,
and that's saying something because he is always serious.
She lets the pro-hockey player know if the team passed just a few beats
faster, they'd hit the tape every time. If they didn't get stuck in their own
zone for so long, they could take shorter shifts, allowing them to skate
harder and faster and beat the other team to the puck or at board battles. If
they hadn't kept feeding the puck to the goalie's right and instead went to
the left, they could have capitalized on it being his weak side and scored top
shelf without breaking a sweat.
I admittedly have no clue what she's talking about, but Greer clearly
does because he nods when she's done telling him all that.
Then finally, he says, “So you think his left is his weak side?”
“Yes! And it's yours too, especially if they're shooting just above the
pads. You leave too much space open. A puck can squeak in there like that.”
She snaps on the last word for emphasis.
Greer nods again. “I think you're right.”
Macie's eyes light up. “I am?” She clears her throat, pushing out her
chest. “I mean, I am. I'm right. So tighten it up out there.”
There's the slightest twitch to Greer's lips, but it's gone as quickly as it
appeared.
“Duly noted.”
Her brows squeeze together, clearly not understanding what he's said,
but he's already walking away from her and toward the truck before she can
ask him. He approaches the window, the annoying cocky smirk that I hate
lining his lips.
“Steve.”
I level him with a blank stare. “Greer.”
“Nice kid you have there.”
I raise a brow, daring him to say anything even remotely awful about
my daughter.
He doesn't.
“What do you want.”
“Some hospitality would be good.”
“Damn, we're all out of that.”
“I guess I'll have to settle for an iced coffee, then.”
I turn to make his drink, annoyed with myself for remembering his
order from the other day.
“You know, your daughter sure does have a lot to say about my
performance.”
“She's a big hockey nut,” I tell him as I pour the coffee into the to-go
cup.
“I can tell. She come to the games ever?”
“Sometimes, whenever I get time off. Miller hooked her up with some
tickets.”
“You'll have to tell me when. Maybe we can get the backup goalie in
the net for her critiquing and get him on a hot streak too.”
“Didn't look like you were on too much of a streak last night,” I
comment, sliding his finished drink in front of him.
His perpetual scowl deepens. “Coach Heller Jr. over there is right. I
played like shit.”
“Why?”
The word tumbles out of my mouth before I can stop it. I don't really
care why Greer had an off night…do I?
He lets out a long sigh, long enough to rival the ones Macie's been
letting out all morning. “Phone call gone wrong.”
“You took a phone call before the game?”
He tips his head like he's wondering why I'm questioning him on that.
I shrug. “Miller has pregame routines he's gone through with Macie
before. I know some players are stringent about not having their phones on
before games.”
He nods once. “I usually don't, but I guess I didn't turn the volume all
the way off. It buzzed, so I answered.”
“Someone important?”
“My mother.”
“Momma's boy?” I can't help the grin that slips across my face.
He narrows his eyes. “No.”
“Sure.”
“I'm not,” he insists, and I love how it's clearly riling him up. “She's
getting married.”
“Oh. Well, congratulations to her. Hope it lasts longer than my marriage
did.”
He snorts. “Doubt it. She's determined to Elizabeth-Taylor life.”
I tip my head, unsure of what he means.
“It's her fourth.”
“Oh.” I was only married once and it was brief, but that experience was
so awful that I'm not sure I could do it again, let alone four times.
“Yeah.” He drags a hand through his dark hair, the slight wave to it
flattening for only a moment before it goes back to its normal disarray. “I'm
sort of in a jam with it.”
“With the wedding? Is it during the season or something?”
“Yeah, but that's not the problem. She lives here, and she planned so I'd
be home for it. It's something else, something…”
He trails off, a dark look crossing his face.
“That bad?”
“A date.”
“Huh?”
He looks up at me. “She wants me to bring a date to the wedding.”
“Is that all?”
He gives me a disbelieving look. “What do you mean, is that all? I don't
date.”
“Ever?”
He shakes his head. “Ever.”
“That's…surprising.”
“How so?”
“I don't know.” I shrug. “You're a hockey player—aren't you all
supposed to be slinging your man bits around and hooking up with women
hanging around the rink?”
“Man bits?”
I flick my eyes toward my daughter, who is sitting far enough away that
she shouldn't hear this conversation, but I don't trust it all the same. There
have been many times I thought I was being sneaky with a conversation,
only for her to have heard every word, including when I spilled the beans
that Santa wasn't real. It was a mess, and I don't want to risk that again.
“No, I am not slinging my man bits all over or screwing around with
anyone. I've learned my lesson there, thank you very much.”
Interesting…
“So, no dating?” I ask.
“No dating. Except for this, apparently.” He groans, dropping his head
to his hands.
I roll my eyes. He's as bad as Macie with the dramatics. “It's not that
bad. It's just a date.”
“A date is always more than just a date. It's an expectation.”
“Of?”
“Everything!” His voice comes out loud and high-pitched, something
I've never heard from him. “They'll want flowers and doors opened for
them, an expensive dinner. Then they'll want me to walk them to their door
at the end of the night. They'll want a kiss and a phone call. It's everything I
don't want to deal with—everything I don't have time to deal with.”
“Oh nooo, you'll need to be a gentleman. How awful for you.”
“It truly is. You wouldn't want any of that because you're you.”
I want to take offense to that, but he's right. I wouldn't want any of that,
especially not with him.
Greer shoves a hand through his hair, turning it into more of a mess than
it already is. He looks around the empty lot. If he had come just ten minutes
earlier, this place would have been packed, but everyone's already on their
way to the office, leaving just Macie and us.
He takes a few sips of his coffee, then faces me again. “You're being
nice to me today. Haven't told me to leave once. Why?”
“Am I?” I need something to busy my hands with, anything at all, so I
grab the nearest rag and begin wiping down the countertop that's
completely spotless. “I hadn't noticed.”
That's a lie. I definitely noticed. Greer and I have never spoken this
much before, at least not without an insult being thrown.
“Hang on…is this your way of thanking me? By being nice to me?”
Okay, so maybe subconsciously, that's what I'm doing.
But also, Greer intrigues me. He's just always so…unpleasant to be
around. I want to know why. Plus, he damn near broke my kid's heart last
night, and I'm eager to figure out what's bothering him so maybe it won't
affect his game any longer.
“I guess so.”
“I can think of a better way for you to thank me.”
I rear back, curling my lips up. “That is never going to happen.”
“What? You think I mean…” He leans in closer. “Sex?” He throws his
head back, laughing and making me want to reach over the counter and slap
him. “No. Definitely no. But I'm flattered that's where your mind went.”
No? What the hell does he mean definitely no? I don't want to sleep
with him either, but definitely no? And said so sternly?
Screw him.
I glower at him and his stupid smiling face. “You can leave now, Greer.”
“But you haven't heard my proposal.”
“And I really don't want to.”
“Oh, but I think you do.” He points toward my daughter, who is back to
lying on the bench of the picnic table, her face stuck in some hockey book.
“It will benefit her.”
“How?”
“Free tickets to games.”
“Miller already beat you to that. Besides, we're perfectly capable of
buying our own, but thanks for insinuating I can't afford that.”
“I wasn't…” He shakes his head. “Never mind. But if free tickets are
off the table, how about jerseys?”
“Yours?” Now it's my turn to laugh. “She wouldn't want that. Trust
me.”
“She hates me that much?”
I lift my shoulders. “Guess she has good taste.”
“Okay, fine, not mine. Other jerseys.”
“I can buy her jerseys.”
He groans. “You're really killing me here.”
“Am I? Because you're offering up a lot of stuff but not telling me what
you'd want in exchange.”
“A date.”
I stop scrubbing at the already clean counter and lift my eyes to him.
“Excuse me?”
“Be my date for the wedding.”
“Don't make me gag.”
“Be my date for the wedding,” he repeats.
Holy shit. He's serious. He's like really serious.
“No. Absolutely not.”
“Why not?” If I didn't know any better, I'd say he's offended by me not
falling at his feet.
“Well, for starters, I don't even like you.”
“That's unfair.”
“Is it, though? You're not exactly the nicest guy ever.”
“I saved you.”
That's the reminder I didn't want.
“You know, it doesn't really count as a nice gesture if all you're going
to do is throw it in my face.”
“That's fair,” he says, his concession surprising me. “But you do owe
me.”
“I do not. I already said thank you.”
“Except you didn't. You were just nice to me, which isn't the same
thing.”
Crap. He has me there.
“How about this: if you'll be my date, I won't make you say thank you.”
“How about this: I'm not saying thank you because I didn't ask for your
help. I don't need you or anyone else to step in and rescue me like some
helpless princess.”
He holds his hands up, the ice in his now half-empty cup jiggling
around. “All right. Calm down, Kelly Clarkson.”
I lift my brows, unimpressed by his reference. “Again, go away, Greer.”
“I'll coach her.”
“Huh?”
He nods toward Macie, who is still completely wrapped up in her book.
“I'll coach her. She's a hockey fiend, right? I'm assuming you have her
signed up for the youth league. I'll coach her.”
“Do you have time for that?”
“No.”
“Then I––”
“I'll make time.”
“Greer…”
“Steve…” he says in the same tone, and I want to yell at him for calling
me Steve. Only Scout can do that, and she's not supposed to do it either.
That nickname was reserved for my father, who passed away a few years
ago. She's just lucky I like her.
Macie shuffles around on the table, and I drag my gaze back to my
daughter, who doesn't know I'm having a conversation that could change
her entire life.
I didn't sign her up for the youth league. She mentioned she wanted to
play, but I know hockey isn't cheap. I'm also not sure I'd have the time to
take her to and from games. I'm only one person.
But if Greer is offering, it means she'd be getting training from a
professional, something she probably needs since she's ten and already
behind the other kids who have been playing for years. She'd have an
honest-to-God expert teaching her, something I'd never be able to afford.
She would love it, even if it is Greer.
I'd be a fool to pass up this opportunity for my daughter, especially
when it's going to cost me just one night of my life. What's the worst that
could happen? I get free drinks and dance by myself? I can deal with that.
“Come on,” Greer says. “I'm desperate here.”
“Wow. Way to make a girl feel special.”
“If I were you, I'd take it as a compliment that I'd rather spend my night
with you than some woman I'd definitely be falling into bed with
afterward.”
Images of Greer and me wrapped up in silk sheets—he's rich, so I
assume they're silk—assault my mind. Worse, between my legs…
I give myself a shake, refusing to let it continue any longer. It's Greer,
for shit's sake. I'm not interested in him at all. It's just because I haven't
been with anyone in a long time. That's all.
“Okay, if this is happening—and I haven't said yes yet—we need rules,
and that's number one. I am not sleeping with you.”
“Why do you have to say it like that?” he asks.
“Like it's the most disgusting thing I could ever think of?” He nods.
“Because it is.”
He grabs his chest, taking a stumbling step backward. His feet dragging
across the gravel has Macie lifting her head, her eyes narrowing on us like
she's trying to figure out what's going on. It only lasts a second before her
nose is buried back in her book.
“That's the meanest thing you've ever said to me, and that's saying
something.”
“Trust me, Greer, I've bitten my tongue around you a lot. I have a lot of
meaner things I could say.”
“Please.” He steps back up to the counter. “Tell me what I did to make
you hate me so much.”
“For starters, you're mean to my daughter.”
“She's mean to me.”
“You're upset a ten-year-old chirped you?”
“I'm just happy you know what chirping is. You're going to make a
great hockey mom.”
“A hockey mom? Why are you a hockey mom?”
Greer and I both jump at the sudden intrusion that is Macie. I didn't
even see her get up.
“Mom?” she asks impatiently when neither of us answers. “Why are
you a hockey mom?”
She looks between me and the NHL goalie, her eyes brighter than I've
ever seen them before, and that includes this last Christmas when Miller
surprised her with all those tickets.
“She's signing you up for hockey.”
“You are?!” Macie's little voice rises about two octaves, and her feet
come off the ground as she bounces up and down several times.
“And I'm going to coach you.”
The bouncing comes to an immediate halt as she stares up at Greer, her
brows pinched tightly together. “You are?”
“Well, shit, don't sound so excited about it.”
“You can't say shit. You can say ass if you put jack in front of it, but
you can't say shit.”
“You just said shit twice,” Greer points out.
Her eyes widen as she looks up at me, terrified she's about to get in
trouble.
“Leave her alone, Greer.”
“Yeah, leave me alone, Greer,” Macie tells him, crossing her arms,
looking mighty proud of herself.
“That's about to be Coach Greer to you.”
Then, because he's a grown-ass adult, he sticks his tongue out at her.
I shake my head at their antics. “Glad to see this relationship is off to a
great start.”
“Does that mean yes?” Greer gazes up at me with hopeful eyes. I've
never seen him look this desperate before. I want to say no to spite him.
“Yeah, does that mean you're really signing me up for hockey, Mom?”
Crap. I can't say no to Macie when she looks even more desperate for a
yes than Greer does.
Do I have the time for hockey? Well, with my other job probably laying
me off soon, yes…at least until I find something else.
Maybe we scrimp for a few months. Maybe we cut back on other
activities, eat out less—not that we do that often now, but still. Hockey is
important to Macie, and Macie is important to me. I want her to be happy. I
want her to get everything she wants in life.
I can do this for her.
It's just one date with Greer. I can survive that…right?
With a sigh, I say, “Yes. The answer is yes.”
“Yes!” Macie throws her hands in the air, jumping up and down over
and over. “I'm going to play hockey!”
Greer watches her, and if I'm not mistaken, his lips twitch, clearly
amused by her happiness. He nods toward her as she jumps away—literally
—and says, “Her enthusiasm? That's what's happening on the inside for
me.”
“You're the grumpiest person I've ever met, so I highly doubt you've
ever been that excited in your entire life.”
“One, you've met Smith, and he's far grumpier than me. Two, I have
too been that excited.”
“Name a time.”
“I got tickets to see The Lord of the Rings at midnight once. Best night
of my life.”
“Including when you lost your virginity last month?”
“Hey, I'm not Miller.”
“You're right. He's prettier.”
His eyes narrow, but it's not his usual pouty look. Instead, it's
something…else.
Before I can speculate any more, he changes the subject. “So, date—
us.”
I sigh at the reminder. For a brief second, I forgot about my end of the
bargain. “Unfortunately.”
A smirk pulls at his lips like he's enjoying my pain. “You're going to
have fun.”
“I doubt that.”
He taps the counter twice. “I'll be in touch, Steve.”
“Oh joy.”
Another smirk.
He turns and heads for the parking lot, but not before throwing a wave
at Macie, who is still doing a little dance.
“Get some gear. You'll need it.”
“Okay.”
“And nice braces,” he calls to her over his shoulder as he heads toward
the parking lot.
Macie, used to assholes picking on her, flashes him a big smile.
“They're Comets colors, but another game like last night and I'm getting
them changed!”
I swear I hear Greer laugh.
What the hell did I get myself into?

GREER & STEVIE
Greer: When are you available?
Stevie: Who is this?
Greer: Your favorite person on the entire planet.
Stevie: Greer?
Greer: I knew you liked me.
Stevie: I really, really don't.
Greer: Keep telling yourself that, Steve.
Stevie: Stevie. S-T-E-V-I-E! It's not that hard.
Stevie: Again, what do you want?
Greer: To set a date.
Stevie: We already did.
Greer: Not OUR date. I mean a date for the first training
session.
Greer: I am flattered that you're so excited about our date.
Can't stop thinking about it, huh?
Stevie: Can't stop thinking about what I'm sure is going to be
the most embarrassing moment of my life? Yes.
Greer: You think telling people you're dating me is
embarrassing?
Stevie: Yes.
Stevie: Now stop being annoying and just get to the point of
the conversation.
Greer: Ooooh. Someone's testy.
Greer: I kind of like seeing you get all worked up, especially
over me.
Stevie: Greer…
Greer: Fine.
Greer: We have practice tomorrow morning. If you two want to
come and check things out, we can do a trial run after.
Stevie: A trial run? I thought this was part of the agreement.
You teach Macie, and I'll be your date.
Stevie: No trial runs.
Greer: What if we aren't compatible? What if she bites me?
Stevie: She's ten. She's not going to bite you.
Greer: I was a ten-year-old biter.
Stevie: Why does that not surprise me?
Stevie: She won't bite you. I promise.
Greer: I'm not so sure I believe you. You don't even like me.
You probably want me to be bitten.
Stevie: I never said I didn't like you.
Greer: Yes, you did. Multiple times even.
Stevie: Fine, I don't like you.
Stevie: But I'm not lying. She won't bite you. She hasn't bitten
anyone in like six months or something.
Greer: Wow. I am SO glad I get to test out her biting sobriety
like this.
Stevie: To be fair, that kid bit her first.
Greer: Your daughter sounds scary.
Stevie: She can be.
Stevie: But she won't bite you.
Greer: Promises, promises.
Stevie: How much time do I need to block out?
Greer: At least two hours.
Stevie: Wait—are we watching you practice too?
Greer: Yes.
Stevie: Why?
Greer: It might be good for her to see a professional practice
before getting on the ice.
Stevie: Oh. That makes sense.
Greer: We good, then?
Stevie: Just one more thing…
Stevie: How'd you get this number?
Greer: I have my ways.
Stevie: Miller?
Greer: Maybe.
Greer: Why?
Stevie: Just needed to know how big I should dig the grave.
Greer: Your daughter scares me, but you scare me more.
Stevie: Good.
Stevie: What kind of equipment should I bring?
Greer: Well, skates are a must.
Stevie: Anything else?
Greer: No. We'll start with just skates. We have some sticks
and pucks she can play around with at the practice rink.
Greer: I really just want to get a feel for where she's at.
Stevie: She's at zero.
Greer: Meaning?
Stevie: She's, uh, never played before.
Greer: At all?
Stevie: No.
Stevie: Well, she's played on rollerblades, but not on the ice.
Greer: Oh god.
Stevie: Surprise?
Greer: Yeah, big surprise.
Greer: This is going to be a lot of work.
Stevie: She's willing to learn.
Stevie: She's been practicing since yesterday.
Stevie: I also got called into the principal's office yesterday
because she got into a shoving match with some boy who
didn't believe she's going to be training with you.
Stevie: “Great, Mom! My first trip to the sin bin! Goalies don't
go to the sin bin!”
Stevie: That's what she told me yesterday.
Greer: She's right. Someone else takes the brunt of the
punishment for us.
Greer: Trust me, though, it feels just as bad as sitting in there
yourself.
Stevie: Goalies don't get in trouble?
Greer: Oh, we do.
Greer: There are some meathead goalies out there. They do
some stupid shit.
Greer: We take penalties but don't have to serve them.
Someone who was on the ice when we took the penalty does,
so not only is your coach pissed at you, your teammates are
too. It sucks.
Stevie: Have you ever been in trouble?
Greer: Plenty of times.
Stevie: What for?
Greer: Tripping. Slashing. Roughing on that fucker Colter.
Even got me a game misconduct once when I first started in
the league.
Greer: Not yet been in a goalie fight, though it's on my bucket
list.
Stevie: Hockey players are so weird.
Greer: And goalies are even weirder. We're a different breed.
Stevie: And to think my kid wants to be one.
Greer: She's got the fire, that's for sure.
Greer: Just bring the skates. I'll take care of the rest.
Stevie: Aye, aye, captain.
Greer: I CAN'T HEAR YOU!
Stevie: What?
Greer: Oh. I thought we were doing a SpongeBob thing.
Never mind.
Stevie: Ooooooooh.
Greer: WHO LIVES IN A PINEAPPLE UNDER THE SEA?
Stevie: We're still not doing it.
Greer: Right.
Greer: See you tomorrow.
Stevie: Unfortunately.
Stevie: What time should we be there?
Greer: You have got to be kidding me.
Stevie: What?
Greer: It's 5 fucking AM.
Stevie: It's 5:15, thank you.
Stevie: And good morning.
Stevie: What time should we be there?
Greer: Are you always up this early?
Stevie: Pretty much. Sometimes when I'm feeling feisty, I
sleep in until 5:30, but that's a rarity.
Greer: I hate you.
Stevie: Hey, that's my line!
Stevie: So…time?
Greer: 9 AM.
Greer: I'll need a little bit afterward, but I'll meet you on the ice
within fifteen minutes.
Stevie: Gotta see your groupies first?
Greer: Puck bunnies.
Stevie: What about bunnies?
Greer: That's what hockey groupies are called. Puck bunnies.
Stevie: Oh. They sound so cute.
Greer: They really aren't.
Stevie: Uh-oh. Bad experience?
Greer: Hell no. I'm not stupid enough to get swept up in that
shitstorm. I've had some clingers though, and that was terrible
enough.
Stevie: Ah, that's right. You're anti-love.
Greer: Who said I was anti-love?
Stevie: You did. And I quote, “It's a crock of shit.” I don't even
know what a crock means, but that's what you said.
Greer: It's really too early for this.
Stevie: Go back to sleep, your highness.
Greer: Highness? What am I, a king?
Stevie: Just of hell.
Greer: Now, Steve, don't go getting all sweet on me. I'll start
thinking you like me or something.
Stevie: That'll never happen.
Stevie: And for the millionth time, it's STEVIE.
Greer: Until you start being nicer to me, it's Steve.
Stevie: That's mean.
Greer: And so are you, so I guess we're even.
Stevie: I'm rolling my eyes really hard at the grown man I've
seen be a dick numerous times calling me mean.
Greer: You started it.
Stevie: Are you five?
Greer: No. You just bring out the worst in me.
Stevie: Lovely.
Stevie: Go back to sleep, Greer. I need you rested so you can
teach my kid.
Greer: I'm already awake now. Might as well start my day.
Stevie: You're welcome. And who knows, maybe you'll like
getting up early. It's refreshing to start your day early.
Greer: Not when it's still dark outside, it's not.
Stevie: You're awfully dramatic.
Greer: You'll get used to it.
Stevie: Oh, I have. Hello, ten-year-old daughter, remember?
Greer: She's not going to be dramatic on the ice, is she?
Stevie: Not sure. But if she is, it's your problem.
Greer: Don't smile at that!
Stevie: Sorry. Can't talk. Things to do.
Greer: Evil woman.
Stevie: *smiles*

GREER
“All right. I noticed during the last game that you were struggling with your
blocker side, so I want to focus on that today.” Bill, my goalie coach, bangs
his stick on the ice a few times before skating backward and firing a shot at
me without warning.
I miss it.
I really shouldn't miss it. I should be alert. I should see it, should know
it's coming, but it still goes flying past me and into the net.
I can hear the goal horn ringing in my head. See the red light lit up,
showing that the other team scored. Envision all our hopes and dreams for
making a Cup run going right out the window.
“Don't do that, Greer. Don't beat yourself up for missing one puck.”
“But one puck is all it takes,” I argue back, annoyed with myself,
annoyed that he can tell I'm already thinking negatively.
“Yeah, that can definitely be true, but it's not the end of the world.”
“Could be the end of my career,” I mumble, grateful for my mask that
luckily blocks my words. Bill would have my ass if he heard that, and I
don't blame him.
I shouldn't let it bother me. I'm not going to block and save everything.
There are just some days it bothers me more than others.
I can't help but wonder if today it's because there are two sets of eyes in
the stands watching me. I don't even have to look up to know she's
watching because I can feel it—that's how hard Stevie is staring at me right
now. Macie too.
I'm used to spectators coming and watching during practice. It happens
all the time, but this time…it feels different with them here. I'm sure it's
just because I'm coaching Macie after this and want to make a good
impression—so she doesn't bite me, obviously.
Yeah, that has to be it. That's why I'm so worked up. I just need to get
them out of my head is all.
I take a deep breath, then another. I nod to tell Bill I'm ready, then get
set as he skates farther away. He pulls the stick back and shoots.
He turns his hands at the last split second, and the puck goes where I'm
not expecting.
I make the block.
“Good!” he calls out. “Again!”
He winds up and fires.
I block.
Again.
I block.
Again.
I miss.
“Fuck!” I skate out of my goal crease and wander the ice a bit,
murmuring to myself. “Come on, man. Don't get mad at missing one. It's
fine. You're fine. Don't let this shit get in your head. You've seen it happen
too many times to too many good goalies. They let in a few soft goals, and
suddenly they're on a bad streak. You fucking got this.”
I beat my chest with my glove a few times and take some deep breaths.
I skate back to the net, plant my skates where I want them, and hunker
down, ready to defend.
Bill fires ten shots my way.
I block them all.
We keep going, this time with my teammates jumping into the mix,
firing puck after puck my way. They get up in the crease, smothering me
and battling for the puck. I let a few more goals in, but they don't bother me
like earlier. I'm calmer and more collected. I feel confident and ready.
I'm not saying maybe Stevie was right about getting up early, but
there's no way being up and having over half of my to-do list knocked out
before hitting the ice is just a coincidence. I don't feel like there's anything
niggling at the back of my mind, and it's allowing me to get recentered
quickly.
Maybe the evil woman was right.
A whistle sounds, pulling me out of my head and back into practice.
“Boys!”
The whole team skates to the middle of the ice where Coach Heller is. A
few of us take a knee while some of us stand, but we all have our eyes
trained on our coach. He's not the biggest of guys, but he sure as hell knows
how to command a room. When I learned I was signing with the Comets,
the first thing I did was hit YouTube and look up my new coach.
He's a fucking beast. Probably one of the best goons the league has ever
seen. More penalty minutes than I could ever dream of. When he was
actually on the ice, he assisted on quite a few plays too. All around a solid
player.
Now, he's a damn good coach.
“We're looking good in the standings, and we're on a homestand, where
we know we play well—but all of that is no reason to take our foot off the
gas. We may have walked away with two points, but our last game was
sloppy. We looked better today, but there's always room for improvement,
and that's what we need to do—keep improving. We want to pad the points.
We need to pad our points. Then we want to head into the playoffs feeling
good, feeling ready. So give it your all out there, boys. Nothing in this
league comes easy, and no lead is safe, not even ours.”
He looks us each in the eye, nods once, then skates off. Practice is over
for the day.
“I have a few quick things to go over, then you're free,” the assistant
coach says. “Practice tomorrow morning is optional. I need you to…”
He goes on for a few minutes about what we need to work on, who
needs to see the team docs, who needs to hit the weights. After he's done
with his spiel, we're cut loose.
“Hey, we're thinking of hitting up The Madhouse for grub. You in?”
Miller asks. “Scout's writing today, so I want to stay out of her hair.”
“Go out in public with you? I'm good.”
“Hey, we've been in public together before.”
“Your girlfriend's donut truck doesn't count.”
“Does too,” he mutters.
“Besides, I'm busy.”
“Doing what? Being grumpy at the wall?”
“Hey, if the wall has it coming, it has it coming.”
He looks genuinely confused, so I roll my eyes.
“I have plans.”
I look toward the area that's slowly emptying out. There are a few
stragglers—there always are—who are trying to get pictures, pucks, and
sticks. Then sitting up at the back of the bleachers are Stevie and Macie.
The kid looks like she's about to fly out of her seat, her little legs bouncing
up and down with excitement.
I swear I see Stevie say to her, “Not yet.”
“Wait…are they not here for me?”
“Nope.”
“What the hell, ladies?” Miller yells, throwing his hands up in the air,
apparently not caring that he looks like a complete idiot.
Stevie exaggerates a shoulder shrug, and then Miller shakes his fist at
her. She laughs, and it's a genuine laugh.
I'm not sure I've ever seen a genuine laugh from her, but I am really
sure I don't like that it's Miller making her do it.
“Don't you have somewhere to be?” I say to him, but even I hear it
come out as more of a growl.
If he does, he doesn't show it. He just grins at me with that obnoxious,
toothy, golden-retriever-energy grin he's always sporting and chuckles.
“Aw, don't sound so sad I'm leaving you.”
“Trust me, I'm not.”
“What are you doing with them anyway?”
“Coaching.”
His eyes widen. “You're coaching a kid? But you hate kids.”
“I don't hate kids,” I mutter. “I just don't particularly like them.”
“That's hating them.”
“Not entirely.”
“Macie's a good kid, though. No need to hate her.”
“I'll have to remember that.”
He takes a step toward me, his eyes never leaving mine. “Be sure you
do, because they're good people, Macie and Stevie. Some of my favorites,
actually. I like them a lot more than I like other people.”
It's a threat. It's a little veiled, but the message is there all the same: if I
hurt Stevie or Macie, Miller is going to hurt me.
“You hear me?” he asks.
I nod. “I hear you.”
“Good.” And just like that, his perfect grin slips back into place as he
puts distance between us once more. His hand lands on my shoulder. “See
you tomorrow, man.”
Then he skates off, catching up with Hayes. The two laugh all the way
off the ice.
I don't usually see that side of Miller—in fact, I don't think I ever have
—and it kind of makes me respect the guy more. It's what I would do if I
had someone I cared about.
I glance back up the bleachers at where Stevie and Macie are sitting, but
they're not there anymore. Instead, they're making their way down toward
the ice.
I give them a wave to get their attention. Stevie tips her head at me, and
I point toward the locker room and hold up my hand.
Five minutes, I mouth.
She nods, then lifts the skates in her hand. They're not the greatest
quality, but they'll do for now. Maybe if today goes well and I don't get
bitten, I'll buy Macie a better pair.
I head for the locker room, stripping off some of my gear on the way
there. A few people try to stop me along the way—mostly Hayes and Fitz—
but I ignore them, trying to get my shit together so I can get this training
session over with as fast as possible.
After I get changed, I spritz myself with some cologne, covering up the
stench and feeling like I'm in high school all over again.
At least it's not Axe, I tell myself.
I make sure to let George, the rink manager, know I'm going to be using
the ice for a bit. He's perfectly fine with it, not that I thought he wouldn't
be.
Macie and Stevie are sitting right beside the tunnel when I come out.
“Oh my gosh,” Macie rushes out. “I am like sooooooo excited.” She
claps her hands together and attempts to jump up and down, but she
wobbles. Stevie reaches out for her at the same time she catches herself on
the boards.
It'd be almost comical if it wasn't worrisome.
“You've never been on skates, huh?”
Macie is instantly defensive, crossing her arms over her chest and
tipping her chin up. “I have too.”
“Yeah? Because your mom says you haven't.”
“Mom!” Macie yells, her jaw dropping. “I've gone rollerblading!”
“Trust me, kid, it's similar, but it's not the same thing. The ice is
slippery.”
“Well, duh.” Macie's eyes roll right into the back of her head. “I know
that.”
“Hey, I've been around this game my entire life, and sometimes players
still seem to forget it's a game played on ice while wearing really, really
sharp shoes.”
“I won't forget, gosh.”
“Hmm. I'm sure you won't.”
I cross my arms over my chest, then look over her outfit. It's a little
much with the huge puffer jacket, but I'll let her be the judge of if she
should wear it or not.
I take a closer look at her skates, then drop to one knee.
“What are you doing?”
“Fixing your skates.” I pat my leg. “Up here.”
“But…they're sharp. You just said so.”
“Just trust me, will ya, kid?”
She huffs but does what I ask and gingerly places her foot on my thigh.
I grab it, tugging her closer to me.
“I'm wearing protective gear under my pants. It helps to protect against
blades,” I explain as I adjust her skates. “It's something every hockey
player wears. It's a little weird at first, but you'll get used to it fast.”
I look up to make sure she's listening, and she nods several times. Her
eyes are wide, and she looks scared. Probably just nerves, I'm sure.
I glance at her mother, who is hovering over us, watching every little
interaction. She shoots me a small, equally shaky smile, and there's a punch
to my gut I'm not expecting when I see that. It almost feels like I don't like
that they're scared or nervous. I…I want to shield them from those feelings,
protect them. I want to—
Whoa. What the fuck?
I have no idea where that came from, but it's not me.
I give my head a small shake, then continue tightening the skates on
Macie's feet. When I'm finished, I set her back on her feet and rise. “How
do those feel?”
“Good. Better.” She looks at her mom, a small frown pulling at her lips.
“Sorry.”
Stevie smiles, her eyes crinkling in the corners as she gazes down at her
daughter. “Don't be sorry, silly. This is a learning experience for us both.”
She looks at me, her smile slipping the second our eyes meet. “For all three
of us.”
Make that my second not-so-veiled threat of the morning, and it's not
even ten.
“Right, Greer?”
“Does anyone call you your real name?” Macie asks before I can
answer her mother with something smartassy.
“My real name? Greer is my real name.”
“It's not your first name. Your first name is Jacob, full name Jacob Lee
Greer. You were born in Saskatoon, Canada. You started playing hockey
when you were five. You used to be a forward, but you ditched that when
you were my age. You—”
I hold my hand up, stopping her. “I'm pretty sure I know my own life
story from Wikipedia, but thank you.”
She rolls her lips together, a red hue creeping into her cheeks.
“Are you ready to get on the ice?”
Her eyes slide toward the rink, and there's a hitch to her breath as she
stares out at it. She's nervous.
I don't want her to be nervous. I need her to be the opposite of that if
this is going to be a successful day.
“Or you can sit on the bench like a big wimp instead.”
“Greer!” Stevie yells, stepping forward in front of her daughter, almost
like she's shielding the kid from me.
Macie, much to my delight, pushes past her mom and shoves her chin
up once again. “I'm ready to whoop your jackass.”
Stevie doesn't admonish her daughter for cursing. She's too busy
looking proud.
Frankly, I am too.
“Let's go.”
I take off, not waiting for Macie to keep up. It takes a few steps before
she finds her balance—each almost fall punctuated by Stevie's gasps—but
eventually she makes it to the edge.
“You ready?” I ask her once more.
She nods. “Let's do this.”
I hold my hand out, tugging her onto the ice without another word.
“Whoa! Ohmygodohmygodohmygod!” she yells as I tow her backward,
but her cries of fright quickly turn sweet as she yelps with laughter and her
face freezes into a smile.
I don't remember the last time I had to pull someone around the ice.
Maybe when I was sixteen with one of my pseudo-siblings? It's long
enough to have forgotten how fun it is to watch someone fall in love with
the same thing I love.
And that's exactly what I just witnessed. She loves it out here. This
ice…it's her home. She belongs on it.
“It's cold!” she calls out to me as I pull her along. “It feels good.”
“Yeah? You want to try it on your own?”
Her head bobs up and down frantically. “Please!”
“All right,” I say, slowing us down and skating closer to the wall. “I'm
going to let go slowly. If you get scared, I'm here. The wall is here too.
Right now, we'll just stand here so you can get your balance.”
“Okay,” she says, staring down at her feet.
“Don't look at your feet. Look at me. Looking at your feet is going to
make you even more nervous.”
“I'm not nervous.”
Those might be the words that leave her mouth, but the hitch in her
breath and her hands shaking in mine say the exact opposite.
“You know,” I tell her, “the first time I got on the ice, I was terrified. It's
slippery as hell, so who wouldn't be scared? But I rode along the wall, and
it took me a full thirty minutes to get around the rink. And it was a kiddy
rink, nothing big like this one.”
“How'd you get over it?” she asks, not even noticing that in the time
I've been talking, I've been slowly letting her hands go.
“Practice. I rode the wall for two whole days before I finally convinced
myself to just let go and try it on my own.” I step back, folding my arms
across my chest. “I guess you're already doing better than I did in that
aspect.”
It takes her almost ten seconds to realize I've let her go and she's
standing all on her own.
The second it hits her, she begins to wobble, and I ready myself to catch
her.
But the fall doesn't come. She's doing it.
“I'm doing it!” she shouts, echoing my thought. “Holy crap!” She
clamps her hand over her mouth, eyes wide. “Don't tell my mom I said
crap. She doesn't like that word.”
“But she lets you say ass?”
“No, she lets me say jackass. Totally different.”
I chuckle. “Right. My bad.” I glance down at her feet, trying not to
laugh at how she's standing, her toes tucked in and pointed toward one
another. “How are you feeling?”
“A little wobbly.”
“That's expected. But this”––I kick her feet out just slightly––“will help
with that.”
“Ohmygod stop! I'm going to—” Her words are cut off when she
realizes I'm right. She's much more stable now. “Wow. That is a lot better.”
“Yeah?” She nods. “Good. Now, let's try to move.”
“Move?!”
“Well, yeah. You have to move to play hockey.”
“Right, right. Let's move.”
I instruct her on how to move her feet for optimal skating; for the most
part, she does really well. There are a few moments where she's unsure and
scared, but she gets over them quickly. I teach her the proper way to fall,
then help her when she needs to get back up.
It takes about fifteen minutes before she's able to skate more than
twenty feet on her own, but she's doing it, and I was right—she was made
for the ice. This is exactly where she belongs.
“Do you love it?” I ask, skating slowly—at least it's slow for me—
beside her.
“So much. I want to do this forever.”
I can't help but smile at that. “I know the feeling.”
“Can we go faster?”
“Are you ready for that?”
She nods. “Yes.”
“Okay, but remember, I'm here if you start to feel like you're going
down. Brace yourself in the right way, and you'll be okay.”
“Got it.”
She picks up speed, striding faster and faster as the seconds go by.
I see it the moment it happens. She starts going too fast with too little
control.
Then, it happens.
And I hear the scream.

STEVIE
I've had some scary moments in my life, like when I got pregnant by a guy
I wasn't in love with and realized he would have to be in my life forever
now. Getting married to the same guy because it was “the right thing.” The
first time my ex had too much to drink. The other night in the bar when that
asshole cornered me.
But this moment right here? It's the worst of them all.
Macie's a crumpled pile of skin and bones, and I'm sitting on the
bleachers dumbfounded and unable to move.
The sound of Greer's skates against the ice is what snaps me out of my
haze and has me sprinting down the steps and onto the slippery surface. I
don't have the right footwear on, so I'm unsurprised when I land right on
my ass. Pain shoots through my backside, but I don't care. I need to get to
my daughter. It's the only thing that matters right now.
I crawl my way across the ice, my hands frozen and my knees likely
bruised. Greer has her cradled in his arms. He's speaking to her, but I can't
make it out.
All I see is a nod. She's moving.
Thank god she's moving.
“Macie! Macie! Macie!” I chant, reaching for her.
Her arms fly up, circling around my neck and hugging me tightly.
I grip her, holding her closer than I ever have before, rocking her back
and forth. “You're okay. You're fine.”
“Mom…” she says weakly, and for the first time since I saw her go
down, tears begin leaking from my eyes.
I try my hardest not to let out the sob that seems to be caught in my tight
chest. I don't want to scare her. I don't want her to know I've never been
more terrified in my entire life.
“Are you okay? Is anything broken?”
She shakes her head. “It hurts, but—”
“Where?” I pull her away, running my hands over her face and her head.
“Where does it hurt?”
I keep pressing all over her body, feeling for anything that could even
possibly be out of place.
“Just…sore. Everywhere,” she says, but I keep checking.
She's missing something. I'm missing something.
“I need to get to a doctor.”
“Stevie.” A heavy hand lands on my shoulder, and it takes me a second
to remember we're not alone.
Greer.
“Doctor,” I say to him.
“I can have the team doctor look at her, but she's okay.”
“I want to be sure.”
He tucks his lips together, likely stifling his need to tell me she's fine,
then nods. “Okay.” He shoves up from the ice, bends down, and picks
Macie up with zero strain.
“Hey!” she complains as he scoops her up in his arms.
“Quiet,” he argues back. “Your mom said so, and since you didn't bite
me today, I'm definitely more scared of her.”
“Why would I bite you?”
He doesn't answer her. Instead, he puts his hand out to me. “Come on.”
I slide my palm against his, letting him pull me up, which he does
effortlessly. Geez, how much does this guy work out?
No. Don't think about that now. Think about your daughter.
He takes short strides as we make our way across the rink.
“I can skate,” Macie protests.
“I'm sure you can,” Greer says.
“I want to have you checked out first,” I tell her.
She rolls her eyes.
Any other time, I'd chastise her, but not right now. Not when she looks
so small and frail in Greer's arms.
When we finally step off the ice, we head down a carpeted tunnel and
make a right. There are all kinds of equipment strewn about: helmets,
sticks, stacks of pucks. Photos and plaques line the walls as we make our
way down the hall, shouts coming from all directions and loud music
playing as we pass what looks like a gym. It definitely feels like a sports
atmosphere.
We turn into an office, and I'm surprised to see someone up on the table
in the middle of the room.
“Collin!”
He looks up from whatever the doctor is doing to his leg and grins. “Oh,
hey. What's going on?” He looks down at Macie in Greer's arms.
“Everything okay?”
He's asking Greer, not me.
“She's fine, but mom's worried.”
“I'm worried because she's my kid.”
“Oh, I'm aware. You are two peas in a damn pod,” Greer mutters,
shuffling said kid around.
“Learning to skate?” Collin asks Macie.
“Yes, and I'm fine.” She stretches the word out, completely annoyed
with me.
I get it. She could be okay…but she could also not be okay and just not
want to say anything. It's my duty as her mother to have her checked out,
even if it's against her will.
“Where can I set her, Doc?”
The doctor tucks his lips together, raises his brows, and nods toward the
other unoccupied table. “Over there is fine.” He looks at Collin. “I'll just be
a moment.”
Collin, who also looks like he's about two seconds away from laughing,
says, “It's fine. Take your time. I'm avoiding Harper right now anyway.”
“What for?” Greer asks as he sets Macie down. “I thought you two were
all stupid in love.”
“Oh, we are. Like stupid, stupid in love, but she wants me to model this
new design she's working on, and it's painful. How actors do it, getting all
covered in makeup, prosthetics, and whatever else for hours and hours…I
don't get it. I'd rather get slammed into the boards by Milan Lucic every
single day than sit through that shit.”
“Dude, Lucic is a beast.”
“Exactly my point,” Collin says.
The doctor stops in front of Macie, looking down at her. “Does it hurt
anywhere?”
“Just my ego.”
“Oh, you're definitely hockey player material with that one.” He laughs,
then points to her legs. “May I?”
She nods, and the doctor spends the next five minutes going over every
part of her body, checking for bumps, bruises, and anything else I can think
of.
“You didn't hit your head, right?”
“No.”
“You're lucky.” The doctor frowns over at Greer. “Though next time,
maybe wear a helmet?”
Greer pales, his hand going to his stomach like he's about to puke. It's
the same way I feel seeing my kid lying on the cold, sterile bed.
“Yeah. Next time,” he mutters.
“Next time?” It comes out a squeak, and even I hear the panic in my
own voice. All the eyes in the room are on me, including Macie's, whose
baby blues look about twice their normal size.
“Well.” The doctor claps his hands together. “Everything looks good to
me. You may be a little sore tomorrow—especially that ego—but
everything looks fine. Perfectly healthy.”
“Really?” I ask.
The doctor nods. “Really.”
I take my first real breath in minutes and let out a slow, steady exhale of
relief.
She's okay. She's going to be okay.
I look down at Macie, who is staring up at me with worried eyes.
“I told you so,” she says defiantly, though the bite her words usually
carry is missing.
“Yeah, you did,” I say quietly. I grab a strand of her hair, the same color
as mine, running it through my fingers while I let my heart calm down.
“You're okay.”
I'm not saying it to her; I'm saying it for me.
She's okay. She's going to be okay.
If I keep repeating it, then it's true.
“Can I go back out there now?”
My heart begins to hammer in my chest again, and I see her crumpled
on the ice all over. The panic that races through me is unlike anything else. I
hate it. I hate it so much I want to scream.
But before I can, Greer steps up.
“I think we should call it a day.”
“But—”
“Hey, life ain't all about you, kid. I have my own shit to take care of.”
I want to yell at him for cursing in front of my kid, but I don't have it in
me. I'm just too glad she's okay.
“Fine,” Macie mutters. Then she looks up at me. “Can we go, then?”
“Yes. And we're getting ice cream on the way home.”
“Okay.” I've never heard her be less enthused about ice cream before.
“I'm going to go put my shoes back on.”
I nod as she hops off the table. “I'll be right behind you.”
She walks out of the room and down the hall. I watch her until she
disappears around the corner toward the ice.
She won't go on it. I know her well enough to know she won't risk
getting in trouble like that.
“You good?”
I whirl back around to find Greer staring at me. Collin too. The doctor
isn't paying any attention.
“I'm fine,” I tell Greer.
He tips his head to the side, his lips twisted as he studies me. After what
feels like hours under his hot stare, he rights his head and nods.
“Okay.”
Then he brushes past me and out the door without another word.
“I think what he meant to say was he's sorry Macie got hurt,” Collin
says.
I let out a half-huff, half-laugh. “I'm sure that's not what he meant at
all.”
“For what it's worth, I'll talk to him.”
“Thank you, Collin. Really.” I shoot him a smile, then give the doctor a
wave.
I knew this whole thing with Greer was a mistake, and today really
proved me right.
Now I just have to figure out what I'm going to do next.
“So she's done?” Scout asks quietly.
I look out at my daughter, who is sitting at her favorite picnic table after
a long, grueling day at school. She has her nose back in that same hockey
book as before, only this time, she looks a lot less excited to be reading it.
“She's done.”
This morning as she sat on her favorite barstool eating her favorite
breakfast—waffles with peanut butter—she announced that she no longer
wants to play hockey.
It broke my heart all over again to see her shoulders drop and her chin
wobble when she said it. I asked her if she was sure, and she nodded. I
wasn't going to push the subject anymore, so I did what I do every
morning: I drove her to school with SportsCenter playing on the radio,
kissed her goodbye, and went to work.
She hasn't said a word since I picked her up.
“That's just…sad. She loves the game so much.”
“She's still going to watch,” I tell Scout. “But not play.”
Scout frowns. “It's not the same, I'm sure.”
“Probably not, but it's what she said she wants.”
“I still can't believe she fell.”
“Oh man, Scout. It was awful. I've never been so scared. I don't know
how you watch Miller play knowing it's your heart out there on the ice like
that.”
She shrugs, her favorite well-worn overalls slipping off her shoulders a
bit. She tugs them back up. “It's not always easy, but you have to remember
that they love the game. It's what makes them happy. It's what drives them.
They need it.”
“Yeah…” I cast one last look at Macie just as my phone buzzes in my
pocket.
I pull it out, and my lips shift into a frown when I see what's on the
screen.
King of Hell: Are you avoiding me?
“You okay?” Scout asks.
“It's Greer. He's worried I'm avoiding him because I haven't answered
him about Macie's next training session.”
“You haven't told him yet?”
I shake my head. “No. She just told me this morning that she doesn't
want to play again. I haven't had a chance to get in touch with him.”
“Still so weird to see you two getting along.”
“I wouldn't go that far,” I say.
“No? I mean, he's training your kid. That's getting along.”
“Was—he was training my kid. So now we have no reason to play
nice.”
Me: She doesn't want to play anymore.
King of Hell: Seriously?
Me: Yeah. Sorry to have wasted your time.
King of Hell: SERIOUSLY?!
Me: I'll still be your date if that's what you're worried about.
“I don't give a shit about the date.”
I jump, and my phone goes sailing out of my hand, landing on the floor
of the donut truck with a loud clamor.
“Well, I do, but I have other worries too.”
I pick up my phone, immediately annoyed that my worst fear has come
true—it's cracked.
“Great,” I mutter, pushing up to my feet, only to be met with Greer
standing just on the other side of the counter. “Were you texting me from
the parking lot?”
“Yes.”
“Why? That's creepy.”
“I wanted to know why you were avoiding me.”
“I'm not.”
He lifts his dark, heavy brows as if to say, Really? I call bullshit.
Yeah, I call bullshit too. I was totally avoiding him.
“Hey, Greer,” Scout says.
“Lady Miller,” he answers, and my sister giggles like a little schoolgirl.
It's annoying, but mostly because Greer is annoying.
“What do you want?” I ask the goalie, hoping whatever it is, I can get it
for him and make him leave faster.
“I'm not here for the food. I have a game tonight.”
“Then why are you here?”
“Because…” He looks over his shoulder at Macie, who is trying very
hard to pretend she's actually reading the book in her hands and not
listening to our conversation.
Note to self: My kid would make a terrible actress.
Greer leans in closer to the truck and quietly asks, “Why doesn't she
want to play again? Because of the fall?”
I nod. “I think so.”
“That's bullshit.”
“Greer!” I hiss at him. “She's ten. Leave her alone.”
“Well, I'm just saying. That's bullshit. I know she wants to play.”
“She's scared.”
He narrows his eyes, giving me that same annoying hard stare he gave
me yesterday, the one that made me squirm and want to be anywhere but
under his gaze.
“Can I talk to her?”
“Why?”
“Because.”
I sigh, not in the mood to deal with his crap. “Be my guest, but she's not
very talkative today.”
“Hmm.” It's all he says before he stalks away, going straight for the
table Macie's sitting at.
Watching him try to tuck his long legs in is almost comical, but the look
on his face is anything but. He seems serious, even more serious than Greer
usually is, and that's saying something.
“What's going on?” Scout asks, nodding toward them.
“He wanted to talk to her.”
“What for?”
I shrug. “Your guess is as good as mine.”
“They're both wearing the same frown. It's adorable,” Scout says.
She's right. They are both frowning, and they're taking turns shooting
quick glances this way. It's clear they're talking about me. Or us.
Whatever it is, it's quiet, and neither of them is giving away much of
anything. It's taking everything I have in me to stay rooted in the cute baby
blue truck and not march out there and demand to be part of the
conversation.
After what seems like hours, Greer finally pushes away from the table
and comes back up to the truck.
“It's you,” he says quietly.
“Excuse me?”
“The reason she doesn't want to play anymore—it's you.”
“What!”
“Shh!” Greer says. “Lower your voice.” He peeks back over his
shoulder to see if Macie is watching. Naturally, she is. He sends her a wave,
then glowers back at me. “Way to keep that casual and not suspicious at
all.”
“Hey, you were talking about me first.”
“Yeah, because your kid is afraid to confide in you because she doesn't
want you going all mom on her.”
“Going all mom?”
He shrugs. “That's what she called it.”
“That's…”
“Probably accurate,” Scout says, joining in on the conversation.
I whip my head her way. “What the hell does that mean?”
“Sorry.” My younger sister winces. “But it's true. I'm betting your
reaction to the fall was worse than Macie actually hitting the ice. She
probably doesn't want to scare you again. So even though she loves the
game, she's saying she doesn't want to play so she doesn't upset you.”
Greer points his finger at her. “Bingo.”
“What? That's just…”
My words trail off as I look out at my daughter. She's watching us, her
bottom lip tucked between her teeth, a look of worry etched across her face.
It's that same look she gave me in the doctor's office yesterday when he got
done checking her out. She wasn't scared because she fell. She was scared
because she thought she wasn't going to be able to play again.
“True,” I finish. “That's just true.”
Greer sighs. “You need to tell her it's okay to play.”
“But…how?”
“I'm not a mom, so I can't answer that for you. Look,” he says,
grabbing a pen from the cup on the counter, then a napkin. He scribbles
something down and shoves it my way. “I have to get to the arena, but take
this.”
“What is it?” I ask, picking up the napkin and looking at it. “A phone
number?”
“Yeah.” He nods. “Call that number. Ask for advice. She'll give it to
you.”
“Who is it?”
“Someone with a lot of experience going through what you are right
now.”
I stare down at the number he's scrawled. “Okay…”
“Call,” he instructs, his voice stern. He sends a wave to Scout. “Lady
Miller.”
My sister giggles again, but I don't even have it in me to be annoyed
this time. I'm too enamored with the mysterious phone number.
“Later, kid,” I hear Greer say to Macie as he walks past her.
She watches him cross the parking lot to his car, all the while a longing
gaze settling into her eyes. She wants to play hockey with him badly, and I
want her to be happy…and safe.
Macie sits there watching the lot, not moving until I tell her it's time to
go. She doesn't say anything on the car ride home or when we make it into
our apartment. She doesn't speak through dinner or even attempt to turn on
the game, which I know she knows is on because she's Macie, she loves
hockey, and she has the Comets schedule memorized.
When she goes to bed without asking what the score is, I know she's
truly bummed. I kiss her forehead, tuck her in for the night, and then make
my way to the kitchen, where I pour a glass of wine before stepping out
onto our small patio.
With a steadying breath, I punch in the number as best I can on my
shattered screen and put the phone up to my ear. It rings twice before
someone picks up.
“Hello?” A soft feminine voice comes over the line.
“Um…hi.” I let out a long breath. “This is going to sound weird, but
Greer gave me your number. See, my kid wants to learn to play hockey, and
he's agreed to train her. Yesterday, though, on her first day, she fell. I
freaked, and now my kid won't play. He said you may have some insight.”
The woman chuckles. “Well, all right, then. What's your name,
sweetheart?”
“Stevie.”
“Nicks?”
“The one and only.”
She laughs. “Look, Stevie, I've been in the same boat as you. I
remember the first time Jacob took a spill on the ice. I threw a huge fit and
made them stop practicing while I called an ambulance for him. He was
fine, of course, just a little bruised, but it scared the shit out of me. Us
moms never want to see our babies hurting, you know?” She sighs. “He told
me afterward that he never wanted to play hockey again. At first, I was
relieved. I loved the idea of my kid not getting hurt. But then I realized he
didn't want to play because I scared him, not the game. He loved it. He
belonged on that ice. It meant everything to him. My freak-out hurt him
worse than falling ever did.”
“What'd you do?”
“I took his scrawny little ass to the next practice and made him play.”
I laugh. “I can't imagine him being scrawny.”
Greer's so big now, easily topping six four. He's still lean, but if the way
his shirts cling to him is anything to go off, it's all muscle.
“Oh, trust me, sweetheart. He was. A mouthy little shit, too, though he
hasn't grown out of that yet.”
She lets out another breathy laugh, and for some reason, I can just
picture her sitting outside like me, but instead of a glass of wine in her
hand, it's a cigarette. She's an older version of Greer, all dark hair and
bright eyes, only instead of frowning at the entire world, she smiles
constantly.
The image makes me giggle.
“What's that for?” she asks, not missing it.
“Sorry. I was just thinking about your son.”
“Are you soft on him?”
“Excuse me?”
“My son. I assume you are if you're calling his mom.”
“Oh. Um, I'm his date for your wedding. Congratulations, by the way.
I'm really looking forward to it.” I sincerely hope she doesn't have that
weird I know when I'm being lied to thing moms seem to have.
“Aw, thanks, sugar. I'm sure my son isn't too happy to be attending yet
another wedding of mine.”
“That's not true. He's very excited.”
She lets out another raucous laugh. “You don't need to lie for him, but I
appreciate it. Makes me like you more. You said you have a daughter? I'm
surprised you're dating my son, then. He's not really fond of kids.”
I want to correct her and tell her I'm definitely not dating her son, but I
just let it go for now.
“He's great with Macie.” I take a sip of my wine to swallow down the
lie.
All right, so it's not a complete lie. They do seem to be getting along
better now than before. They have a weird relationship, but if it means she's
not calling him The Jackass every five minutes, I'll take it.
“Well, I'm glad. Maybe he's growing up some, settling down instead of
being so stubborn about love. Though I'm sure I'm to blame for that one.”
She chuckles, but there's no sweetness to it like there was before. Instead,
it's pure sadness. I want to reach through the phone and hug her. “Anyhoo,
enough about me. We're talking about you and your kiddo. Tell me what
happened.”
So I do. I describe the fall Macie took and how my heart climbed into
my throat and hasn't really left. How Macie is moping around, feeling
down, and how helpless I feel about everything.
When I'm done, the woman sighs. “Oh, Stevie, sweetheart. It'll all be
all right. I've been a hockey mom for a long time now. It's hard. I know
that, but we have to let our kids figure their stuff out, you know? If she
wants this—and it sounds like she does—you have to let her have it. She'll
be okay. Goalies wear lots of gear, you know.”
A weight that's been slowly settling onto my shoulders begins to lift as
her words sink in. She's right. I know she is.
“I have to let her do this.”
“You do, and I have full faith in you and her. If my son is willing to give
up his free time to help her, he must see something in her.”
I don't want to burst her bubble and tell her the only reason he agreed to
train Macie was that I would be his date, so I don't.
“Yeah, he must.”
“Well, listen, sweetheart, I'm going to get going. Us older ladies need
all the beauty sleep we can get, and I'm sure you still have lots to think
about tonight.”
“Thank you for taking the time to talk to me… Well, shoot. I never even
asked you your name.”
“It's Loretta.”
“Lynn?” I tease.
“The one and only.” She gives me another one of those laughs that I'm
really starting to love. “Good night, sweetheart.”
“Good night, Loretta.”
I hang up the phone, then set it on my belly, lifting my wineglass to my
lips and taking the final sip. I stare at the moon while I do exactly what
Loretta said I would—I worry. I mull over every word of our conversation,
then replay Macie falling.
It's going to be tough letting my only baby do something that almost
guarantees she's going to come home bruised or broken.
But…I know what I have to do.
Me: I want her to play.
Me: Call me tomorrow?
King of Hell: You got it.

GREER
“Are you sure this is going to work?”
I sigh. “That's the fifth time you've asked me that when I should be
asking you that. She's your kid.”
“Yeah, but you two have some sort of hockey bond or something.”
She has a point there. Sure, Macie is a ten-year-old with the attitude of a
sixteen-year-old, but on some level, I understand her. I'm not really sure
what that says about me, but I don't want to get into it now.
“If she sees you excited about it, she'll be game.”
“You think?”
I pinch the bridge of my nose, trying my best to swallow down another
sigh. “Yeah.”
We've been standing here for the last ten minutes, and this is the third
time we've had this same conversation. Stevie's nervous in a way I haven't
seen before.
But…I get it. After seeing Macie go down like she did, there was even a
part of me that didn't want her to play. I was surprised when we were
standing in Doc's office and that feeling hit me. I never wanted to see that
kid in that situation again.
And I don't mean any kid—I meant her. I didn't want Macie hurt. I
really, really didn't.
I felt awful seeing her fall, but I looked at it as a hockey player. It was a
soft tumble compared to some I've seen, so I wasn't too worried. But seeing
her afterward lying in that bed with Stevie looking like she was about to
throw up? I fucking hated it.
So, I left. I walked away.
Only I couldn't stop thinking about it. I needed to be sure she was okay,
just like I needed to make sure she wasn't going to give up on the game
over one bad fall. It was too clear how much she loves being on the ice for
me to let that happen.
I'm glad I went to see Stevie, and I'm really damn glad I gave her my
mom's number. Whatever she said to her worked because here we are,
ready to pick up Macie from school and take her for her second training
session.
“Your car is so extra.”
I glare over at Stevie, who is glaring at my vehicle. “Be nice to my car,
dammit.”
“Or what? You'll frown at me some more?”
“Yes.”
She rolls her eyes, but not before I see her lips tip up at the corners.
She's such a brat. I can't remember the last time I've been so annoyed
by someone yet still couldn't stay away. It's disconcerting, and if I never
feel this way again, it will still be too soon.
“How much longer?” I ask, checking the time on my entirely too
expensive watch.
I don't spend my money on much because I know this career isn't going
to last forever, but after signing my extension contract with the Comets, the
watch and the car were both gifts to myself.
“About five min—”
Her words are cut off by a yawn, and I glower at her.
“Stop that.”
“What?” She shrugs. “If someone hadn't woken me up with a phone
call at five in the morning, maybe I wouldn't be yawning.”
“How's it feel getting woken up?”
“You could have ignored my text, you know.”
“Right.” I snort. “Like you'd have let me.”
“True.” She grins, and it's an evil grin. “Are you sure she's going to—”
“Stevie, I swear,” I say, shoving off my car with a huff, “if you ask me
one more time if she's going to go along with this, I'm going to––”
She flinches.
Stevie fucking flinches, and it's enough to have me stumbling back,
completely caught off guard by it. When it sinks in why she flinched, so
does the anger. I'm pissed, so fucking mad I can't see straight. Not at her,
though—I'm upset at what that flinch just implied.
“What was that?”
“What?”
“Why the hell…” I gnash my teeth together, chomping away the words
that so desperately want to fly out of my mouth. “Why'd you flinch?
Did…” I swallow. “Did someone hit you?”
She shakes her head. “It was nothing.”
I seethe at her nonchalance, at her eagerness to brush it aside.
“That's not nothing, Stevie. Who did that to you?”
She raises her chin, meeting my heated stare. “It's none of your
business, Greer.”
It might not be any of my business, but I want it to be.
“Who.”
Not a question. A demand.
“My ex. He would grab me…leave bruises. Pin me against the wall and
yell in my face. But hitting me… It was only once.” She rushes the words
out quickly, like it only happening once somehow makes it okay.
“Once is enough for me to kill the man,” I say, brushing past her.
I have no clue where I'm going, no clue what I'm doing. I just know I
need to do something. Why I feel so fucking protective over her and her kid
is beyond me, but I'm just so damn mad right now. I––
“Jacob.”
It's the first time she's said my name, and I stop in my tracks when it
tumbles off her lips.
I don't go by it. I never have, not even when I was younger. The
moment I knew I wanted to be a hockey player, I insisted I be called Greer.
My mother is the only person to call me Jacob.
I turn back to Stevie. She's staring at me with trepidation in her eyes.
“Where are you going?” she asks quietly.
“To commit murder.”
She lets out a soft laugh. “Stop. Please.” She waves me back to her, and
I reluctantly trudge to her side, taking a spot beside her. “You don't even
know his name.”
“I would have found out.”
She grins. “I don't doubt that.”
We sit there in silence for a moment. It's uncomfortable in a way that
only having this conversation can be uncomfortable.
I hate this for her. I hate this for Macie.
Oh shit… “Macie…”
“Never,” Stevie answers my unasked question. “Never.”
Thank fuck. I drop my head into my hands, scrubbing my face, trying to
rid myself of the knowledge I never wanted to know.
I run a restless hand through my hair, then say, “I wasn't…I wasn't mad
at you, and I wasn't coming at you. I'm sorry if that…”
“I know,” she says, but I'm not sure she does.
If she knew, she would know that one time I caught my mother's second
husband wrapping his hand around her throat, and I came unglued. I broke
my hand fighting the asshole and had to miss a lot of good fucking hockey,
but it was worth it, and I'd do it all over again.
“Never,” I promise her.
“I believe you. Just…I spook easily sometimes. You seemed irritated,
and you did that thing he always did when he was irritated.” She mimics me
pinching my nose. “It was kind of his tell. And then you had your fists
clenched. Like that.” She nods toward my fists.
And yep, they are clenched, but this time, it's because I'm pissed as
fuck at the guy who dared to lay a hand on her. He needs to be dead, just
like any other fucker out there who dares to touch a woman.
I shove off my car again, this time letting my hands fall to my sides in a
relaxed position. Stevie doesn't flinch, and I'm grateful for it.
I stand in front of her, tucking my hand under her chin and lifting it up.
I'm not surprised to see her blue gaze shining, but it doesn't mean I like it.
“I'm sorry.” I don't take my eyes off her. “Thank you. For telling me, I
mean.”
She nods. “Thank you…for listening.”
“What was that?” I cup my hand around my ear. “Not sure I heard you.”
“Ugh.” Stevie tosses her head back with a groan, shoving playfully at
my chest. “You're the worst.”
“No, that's not what you said. It was something else. Sounded like two
words.”
“Fu—”
I clamp my hand over her mouth before she can finish her sentence.
“Careful,” I warn. “We're on school property, you know.”
She glares at me, and I can feel her frown beneath my palm.
“Now, I'm going to remove my hand, and you're going to say two
words I am very much owed, got it?”
She lifts her blue eyes skyward but nods.
“Good girl.”
It's subtle, but there's a spark in her eyes when I say it.
Interesting.
I store that information away—for what, I don't know—then slowly
remove my hand from her mouth. When she's no longer silenced, I stare at
her, waiting for her to say something…anything. I don't know how much
time passes before I finally see her mouth move.
“Thank you.”
It's quiet, barely audible, but it's still somehow the sweetest thing I've
ever heard.
“You're welcome.”
Just as the words leave my lips, the bell rings. Five seconds later, kids
begin filing out of the building.
I step away from Stevie, trying hard to ignore how much I miss her heat
the second I do. I resume my spot next to her against my car, then wait.
Several kids stop and stare at us—mostly my car. A few gawk at me in
awe, probably recognizing me from their televisions.
One yells out a “HOLY CRAP!” then promptly gets in trouble for
saying crap.
Moms do double takes and giggle. Dads look jealous.
Eventually I hear, “Mom? Greer?” Macie's pace slows, her mouth open
at the sight of us. “What are you doing here? Whose car is that?”
“It's mine. Want to drive it?”
“Heck yes I do!”
“Greer!” Stevie reprimands me, and I hate my last name for the first
time in a long time. “She's ten.”
“Oh shit. Right.”
“You can't say shit,” Macie points out.
“Right. My bad.”
The kid grins, her bright green and navy blue braces on display. I'm
pleased to see they are still Comets colors.
“What are you doing here?” she asks, looking around at the kids who
are all staring at her. Off to our right, a group of boys around Macie's age
are whispering behind their hands. I wish I knew which little shit got into
the shoving match with her so I could pummel him, but then I remind
myself they're kids and that likely wouldn't go over well.
“Hockey,” I tell her.
“Huh?”
“You have practice.”
Elation steals over her face, but it's gone just as quickly as it came when
she slides her eyes to her mother.
“I, uh, can't.”
Stevie steps forward. “Yes, you can. I want you to play.”
Macie's jaw drops again, her head tipping to the side. “I…I can? You
do?”
Her mom nods. “Yes, I do. And we better hurry if we're going to get
practice and ice cream in before bed.”
“What? Are you kidding? I'M PLAYING HOCKEY!” She throws her
hands into the air, spinning around in circles, her little backpack twirling
right along with her.
She abruptly stops, then marches right up to the group of boys and says,
“Suck it!” She darts to the car, but not before sticking her tongue out at
them.
They glare at her, but the second they catch me shooting even sharper
daggers their way, they stand up straight and run off.
Good. Little pricks.
“Come on,” I tell Macie. “You can ride shotgun. Your mom will follow
us.”
“I get to ride in the fun car, not the minivan?”
“It's not a minivan—it's an SUV!”
“Same lame thing, Mom,” Macie grumbles, pulling her door open.
“Yeah,” I say to Stevie as I push off the car. “Same lame thing, Mom.”
She looks like she wants to hurl some not-so-nice words at me right
now, but when she takes a peek around and sees we're still being watched
by just about everyone, she refrains.
“See you at the rink. And, Greer?”
“Hmm?” I ask her as I pop open my own door.
“Drive safe. You have precious cargo in that car.”
“Yeah, I know. I got my gear in the back.”
“Greer! I—”
But I don't hear the rest. I climb in and fire up the engine, giving it a
few good revs to drown out her yelling.
I look over at Macie, all buckled up and smiling brightly.
“Five bucks says we beat her there.”
Her smile widens. “You're on.”
“Again!”
Macie drops to her knees, then maneuvers herself back to her feet.
“Again!”
She does it once more.
“Again!”
“Ugh! Seriously?” Her hands go to her hips, and she purses her lips like
she just ate something sour.
“Yes, seriously.” I tap her helmet. “How do the new skates feel?”
“Good.”
“Better than those other ones?”
She nods several times. “Much better. Thank you again.”
“Yeah, yeah,” I say, brushing her off before she can latch on to my legs
in a hug like she did earlier. “Again.”
She groans but drops to her knees, then pushes up on her skates. She
looks absolutely ridiculous in the goalie gear that's practically swallowing
her, but she's catching on quickly.
We run through it twice more before moving on to the same thing, but
this time holding her stick. She struggles a bit during the fourth one but
pushes through it. We take a water break when we hit five, and she skates
over to the bench with ease, like it's not just her fourth time on the ice.
We've been skating together for a week now, and we do the same things at
every practice: up-and-down drills, holding-the-stick drills, and skating. All
the while, Stevie sits on the bench and reads or works on her laptop.
“Oh my gosh,” she mutters, tipping her green squirt bottle back and
squeezing water into her mouth. She misses, splashing herself in the face
and letting out a loud yelp when it hits her eyes instead of her tongue, but
she quickly recovers as if nothing happened and takes a drink.
I tried to warn her that she wasn't ready for the real goalie bottle, but
she wouldn't listen. She was insistent on having her own squirt bottle.
After she takes a few long pulls of water, she hits the ice again, skating
around in slow circles, still getting a feel for the surface. I was right about
her—she's got fire. She's smart, pays attention, and is not afraid to ask
questions. When she's struggling, she pushes through. When she's doing
well, she pushes herself to do even better. She has all that hockey grit that
makes a great player, and she's only ten. I'm betting she'll have a long
career playing if she's willing to put the work in.
“How's she doing?” Stevie steps up beside me just as I squirt water into
my mouth.
“Good,” I say, dragging the back of my hand across my lips. “She's a
natural, but even naturals have to work at their skills.”
Stevie's face lights up. “Yeah?”
I nod. “Yeah.”
“Good.” She shimmies her shoulders with happiness. “Honestly, she's
been so in love with the game for the last few years I was scared she was
going to build this experience up in her head, and it wasn't going to be what
she expected, and she'd hate it and lose interest. That's what I did when I
said I wanted to learn ballet. I quit after a year.”
“All that work, and you quit?”
“Well, yeah.” She shrugs. “We had some family stuff going on, so it was
rough.”
“Is everything okay now?”
Stevie lets out a sad sigh. “Yes and no. My dad passed away a few years
ago from cancer, so that part isn't good, but my other dad is finding a way
to move on, so I guess that's a good thing. He's healing. He's rediscovering
himself. It's…good.”
“I'm sorry about your dad. I've never lost a parent, so I can't imagine
how hard that is.”
“It's not fun, that's for sure. I was about to ask something dumb like Are
your parents still married? Then I remembered I'm your date to your
mother's wedding.”
“Fourth wedding,” I correct.
“Does that bother you? Loretta being married so many times?”
“Yes, but probably not in the way many people think it would bother
me. I'm bothered by it because it means she keeps giving away all the best
parts of herself to douchebags who don't deserve her. I want her to be
happy more than anything, but at what cost, you know? She's tried this so
many times. What's it going to take to make it stick?”
“The right person. Trust me when I say that's hard as hell to find.”
My jaw tightens at the mention of her failed marriage and the ex who
mistreated her. “I could still kill him, you know.”
Stevie grins up at me. “I appreciate that, but it's not necessary.”
“Does Macie know him?”
She shakes her head. “Nope. She was only two when we left. She asks
about him sometimes, but it's best that he's not in our lives. We think so,
and so does he. He hasn't even tried to reach out since our divorce, which I
am perfectly okay with. He didn't want Macie to begin with.”
My blood boils. How could he turn either of these girls away? I mean,
not that I'm mad about it given what I know about him, but still.
“He sounds like a prick.”
“He is.” She shakes her head like she's shaking away all thoughts of
him. “Anyway, what about your father? Is he remarried?”
I laugh. “Oh yeah.”
“Uh-oh. Stepmom troubles?”
“Nah. He only married one of them, then divorced her shortly after she
had her second child. The rest he's never married.”
“But he…”
“Had kids with them. I have six siblings.”
Stevie's eyes widen. “That's…”
“I know,” I tell her, understanding she's at a loss for words like a lot of
people are when I tell them. “For what it's worth, he's a really good dad.
Shitty husband for sure, but he's a present father.”
“Well, that's something, at least. How long was he married to your
mother?”
“That's the real kicker.” I grin. “They never got married.”
“Wait—they've both been married and have kids, but they never
married each other?”
“Nope. Mom went on to be a serial bride, and Dad became a serial
father. Match made in heaven if you ask me.” I shrug. “Oh well. At least it
gives me a better understanding of love. It's a—”
“Crock of shit?”
“Bingo.”
I wink at her, and she rolls her eyes.
“Don't be that guy, Greer.”
“What guy?”
“The guy who gives up on love before he ever has it because he's scared
he's going to get hurt.”
I scoff. “That's not what it is.”
It's not.
At least, I don't think that's it.
Shit. Is that my problem?
I shake my head. No, definitely not.
“How about we stop with the psychological analysis and get back to
hockey?”
“Oh goody, grumpy Greer is back.” Another roll of her eyes.
“I'm not grumpy. I'm focused.”
“Sure.” She pats my shoulder. “Whatever you need to tell yourself.”
She pulls her phone out of her pocket, and I see that the screen is
completely shattered. I'm surprised she can even do anything on it it's so
cracked.
“What happened?” I ask, nodding toward it.
“I dropped it in the truck last week.” Hmm. “How much longer is this
going to be?” she asks.
I try not to let my irritation at her line of questioning show. She's done
this every practice, trying to rush things along. “Do you want her to play
hockey or not?”
“I do, but I also want her to get her homework done and get to bed at a
decent time. I also need to feed her dinner, you know.”
“I'll buy dinner.”
Her mouth opens in surprise. “What?”
“Dinner—I'll buy it.”
I don't know why I say it. I haven't taken them to dinner before, but I'm
not ready to go home yet, either. I'm tired, yet also wired. I need the
distraction, or all I'm going to be doing is going over how I let that goal in
last night. It went right over my glove, and I never miss on my glove side,
especially not an easy shot like that.
“Greer, no,” Stevie argues.
“Well, it's too bad. I'm buying, so pick a place.” I point toward the ice.
“We're going to run a few more drills, and then we'll go.”
She calls after me, but I pretend I don't hear her, stepping onto the ice
and taking off in full stride to catch up with Macie. We go over a few more
things, practice her stopping and starting, and I show her how to hold her
stick properly.
“All right,” I tell her just after five. “I think we're good for the day.”
“Really? That's it?”
I laugh. “Yeah, that's it. But we'll go again in a few days.”
“A few days? I have to wait days?!”
“Well, not to skate, but to do other stuff, yeah.” I point a finger at my
chest. “Pro-hockey player, remember?”
“Someone likes to brag.” She skates past me in a huff. “Mom! I'm
hungry!”
“Well, good. We're going out tonight.”
“Really? Where?!”
Stevie bounces on her heels gleefully. “It's a surprise.”
Why do I not like the sound of that?

STEVIE
If you had told me a few weeks ago that I'd be sitting down to have dinner
with the goalie of the Carolina Comets, I would have laughed for multiple
reasons.
One, there's no way I'd be hanging out with hockey players. That's my
sister's thing, not mine.
Two, if I were with a player, it certainly wouldn't be the one who drives
me basically insane.
But here we are.
“You know, when I said you could pick the place, I meant you could
pick anywhere.”
“I know. And I did pick.”
“Yeah, but…” Greer curls his lips in disgust. “This?”
I shrug. “It's Macie's favorite, and quit acting like you're better than
everyone else.”
“I am better than everyone else, and that kid needs a better palate.”
“Hey! My palate is just fine!” said kid argues.
“Do you even know what that means?” Greer asks her, brows raised.
“Duh. Of course I do.” She huffs but doesn't elaborate. Instead, she
shoves past him to the counter and lifts her head up high. “Hi. I want the
McNuggets Happy Meal, please. Fries, barbeque sauce, and a big Coke for
the drink.”
I step in at that. “Make that a Sprite, please.” The last thing she needs is
to be all jacked up on caffeine.
“You get your own drinks.” The kid presses a few buttons on the screen,
never looking up. “What else?”
“I'll have a ten-piece McNuggets, small fry, water, and a chocolate
shake,” I tell him.
“Any dipping sauce?”
“Hmm. I'll do buffalo.”
“Sure. Anything else?” the worker asks, finally looking up and directly
at Greer. His eyes narrow for only a moment before he looks away.
Greer tugs his Comets hat down lower, then steps up to the counter. “I'll
have two Big Macs with extra sauce, a ten-piece McNuggets, a large fry,
and a Diet Coke.”
“Any dipping sauce?” the kid asks in the same monotone voice he's
been using.
“Ketchup.”
“Ew!” Macie and I say at the same time.
Greer sends us a glare. “I didn't judge your order. Mind your business.”
He turns back to the kid. “Add an apple pie to that, too, will ya?”
“Sure. Your total is…”
He rattles off our final bill, and Greer taps his card on the screen with a
sigh as Macie and I grab our cups. We make our way to the soda fountain,
and I have to stop Macie when she tries to go for the Coke. She frowns
when I make her dump it out and refill it with Sprite.
I fill my water cup, then take a drink. I can feel Greer's eyes on me.
“Yes?” I ask when I find him staring at me in disbelief.
“Did you really just put water in your water cup?”
“Um, yeah?”
He shakes his head. “You're such a rule follower.”
“It's a water cup. That's what it's for—water.”
“Yeah, but nobody actually puts water in there. The people at the
counter don't even expect you to put water in there.”
I shrug. “I wanted water.”
“Something making you extra thirsty this afternoon?” He bounces his
brows up and down.
I roll my eyes at the implication that I could ever thirst after him. “No,
but now that you mention it, my stomach is sort of upset.”
“What's wrong, Mom?” Macie asks, completely oblivious to the second
conversation Greer and I are having right now.
Us adults share a secret smile as we make our way to the back of the
fast-food joint and find a seat.
I don't miss the way people shift to look at Greer. I'm sure even if he
weren't an NHL player, he'd turn heads just on his height and build alone.
I'm sure being panty-dropping hot doesn't hurt, either.
We file into the booth, Macie choosing to sit by Greer instead of me,
then we wait. They wait for their food while I wait for the awkwardness to
settle in.
Except it never comes. I don't feel weird sitting here with Greer and
Macie. It feels…normal.
I watch as they talk animatedly about the upcoming game against St.
Louis. Macie tells him he needs to keep his eyes on a certain player, and
Greer laughs.
“Oh, don't worry. He's never scored against me.”
Macie's jaw drops. “Ever?”
“Nope. I know him too well.”
“How?”
“He's my brother.”
“SHUT UP!”
“Macie! Don't tell people to shut up.”
“Sorry, Mom.” She sinks into her seat. “Sorry. But…” She looks up at
Greer. “Are you for real?”
“Yep. He's about six years younger than me.”
“That's so cool. What's it like having a sibling? I want one someday.”
My head jerks back because this is the first time Macie has ever said
anything about wanting a sibling.
“It's fine. We didn't grow up in the same house, but we're still really
good friends.”
“That's so cool,” Macie says.
“It is really cool,” Greer agrees. “He's a good player.”
“Did you see his goal against Tampa? It was insane! Bet you couldn't
have blocked that.”
They argue back and forth about whether or not Greer could have
stopped the puck from crossing the line, but all I can think about is what
Macie said.
Do I want another kid? I'd be lying if I said I hadn't thought about it. I
bet it'd be amazing to see Macie in the role of older sister. I know I had a
fun time being one.
But then I start thinking about how much of an age gap it would be
between Macie and them. How, in just eight years, Macie will be off at
college, and I'll have free time again. Do I want to have another kid and
give that up again?
Maybe if I found the right guy and the timing was right, but I'm sure
with the poor state of my love life currently, it will be years before that ever
happens.
“Order number 12.” Two people appear at the end of the table holding
trays, and we make room for them to set everything down. They both
disappear without another word, and I divvy up the food. Macie dives right
into her nuggets, tearing open her barbeque sauce and plunging one after
another in.
“Slow down, Mace,” I tell her.
She holds her hand over her mouth, nodding her head. “Okay.”
She chews a little slower, and I feel less concerned that she's going to
choke, turning my attention to my food. I carefully lay out each nugget,
then open my sauce cup and pour some onto each chunk of meat. I grab a
few fries and pop them into my mouth. That's when I notice Greer staring at
me.
“What?” I ask after I swallow.
“What the hell is that?” He nods toward my tray.
“My dinner?”
“Yeah, I can see that, but why did you dump the sauce on the nuggets?”
“It's weird, isn't it?” Macie says, still shoveling fries into her mouth.
“She always does that.”
“Mind your own business, Macie.” Then I look at Greer. “You too. Isn't
that what you said earlier? No judging.”
“That deserves judging.”
“Agreed.”
I pick up a fry and toss it at my kid for that.
“Hey!” she yells before grabbing the fry and popping it into her mouth.
Greer shakes his head when I lift a sauce-covered nugget and take a
bite. “Shameful.”
“What? I want even sauce distribution. It's not weird. It's…it's…
science!”
“Pretty sure that's a bunch of bull—”
I narrow my eyes, cutting off his almost curse.
“Doo-doo. That's bull doo-doo.”
“Haha. Doo-doo.” Macie giggles like a maniac, which makes Greer
laugh too.
It's my turn to shake my head at them.
And he had the balls to call Macie and me two peas in a pod. Those two
have more in common than he thinks.
I wish I could say we eat our dinner without any more fry-throwing
incidents, but that would be a lie. Greer lobs a handful at Macie when she
steals one of his nuggets because she “can't bear the thought of the nugget
going through ketchup abuse.”
Greer empties our trays in the trash can while we don our coats.
“You girls ready?” he asks, shrugging his own jacket on and tugging his
hat down lower.
Only it's fruitless.
“Um, hey, mister?” a small voice says.
We all look down to find a kid who probably isn't older than six holding
a pen and a piece of paper that looks like a receipt. I glance over to see a
smiling young couple watching their son stare up at Greer with wonder.
They both look a little starstruck too.
Greer doesn't hesitate to drop down to his haunches, the widest and
brightest grin I've ever seen from him stretching across his face.
“Hey, little man. How are you?”
“Are you…” The little boy swallows, the slip of paper shaking in his
grasp. “Are you Mr. Greer? The goalie?”
“I sure am, buddy. What's your name?”
“Jonathan.”
“No way! That's my dad's name.”
“Really?” The boy's eyes light up. “That's so cool.”
“It really is.” Greer nods at the paper that's now crinkled in this kid's
clutch. “Do you want me to sign that for you?”
Jonathan nods. “Please.”
“How about I do you one better, huh?” He pulls the hat off his head and
reaches into his coat pocket, producing a silver marker. “You can have this
hat.”
“Wow!”
The kid—right along with me—watches in wonder as Greer scribbles
his name and the number 29 on the bill, and my heart melts when he places
the cap on the kid's tiny head. It's so big it immediately falls over his eyes,
causing him to laugh.
“What do you say, Jonathan?” his mother prompts.
“Thank you, thank you, thank you!” He throws his arms around Greer's
neck, and it takes the grumpy goalie a minute to realize what's happened,
but he squeezes the boy back, patting him gently on the head.
“No problem.” Greer pulls back. “Just make sure when you're watching
our game tomorrow night, you're cheering for us. Got it?”
Jonathan nods. “Yes, sir!”
He runs away to his parents, who both give thanks to Greer as he stands,
and he waves them off, muttering a No problem before turning back to
Macie and me.
“Ready, ladies?”
He says it so casually like he didn't just give this kid a moment he's
going to remember forever in the middle of a McDonald's.
“We're ready,” I say, ushering Macie ahead of us but not able to take my
eyes off Greer.
“What?” he asks, eyes falling to slits.
“Nothing,” I murmur.
But it wasn't nothing. It was definitely something, and I felt it
somewhere I would never have expected, especially not when it comes to
Greer.
My heart.
“It's so uncool that we had to ride in the lame-mobile when we have a
perfectly awesome car we could have taken.”
“I think one ride in the death machine is enough for now,” I say to
Macie, making eye contact with her in the rearview mirror.
She mutters something, but I don't catch it, which is probably a good
thing for her.
“You know, I could have brought my orange Viper ACR instead. Now
that's a death machine.”
“You have not one, but two sports cars?”
“Three.”
“Three?!” My eyes bulge at this news, and then I shake my head.
“Freaking rich people, man.”
Here I am, barely chugging along in the same car I was driving in high
school, and he has three cars.
He laughs. “Hey, I work hard for my money, you know.”
“You play a game.”
“A game where I work hard. Do you have any idea how many players
play with bruises and broken bones?”
“They do that?”
“Of course they do. Ask Miller about the time he scored twice on
Pittsburgh and then had his shoulder reset after the game because it had
been popped out since the second period.”
I slide my eyes toward him. “No way.”
He nods. “Yes way.”
“It's true, Mom. They all do it. They even put out a list of injuries at the
end of the playoff runs. It's wild.” Macie sits forward, gripping my seat and
Greer's. “But don't worry, that won't happen to me. I won't be hurt—I'm a
goalie.”
I'm not stupid enough to think that's true. I've seen enough games over
the last few years to witness the goalie get mowed over a few times. Heck, I
even saw once where one had to be helped off the ice on a stretcher. It's a
dangerous sport, and I still can't believe I'm letting her play it.
“Loretta told me about your first fall, you know.”
“Oh man.” Greer laughs. “She was so mad, made them stop the
practice. Did she tell you she tried to do it again during my first game when
someone bumped into me?”
“She didn't.”
“She's got fire, that woman.” The love in his voice is so clear. I want to
tease him for being a total momma's boy, but it's hard when he's so sincere
about her.
“She was really nice. Not sure what happened with you.”
“Hey! I'm nice. I just gave that kid my hat.”
I smile because he did just give that kid his hat, and it might have been
my favorite moment I've had with Greer in the two weeks we've been
spending time together.
“Nice isn't the word I'd use to describe you.”
He makes a noncommittal noise as we pull into the parking lot of the
Comets practice arena. I don't know how much Greer is paying for us to
use this space, and while I know I should ask to be prepared to pay him
back, I don't have it in me just yet.
I learned two nights ago that my time at the law firm is coming to a
quick close. They're going down to one secretary at the end of the month,
which means I need to find a new full-time job if Scout doesn't have use for
me at the donut truck.
I steer into a parking spot a few down from Greer's fancy sports car. I
have no clue what it is because I don't know a thing about cars, but it just
looks like it's fast.
“I could give you a ride in it, you know,” he says when he catches me
staring.
“What is it?”
“It's a ZR1.”
“Which is…”
“Corvette.”
“Ah. I thought it looked familiar. For years, my dad had a very outdated
car calendar in the garage.”
“Want a ride?” He raises his brows, and for a split second, I swear he's
not talking about a ride in the car.
I give myself a shake because there is no way he means that…right?
No. Another shake.
“Guess that's a no,” he says, pushing the car door open. “Later, kid.”
“Bye, Greer!” she says cheerfully.
He nods at me, then disappears, closing the door softly behind him.
I watch him go, watch the way his coat stretches across his broad
shoulders. The way he walks with authority like he's the boss and everyone
else knows it. The way he commands attention, even when nobody is
looking.
“Where are you going, Mom?”
“Huh?”
“Your door is open.”
I look down, and she's right—my door is open. What am I doing?
“I'll be right back.”
“Okay, but hurry. I want to watch some of the Minnesota game before
bed.”
I can only nod as I race from the car, chasing after Greer. He must hear
me because he spins on his heel, his brows raised in question when I skid to
a stop in front of him.
We're standing just a foot apart, staring at one another in the middle of a
dark, nearly empty lot.
“Stevie?” Greer finally asks. “What are you doing?”
What am I doing? I've gone nuts. That's the only explanation I have.
“Yes!” I blurt out.
“Yes?”
“A ride.”
His brows rise higher. “A ride?”
I nod. “Yes. A ride—in your car,” I add quickly. “I think I'd like that.”
A lazy grin pulls at his lips. “I think I'd like that too.”
“Yeah?” He nods. “Good.”
Because I've thrown all intelligent thoughts out the window, I push up
on my toes and press my lips to his stubbled cheek. I let them linger, let the
feel of the sharp prickles of his cheek brush against my lips and the way he
smells like something spicy and warm wash over me.
We both know the amount of time I spend with my lips on him is
inappropriate.
But we both let it happen anyway.
When I finally peel my lips away, I step back, only to find him staring
down at me with a look I've never seen from him before.
“Good night, Jacob.”
I swear I hear him mutter Evil woman as I walk back to the car.
“What are you smiling for?” Macie asks when I climb back inside.
“Nothing, baby. Nothing.”
It's a lie because it's definitely something. I'm just not sure what yet.

GREER & STEVIE
Stevie: Macie's not handling this well.
Greer: Me either.
Greer: Can't fucking believe we lost.
Stevie: I mean, the streak had to end at some point, right?
Greer: Yeah, but not like this. Not in a shootout against
Arizona.
Stevie: I'm sorry.
Greer: Yeah, me too.
Greer: Is she changing her braces colors?
Stevie: She's already on the phone.
Stevie: Kidding. She hasn't moved from her spot on the couch
since the horn went off.
Greer: If it makes her feel any better, I'm still sitting in the
locker room.
Greer: I'm not ready to leave and face the press.
Stevie: That has to be hard, talking to them after a loss.
Greer: It's the fucking worst.
Greer: Shit. I have to go. Coach is yelling at me to get on the
bus.
Greer: Tell Macie I'm sorry.
Stevie: I will.
Greer: Am I forgiven?
Stevie: After that win tonight? Yes, I believe so.
Stevie: She's already making plans to have the same
breakfast, lunch, and dinner and wear her jersey for the game
in two nights.
Stevie: Hockey players are so weirdly superstitious.
Greer: It's a curse we all bear.
Stevie: What's your weird superstition?
Greer: Peanut butter and banana toast.
Stevie: What?
Greer: I have to eat peanut butter and banana toast the
morning of a game.
Stevie: That's so…
Greer: Weird?
Stevie: Old. My grandpa used to eat that.
Stevie: You're an old man in a hot body, aren't you?
Greer: You think my body is hot?
Stevie: You know you're attractive. Don't play stupid.
Greer: True. But it is nice to hear once in a while.
Stevie: Please. As if women don't tell you that all the time.
Greer: They do, but I still like hearing it.
Stevie: Gag me.
Greer: Already getting kinky with me? All right. I can get into
that.
Stevie: Goodbye, Greer.
Greer: Wimp.
Stevie: Me?
Greer: Yes. You dip out just when the conversation gets good.
Stevie: I'm “dipping out” because I have a kid to take care of.
Greer: How convenient.
Stevie: *laughs in parent*
Greer: Tell the scrawny little shit I said she better be working
on her stamina like I told her.
Stevie: I already took her to the track today so she could run.
Greer: Did you run with her?
Stevie: Oh yeah. Did a quick ten miles. No biggie.
Greer: That's what I start my morning with.
Stevie: You're kidding.
Greer: I'm not.
Stevie: That may be the most disgusting thing you've said to
me yet.
Greer: What? Running is good for you!
Stevie: Yeah, and so is eating kale, but there is no way I'm
touching that.
Greer: I like kale…
Stevie: Of course you do.
Stevie: I really do have to go. I have to tuck Macie in.
Stevie: But don't tell her I told you that. She'd kill me if she
knew you know her mommy still tucks her in.
Greer: My lips are sealed.
Greer: Good night, Steve.
Stevie: Tell me about this wedding.
Greer: Well, when two people “love” each other, they get
married.
Stevie: Greer.
Greer: Steve.
Stevie: I meant, what am I supposed to wear?
Greer: I think they'd prefer clothes.
Greer: Well, most people would. There will probably be a few
old perverts who'd vote otherwise, though.
Stevie: I'm being serious!
Greer: Fine. I guess I also wouldn't mind seeing that.
Stevie: GREER
Greer: STEVE
Stevie: Help me. Please.
Greer: I have it taken care of.
Stevie: What the hell does that mean?
Greer: It means I have it taken care of.
Stevie: Yes. SO helpful.
Greer: I try to be.
Stevie: I was going to say something mean about you losing
tonight, but then I remembered I'd have to deal with my
daughter pouting, so GO TEAM.
Greer: Smart woman.
Stevie: Macie is bugging me about your next practice. Any
ideas?
Greer: We're flying back tonight after the game. I have shit to
do tomorrow, and we have the wedding Saturday. I have
practice Sunday, then a game on Monday. We leave for a
road trip on Tuesday, so…
Stevie: She's going to hate that non-answer, but I'll tell her.
Greer: Hey, being trained by an NHL player has its perks. It
also has its drawbacks.
Stevie: I know, I know. Macie is so grateful too. There's no
way I could ever afford training like this, so it really does mean
the world.
Greer: Don't get all weepy and emotional on me now.
Stevie: Weepy? Emotional? All I'm doing is thanking you!
Greer: And it's weird.
Greer: Go back to hating me.
Stevie: I wish I could.
Greer: What's that supposed to mean?
Greer: Steve?
Greer: Ugh. I take back the weepy and emotional thing.
Greer: STEVIE?
Greer: Maybe you fell asleep. Good night.

GREER
“What the hell are you doing here?”
I shove off my car, casually strolling toward the woman who is
currently shooting daggers my way while holding a giant white box that's
overflowing with stuff.
“Here, let me take that,” I say, grabbing it from her before she has a
chance to protest. My momma would be so proud of me in this moment,
being a gentleman. “What is all this?”
“I'm not answering that until you tell me what you're doing here first.”
She looks around the almost empty parking lot. “How'd you know I worked
here?”
I lift a shoulder. “I asked around.”
“So you got information from Miller again?”
I don't answer her because the last thing I'm trying to do is get Miller
into trouble for giving me information on Stevie, especially when he
doesn't know what I'm doing when I ask him about her. He's so oblivious
sometimes and gives up the information freely. It's comical.
“I thought you said you had stuff to do today,” Stevie says.
“I said I had shit to do today, and this is it.”
“You had to stalk me at work?” She crosses her arms over her chest,
glaring up at me. She seems irritated, even more so than usual.
“No. I'm here to give you that ride you requested.”
I don't miss the way her cheeks pinken at my words or the slight hitch
to her breath. She reaches up and brushes her long dark hair over her
shoulder.
“Oh,” she mutters, sighing softly. “Today feels like a bad day for that.”
“Why?” I jiggle her box, looking down into it to find a few picture
frames, some pencils and pencil holders, several stacks of papers, and…is
that a corded phone? I haven't seen one of those in years. “Does it have
anything to do with this?”
She lets out another long sigh. “Yes. I, uh, I lost my job.”
“Shit, Stevie. I'm sorry.” No wonder she's upset. She has Macie to take
care of, and this is a blow for her.
She waves her hand. “It's fine. I knew it was coming. Well, it was
supposed to come next week, but here I am, jobless today.”
“What happened?”
“They're merging firms, and they don't need two secretaries. I guess my
skills weren't up to snuff, and they chose someone else.”
Just then, the door behind her is shoved open, and a woman with short
red hair steps out wearing a skirt I'm pretty sure would show everything she
has to offer if she bent over. Her legs are long and toned, her bright yellow
heels drawing your eye just right. She's wearing a white blouse that shows
her bright red bra underneath. She almost looks like a sexy cartoon
character or something.
“Did you need any help with that, Ms. Thomas?” But she's not looking
at Stevie when she asks. Instead, her eyes are trained on me, that same
caught-you-staring grin I've seen time and time again pulling up one side of
her mouth.
The brunette in front of me huffs. “No, Becky, I'm good.”
“All right,” the redhead says, not once taking her eyes off me.
She doesn't make a move to go back inside, which irritates Stevie even
more. She doesn't have to say anything for me to know it; it's obvious in
her protective posture and the way her fists are now clenched at her sides.
Stevie's eyes begin to fill with tears, and I hate it. I hate it so fucking
much, more than I've ever hated anything before, and I've lost some wellfought games and been eliminated from the playoffs a few times. But this?
Seeing Stevie so upset? It's so much worse.
I drop her box, not caring about the items inside, vowing to replace
them if anything is broken.
“What are you—”
I kiss her.
I fucking kiss her.
It takes her a second to catch on to what's happening, but then she's
kissing me back.
Stevie is kissing me back.
Her lips are soft and pliable. She tastes like caramel candies and feels
like heaven pressed against me. I grip her waist, holding her to me, angling
my head so I can get a better taste. I run my tongue along the seam of her
lips, and she easily opens for me. I swallow the sigh that leaves her, tugging
her closer because I can't get enough for the life of me.
I want more. I need more.
A throat clears, and it's enough to snap Stevie out of the moment. She
shoves away from me, eyes now glassy with desire instead of tears. Her
chest heaves up and down, her dress a mess from my hands pulling at her.
Her lips are swollen, and her cheeks are stained red.
She looks fucking gorgeous, and it makes me want to kiss her all over
again.
“You can leave now, Ms. Thomas.”
Stevie tugs at her dress, righting the misaligned material, then grabs her
box and marches past me.
I look the other woman right in the eyes and wink.
Then I chase after Stevie. I jog past her, popping open the trunk of my
ZR1 and grabbing the box from her hands at the last moment. I try to catch
her eyes to get a feel for what she's thinking, but she won't look at me. She
just stares down at the ground as she turns and heads for the passenger door.
A soft gasp leaves her lips when she pulls it open.
“Greer…”
Finally, her summer sky blue eyes meet mine, and in that moment I'm
not sure I've seen a more beautiful sight.
“What did you do?”
I reach around her into the car, retrieving the white box.
“Yours broke.”
“I know, but—”
“No buts. Yours broke because of me, so I replaced it.” I shove the
iPhone box her way. “It's not the same model you had, but I think you'll
like this upgrade just fine.”
“Jacob…” she whispers, marveling at the device. “I can't accept this.
It's too much.”
“If you think that's too much, you're really going to hate the dress I sent
over to your apartment today.”
Her gaze snaps to mine, a bit of that fire she's so full of creeping back
into her eyes. “The what? What dress?”
“I was only kidding about you going naked to the wedding.” I lean
down until my lips brush against her ear. “Though I wasn't kidding about
me liking the idea of seeing you that way.”
When she pulls back, her cheeks are brighter than I've ever seen them.
“Come on.” I place a hand on her hip and nudge her toward the car.
“Get in. We have plans.”
“We do? Where are we going?”
“It's a surprise.”
“I hate surprises.”
I laugh. “You won't hate this one. Go. In.”
This time, she doesn't argue. She slides into the car, still staring at the
new phone in her hands. She doesn't look up until I've climbed into the seat
next to her.
“You like it?” I ask, firing up the engine.
“This is a month's rent for me, you know.”
“Is it?”
She nods. “Yes. I…” She slams her eyes closed and swallows thickly,
her fingers running along the edges of the box. When she peels them back
open, she looks over at me just as a single tear escapes down her cheek. It
takes everything in me not to lean over and brush it away.
“Thank you, Jacob,” she says quietly. “For everything.”
She doesn't just mean the phone or the dress or the lessons.
She means the bar too.
“You're welcome, Stevie. For everything.”
Another thick swallow. A nod.
She clears her throat, then looks down at the phone. “You might have to
help me set this up.”
“I think I can manage that. But first…fun.”
I rev the engine a few times, and she laughs.
It's the sweetest sound I've ever heard.
“You can't be serious.” Stevie stares out at the space before us. “I am not
properly dressed for this.”
“Hey, it's not my fault you wore a dress to work today.”
“You saw the competition I had. I had to try everything possible.”
I hate that she felt she needed to show some skin to save her job, but I
don't think she'd be up for a lecture on that right now, so I say, “I have
some extra stuff in my bag you can wear.”
“That's not going to fit me at all.”
“We can make it work.” I shuffle toward the duffle I tossed onto the
bench and unzip it, root around until I find something suitable, then hold it
up. “Here. This should work.”
She curls her lips at the clothes but accepts them anyway. “This is
ridiculous.”
“Sure, but it's going to be fun. I'll get to teach you and your kid how to
skate.”
“Except she was ready for this. I'm not.”
“You'll do fine.”
“You're not going to let me fall like you did her, are you?”
My heart drops into my stomach. “I didn't—”
“I'm kidding, Greer. I know it wasn't your fault.”
I'm annoyed I'm back to being called Greer, but I don't say anything.
“If it's any consolation, I don't think I've ever felt so bad in my life,
including when I went to the World Juniors and lost the gold medal in OT
and all of Canada was pissed at me.”
“Wow. What a comparison, my kid to your hockey game.”
“Hey! World Juniors is a big thing.”
“Yeah, and so is my kid.”
“Right.” I clear my throat. “I am sorry.”
“I know. I could see how upset you were. Not as upset as me,
obviously.”
“No. I think the only person topping you there was my mother when she
had her freak-out over me.”
“Be nice to your mother, Greer. She loves you.”
“Yeah, yeah—whoa! What are you doing?”
She stops moving, her dress halfway up her body, leaving her bottom
half in nothing but her underwear and red heels that I bet would look really
fucking good wrapped around my waist.
“Uh, changing?”
“Here?”
She shrugs. “There's nobody here. What? Have you never seen a
woman in her underwear before?” She gasps. “Oh my gosh, it was never
Miller—you were the virgin all along!”
I glower at her. “As if.”
“The '90s called—they want their Valley girl talk back.”
I send her another glare, trying my best to keep my eyes trained on her
face and not on her body as she peels the rest of the dress off. It's hard, and
so am I just watching her. She's fucking beautiful, even with her
mismatched baby blue bra and lacy black underwear.
“Laundry day?” I ask to distract myself.
“Nope. I'm just not fancy enough to match. Nor do I care—I'm not
trying to impress anyone.”
“Good.”
She pauses for a moment, eyes focused on me and the very possessivesounding word that just left my mouth. If she has something to say, she
keeps it to herself. She just toes off her heels, grabs the pair of pants from
the pile of clothes I gave her, and pulls them on.
I admit I'm sad when she slips the shirt over her head and lets it fall. It's
too long on her, but she's got that covered, pulling the hair tie from her
wrist and cinching the shirt to a wearable length.
I toss her a pair of socks, and she puts those on, then sits.
“Can you help?” she asks, batting her lashes and pointing to the skates.
It's subtle, but I hear the shift in her breath when I drop to my knees in
front of her. I don't even have a witty one-liner to tease her with since she's
clearly enjoying this. I'm too fucking busy trying to talk my dick down
because something in me loves this scene entirely too much.
Visions of a naked Stevie spreading her legs for my assault do nothing
helpful for the aching cock in my jeans, and I wish we were anywhere else
right now so I could bring them to fruition. What I wouldn't give to slide
my tongue along her pussy so I could hear her scream my name.
“Greer.”
I snap my head up.
“I think they're tight enough.”
I look down, and, yep, her skates are on and all tied up. She's ready to
go.
I shove up to my feet, adjusting my cock as discreetly as I can, then
plop down next to her and put on my own skates.
“You ready?” I ask once I'm all laced up.
“I guess.” She wobbles a bit as she pushes to her feet.
“You look ridiculous.” She does. But also seeing her in my clothes… I
like it entirely too much.
“A good ridiculous?”
“Of course.” I grab her hand to steady her, then lead her to the ice. “All
right. We'll go slow at first, okay? I'll keep hold of you just like I did
Macie.”
“Sounds good,” she says, walking onto the ice looking like Bambi,
bumbling all over the place.
“Your kid is a lot better at this than you.”
“Yeah, I guess so.” She stares down at her feet as I tug her along.
We skate like that for several minutes before I ask, “Think you're ready
to try it on your own?”
She nibbles on her bottom lip, looking up at me with wary eyes. “I think
so.”
“All right. Letting go in one…two…three.”
I release her, ready to reach out and catch her because I fully expect her
to go tumbling down.
But she doesn't. No, she takes off in a full stride, gliding across the ice
like a fucking pro.
“What the…”
I watch in awe as she skates with ease, shifting her feet perfectly,
skating backward, and even spinning in a circle. I stand there with my arms
crossed over my chest, glaring at her.
“You were playing me.”
She grins from across the way, her shoulder rising. “Maybe.”
“Where'd you learn to skate like this?”
“Lowell.”
I tip my head back. “Lowell, as in my captain Lowell?”
She nods, doing another twirl and adding a small jump this time. “Yep.
We went to high school together and often hung out at the skating rink.
We'd go after school and mess around.”
I pull to a stop, my fists balling up at my sides. “Mess around as in…”
She rolls her eyes. “As in skating around. Nothing sexual. We weren't
into each other like that. Well, except for that one time.”
She sticks her tongue out, skating backward even farther away from me.
I chase after her, determined to make her pay for her so-not-funny joke.
The thought of Stevie and Lowell together makes me furious. I know he's
madly in love with Hollis and there's no chance of anything happening, but
I hate the thought all the same.
I know I have no business hating it, which irritates me even more as I
hunt Stevie down.
I'm much faster than she is and could easily catch her, but I'm enjoying
our game of cat and mouse too much to let it end so soon. When I see she's
running out of steam, I pounce.
Well, not really, but I do ease her against the boards, boxing her in, and
she sucks in gulps of air.
“That wasn't a very funny joke.” I grip her waist in one hand as I help
to hold her steady.
“Aw, that's too bad. I was going to use it in my next standup routine.”
“You do standup? You'll have to let me know when and where. I'll
make sure to bring tomatoes.”
“Nobody throws tomatoes anymore, Greer.”
“Too bad. Some people could really use a good tomato to the head.”
She laughs and loses her balance, letting out a little squeal as she starts
to slip and reaches out for me, her hands curling around my biceps. It's a
familiar position—her pressed against me and nearly out of breath. It's the
same one we were in just an hour ago when I kissed her.
We haven't said a word about it, not even on the drive over to the rink.
She spent that time talking to Macie on the phone as Scout drove her to
Miller's place for a sleepover. I know she will be alone tonight, and that's
the kind of information that could get me in trouble.
So much trouble.
It's just the kind of trouble I want to be in…the kind of trouble I want to
be in with her. But if we're going to do this, I have to know we're on the
same page.
“Steve.”
“Greer,” she responds, not even having it in her to admonish me for
using her nickname. Her focus is entirely on my mouth, never wavering.
“I can't offer you love.”
My words pull her out of her haze, and her eyes slide to mine.
She swallows once. Twice.
“I don't believe in it,” I say.
“I know that,” she whispers.
“So, this…”
“It's fun,” she says.
“Fun?”
“Yeah. That's what we're supposed to be having, right?”
I hold her gaze with mine. If I look past the heat that's burning in her
eyes, I can see something else, something I'm not sure I'm quite ready to
see. There's a niggling feeling in the back of my mind that tells me
something is wrong, says something isn't right about this and I should walk
away. We had one kiss. It doesn't have to lead to more.
But I'm not sure I can walk away. Not now, not when I know what she
tastes like. Not when I know how perfectly she fits against me, like it was
always meant to be.
I can't walk away, even though I should because I know there's no way
I'm going to be able to give her what she's inevitably going to want.
It's stupid. It's dangerous.
Knowing all those things? It changes nothing.
I feel myself nod, and I hear myself say, “Yeah…fun.”
Her tongue pokes out to wet her lips. “Okay.”
“Okay.”
We stare at each other for several moments, and I'm not sure either of
us even blinks in that time. I want to be sure she understands what I'm
telling her. I can't love her. It's not who I am. This, what's happening
between us, it's purely physical. It's fun.
When she has no objections, when I don't see any second-guessing, I
ask, “Can I kiss you now?”
“Oh, are you asking now? Because earlier, you weren't a gentleman at
all. You just—”
I don't let her finish that sentence. I crash my lips to hers, stealing away
her smartass comment and her breath.
This time she doesn't hesitate to kiss me back. She gives me everything
she has in her as she throws her arms around my neck and tugs me closer.
It's still not enough.
I haul her up and into my arms, loving it when she hooks her legs
around my waist like it's right where they belong. It's a bad idea, holding
her and kissing her like this on the ice, but dammit, I'm a professional
hockey player who lives on the ice. I can handle this, especially for her.
She lets out a soft moan, pressing against me as I drop my hands to her
ass. It's just so I can get a better grip, I tell myself. It's a lie, though. I can't
resist touching her, can't deny how good she feels beneath my exploring
palms.
This moment…it's fucking magical. I can't imagine a place I'd rather
be, a person I'd rather be with.
Her. Her. Her.
It's all I want.
All I need.
I have no clue how long our tongues stroke together as we paw at one
another, but it's long enough for her to begin shivering in my arms. I miss
her touch the second I finally convince myself to pull away.
“How's that for being a gentleman?” I ask, setting her back down on her
legs.
She wobbles a bit—something I really fucking love—and grins up at
me. “You might be the most gentlemanly gentleman I know.”
“That so?”
She nods. “Th-That's so.”
I want to push her against the boards and kiss her again, but she's
shaking right in front of me, and I want to shield her from that even more.
“Come on.” I grab her and tug her back across the ice.
“Where are we going now?”
“My place.”
“Greer.” She tugs on my hand until I stop. “I can't just go home with
you.”
“Why not?”
“Um, because I have a kid.”
“She's with your sister for the weekend.”
I know because Miller was excited about the spa night he has planned
for all of them, which I mercilessly teased him about earlier.
“I know, but…” Her tongue darts out to wet her lips. “I can't. I'd like to
go home.”
If I said those words didn't hurt like a puck to the nuts, I'd be a liar.
“Okay. I can take you home.”
I turn back to keep going, but she tugs on me again.
“What?” I ask, turning back around, trying to mask the hurt I'm
definitely feeling but have no right to.
“Come with me.”
“What?”
“Home,” she says. “Come home with me.”

STEVIE
This last month of my life has been the most insane.
First, the night out at the bar with other moms—the same ones who still
haven't called to invite me out again. Then Greer showing up at the truck
and guilting me into a date. Him training Macie. Me losing my job. Greer
kissing me.
And now, he's in my apartment.
None of this was at all how I thought this month would pan out, but
here we are.
Here we are, stepping into my apartment, Greer's eyes taking in the
space around him. I'm sure it's not much to him, but it's home to Macie,
Scout, and me.
“This is nice,” he says, pulling his jacket off. “It's—”
“An absolute disaster? I know, but you'll have to excuse the mess. I
have a ten-year-old.”
Greer folds his jacket—one I'm sure cost as much as my rent—over his
arm and lifts his dark brows. “I was going to say cozy. It's cozy. A lot more
lived in than my apartment.”
“Lived in is a nice way to say messy.”
“No. It's a nice way to say my apartment is cold and unwelcoming. This
isn't.” His eyes move around the room, still surveying each part. “I don't
spend much time at my place, especially during the season, so it feels a
little bland. This one reminds me of my childhood home—lived in.”
“Does your mother still live there?”
“No. She lives here, actually.”
“Really?”
“Yep.” He nods. “I moved her here a few years ago after her third
divorce. She was in a rough place, and I figured a change might do her
some good. Now her business is thriving, and she's getting married. So
we're all happy, I guess.”
“Yes, you sound positively elated when you talk about your mother's
fourth marriage.” I roll my eyes so he knows I'm being a complete
smartass. I grab his coat, hanging it up on one of the empty hooks near the
door, then toeing off my heels. I look ridiculous right now, still wearing
Greer's clothes and my high heels, but I didn't feel like changing again after
skating.
He grunts. “Sorry. It's just…”
“You don't believe in love. I know.”
An arm curls around my waist, and I'm tugged back against him before
I even know what's happening. He spins me around, pressing my back
against the door and boxing me in. I'm out of breath as I stare up at him, my
chest heaving, nearly brushing against him because that's how close he is.
“Steve,” he whispers, his hand slipping down my side to my waist, his
fingers curling into my skin, branding me as his.
“Greer.” I grin despite my best efforts not to. I hate being called Steve,
but the way it sounds coming out of his mouth…well, it makes me hate it a
little less.
“Say my other name.”
“Huh?”
“My first name.” His grip on me tightens. “Say it.”
“Jacob.”
He inhales sharply, and a quick beat later, his mouth crashes against
mine. I have no clue who reaches for the other first, but it doesn't matter
now that we're fused together, pulling at each other like maniacs.
His hands slide under my shirt—or rather his shirt—and mine grip the
edges of the tee that hugs him like a second skin. He shivers when my
hands collide with his bare skin, and I nearly combust as the pad of his
thumb outlines the wire of my bra. His hands are somehow soft and rough
at the same time as he holds on to me like he's afraid I'm going to fade
away at any moment.
There's no way there's a single thing in this world that's better than
having his hands on me. It's not possible.
I'm not sure how long we make out like teens against the door, but it's
long enough for me to need more.
“Jacob.”
He pulls, taking one last nibble at my lips. “Yeah?”
“Can we—”
I can't even finish my sentence before he's dragging me through the tiny
apartment and to the couch. He plops down, pulling me onto his lap and
tugging me back down for another kiss.
I laugh at his urgency.
“Stop laughing,” he says, not finding it as funny as me.
“Well, I can't help it. You're practically mauling me, tossing me around
like a wild man or something.”
“That's because I can't get enough.” He sits forward, pressing his lips to
my throat. “It's been too long.”
“Since you last kissed me? Or since you last kissed anyone?”
He pulls back, his eyes narrowing. “Is that your way of asking me if I'm
seeing anyone?”
Crap. Is it?
I lift a shoulder. “I guess it kind of is.”
“No, Stevie. I'm not seeing anyone else. In fact, I haven't seen anyone
else for months.”
“Months?” I squeak out.
“Yes.”
“Years.”
“Years?”
I nod, looking down at my lap and where we're connected, not missing
how well we seem to fit together. “I haven't been with anyone in years. Not
since…”
He inhales sharply at this information. “Nobody?”
I shake my head. “Not even a kiss.”
“Fuck, Stevie. If I had known that…”
He leans forward, one hand gripping my waist, the other sliding into my
hair. His thumb caresses my cheek as he stares into my eyes like he never
has before.
“I would have kissed you like this.”
He presses his mouth to mine. It's a soft kiss, so much different than the
others we've had, languid and sweet. There's nothing rushed as he coaxes
my lips open and slips his tongue inside. It might be the gentlest side of
Greer I've experienced yet, and somehow it gets me just as hot as the
rougher version.
An involuntary whimper leaves me the moment he pulls away because I
already miss him. He doesn't miss it.
His chest rumbles with a laugh. “Better?”
“Just as good,” I tell him, because it's true.
“Hmm. Guess I'll have to do it again, then.”
And he does, only this time, his gentle touches don't last. They turn
quickly into the same rough, unfiltered, and impatient movements from
earlier as he pulls at me, needing more.
I need more too.
I break the kiss, reaching for the hem of my shirt and pulling the
material over my head. I let it fall to the floor somewhere behind me as I
reach behind me and unhook my bra. I sit on his lap in nothing but a pair of
pants that aren't even mine as I stare down at Greer and his hungry green
eyes.
Unlike earlier at the rink, he doesn't try to pretend he's not looking at
me. This time he is doing so completely unabashedly. He takes me in, eyes
tracking over every inch of me, from my eyes to my tits that aren't as perky
as they once were, the faint stretch marks on my belly from my pregnancy
and the loose skin I have there too. His eyes linger on the small scar from
my C-section, then he drags them back to my face and starts all over again.
I feel like I'm supposed to do something like cover myself or be shy or
embarrassed by my body, but I can't find it in me, not when he's looking at
me like I'm the most beautiful woman he's ever laid eyes on.
He wants me, and I want him too.
He reaches a single finger out, and I shiver when his fingertip connects
with my already hard nipple. He traces the puckered skin over and over, and
it's annoying because it feels so good and like not enough all at the same
time.
I squirm against him. “Greer, I—”
My complaints quickly transform into a gasp as his mouth closes around
the same nipple he was tormenting, and my eyes drift closed with pleasure.
The moment they close, I hear him. “Eyes on me, Stevie.”
His voice is rough and deep, and I want to obey his request so badly, but
it's hard. Having his mouth on me feels too good.
I peel them back open, watching him as he kisses both my breasts,
sucking and nipping at them only to swipe his tongue over the slight sting
he leaves behind. He does it over and over again until I swear I'm about to
come from this alone.
Then, without warning, he releases me.
“No!” I cry out, reaching for him.
He laughs darkly, grabbing my hands and halting my movements. “If
you keep squirming like you are, I'm going to blow my load in my jeans,
and that would be sad because I'd rather come down that pretty throat of
yours.”
My mouth waters at his words.
“Oh,” he says. “You like that idea, huh?”
I nod.
“On your knees, then.”
I scramble off his lap, dropping to the floor in front of him. He spreads
his legs, and I relish the sting in my knees as I scoot closer to him.
“Take my cock out,” he instructs.
I've never been happier to listen to someone than I am at this moment.
I reach for his belt, sliding the expensive leather through the buckle and
undoing the clasp. I unsnap the button, then drag the zipper of his jeans
down. He rises up just enough for me to tug his pants down while he pulls
his shirt off.
He sits before me, his pants half off, no shirt. He looks like a king on his
throne, and I'm happy to be his servant.
“Take it out,” he instructs again, his voice gruffer than before.
I oblige, reaching into the black underwear and pulling his swollen cock
free. I swallow thickly at the sight of him. He wraps his hand around
himself, stroking slowly. I couldn't look away even if I tried.
“You want to taste me, don't you?”
I nod, unable to take my eyes off him.
“Do it. Put me in your mouth.”
I don't waste another second, sliding my tongue against his shaft from
base to tip. A deep growl leaves his throat, and it's like music to my ears,
spurring me on. I close my mouth over the head of his cock, circling my
tongue on the underside, paying special attention to the frenulum.
He hums his pleasure as I swallow more of him, letting my untrained
mouth adjust to his size before taking more. He lets me go at my own pace,
but I know he's holding back. I know he needs more.
I need more too.
I grab his hand and bring it to my head, looking up at him. His eyes are
glassy and full of lust, but he understands what I want.
“Are you sure?” he asks. “Because I'm not so certain I can be gentle,
Stevie. In fact, I don't want to be gentle. Do you understand?”
I nod.
I feel it the moment he lets go. His fingers close around a fistful of hair,
and he ruts up into me, shoving his cock down my throat. I choke on the
intrusion, which spurs him on even more, and he thrusts into me again.
Tears spring to my eyes, a few spilling over nearly instantly. I can't breathe,
yet I've never felt so alive before.
I feel like I should hate this, being used like this, but I realize I just
don't care. It feels too good, too right having him in my mouth.
His grip on my head tightens, his other hand coming down to stroke
away the tears that are now streaming down my face as he continues
thrusting. I swallow around him, and he lets out a guttural sound.
“Fuuuuuuck,” he moans. “You take me so well, Stevie. I swear your
mouth was made for my cock.”
I nod because I swear it too.
He drives himself into my mouth over and over, his body growing
stiffer with each movement, his breathing getting sharper and sharper while
mine gets weaker and weaker.
“I have to come,” he mutters.
He tries to pull away, but I refuse, digging my nails into his thighs to
halt his movements.
I deserve this. I deserve all of him.
He thrusts into me twice more, and that's when I feel the hotness of his
cum hitting the back of my throat. I swallow everything he has to give me
as his strokes slow while he comes down from his high.
When he's fully spent, I let him slide out of my mouth, then rest my
head on his thigh, sucking in pulls of air for what feels like the first time in
hours as Greer strokes my head and attempts to steady his own breaths.
How is it I didn't even come, and I feel spent like I just ran a marathon?
Everything in my body aches, and I'm not sure I'll be able to move again.
“I should go.”
His words are like a bucket of ice water.
They're enough to have me lifting my head and peering up at him.
“Go?”
He nods. “Yeah. I have practice tomorrow morning.”
“Oh.”
It's a stupid thing to say. I know it is, but it's all I can muster. I just let
him fuck my mouth, and he has to go because he has practice in the
morning? I…
Well, I'm pissed.
And hurt.
And did I mention pissed?
I shove up to my feet, trying hard to ignore the sting in my knees when I
stretch them out. I'm sure I'll have bruises tomorrow. If you had asked me
about them just twenty seconds ago, I'd have said they were worth it, but
now, staring down at Greer as he tugs his jeans back up and buckles his
pants like nothing happened, I don't think that's the case at all.
I step back when he rises from the couch, crossing my arms over my
chest to cover my naked breasts because I'm still practically nude as he tugs
his shirt back on.
“Hey,” he says softly, his fingers sliding under my chin and pulling it up
to meet his eyes. “We good?”
I nod because right now, it's all I can do.
“Okay. I'll see you at four tomorrow.”
My brows crush together. “Four?”
“The wedding. I'm the dude of honor, so we need to get there early.”
“Oh. The wedding. Right.”
A frown pulls at his lips, but it's gone as quickly as it appeared. He
gently kisses my lips, then gives me a grin. “Good night, Steve.”
“Night,” I mutter.
Without a backward glance, he walks out of my apartment.
I don't remember the last time I felt this awful. I'm glad Macie isn't
coming home tonight; there's no reason for her to see me upset like this.
I go to the kitchen and chug a glass of water, then say screw it and grab
a bottle of wine. I unscrew the top as I make my way down the hall to my
bedroom, coming to a screeching halt in the doorway when my eyes land on
the box sitting atop my bed.
I want to ask Greer how he managed to get this in here, but then I
remember he's not here. He's gone. He used me, and now he's gone.
I shove the box off the bed and crawl under the sheets, still wearing his
pants and still holding on to my wine. I close my eyes, pushing out all
thoughts of what just happened.
I have no idea how long it takes me to fall asleep. All I know is it's the
worst night of rest I've ever had.

GREER
I'm running late.
I fucking hate running late, and I really hate running late when it
involves a beautiful woman.
“Listen, all I'm saying is, maybe things would have been different if JC
was the one whose career took off and not Justin, you know? He was
clearly the most talented member of the band, but no, we had noodle-hair
boy plastered all over the cover of Teen Bop for years.”
“Fucking hell.” I pinch my nose between my finger and thumb, a
headache settling in between my eyes. “Why are we talking about this
again, Miller?”
“Because I was out grabbing pizzas for the girls, and I saw Justin on the
cover of some magazine with an article about his perfect life with his
perfect wife, and it just brought up some old feelings.”
“So you called me? To chat about NSYNC?” I rub at that same spot
again, the throbbing starting back up.
“Well, no. I called you to say you had better take good care of Stevie
tonight, but I saw the magazine and got sidetracked.”
“You called me about Stevie? To…what? Threaten me if I don't take
care of her?”
“Yep.” He pops the P, shuffling the phone around, and I watch as he
grabs a bag of chips and opens them right there in the aisle. “I know where
you work. I know where you live. And I also happen to know all of the
weak spots in your gear. So if you hurt her, I swear to God I'll make it look
like nothing more than a freak hockey accident when I slit your throat.”
“Jesus, Miller.”
It's quite the visual he's painted, one I can see very clearly. That isn't
the scariest part, though. It's how he tells me all this––with a grin on his
face and sincerity in his eyes. Miller means what he says, and it makes me
respect him.
It also pisses me off.
“I don't plan to hurt Stevie.”
“Oh, I know you don't.” His bright smile nearly blinds me even through
the phone screen. “You act like a big tough grump, but deep down, you're a
softy. I still have to let you know how it's going to be, though. Stevie's
going to be my sister-in-law someday, so consider it my brotherly duty.”
“Your warning has been heard.” I roll my eyes, but he doesn't care.
“Can I go now? I kind of have a wedding to get to, and I'm about to knock
on my date's door.”
I glance up at the 23C on the door, hoping like hell Stevie can't hear this
conversation on the other side of it. I wouldn't have usually answered
Miller's call, but he never sends me video chat requests, so I was worried
something was wrong with Macie.
Nope. Turns out he just wanted to chat boy bands and threaten me.
“You can go. Please tell Stevie I said she looks beautiful.”
“You haven't even seen her.” I haven't even seen her, though based on
the dress I bought her, I have no doubt she looks incredible.
“Yeah, but she's always pretty. I mean, Scout's prettier, but still.”
I really want to come back with something stupid about Stevie being the
prettier one, but that would be super high school of me, and I don't have the
time anyway.
“Good night, Miller.”
“Night, Greer. And remember…”
“Yeah, yeah. Skate to the throat, big accident. I got it.”
He grins. “Good boy.”
I hit the red button before he can say anything else that's going to drive
me nuts and slip my phone into my pocket. With a steadying breath, I rap
my knuckles against the door. There's a soft shuffling on the other side
before it's pulled open, and my breath is stolen from my lungs.
“Wow.”
It's all I can think of to say when I take in the woman in front of me.
I was right to pick the dress I did. The blue matches her eyes perfectly,
and the waist is flattering in all the right ways. Her tits—the ones I know
taste so fucking sweet—are pushed up high, and she's showing just enough
cleavage to make my cock ache inside my dress pants but not enough to
make me embarrass myself. The buttery-soft material swishes against her
legs, stopping just short of hitting her knees, which are still red from last
night's activities. I'd be a fucking liar if I said I didn't love the sight.
“I feel entirely overdressed,” Stevie says.
“Nonsense,” I tell her, finally peeling my eyes from her body. Her dark
hair is swept up into a bun. There are two braids, one on either side of her
head, and a pair of earrings that perfectly match the necklace I got her
dangle from her ears. “You look gorgeous.”
Her cheeks pinken, something I'd normally find cute, but something
seems off. She seems off.
“Everything okay?” I ask her.
She gives one curt nod. “Fine.”
Except it sounds like nothing is fine at all. Just as I'm about to ask her
to elaborate, my phone goes off once again. This time, I know the ringtone.
I pull it from my pocket and don't even bother looking at the name on the
screen when I hit the green button.
“Mom?”
“Jacob! Where are you? You were supposed to be here ten minutes
ago.”
“Calm down. We're on the way now.”
“Boy.” She tsks. “I swear, if you weren't so damned big, I'd bend you
over my knee and whoop your ass for telling me to calm down on my
wedding day.”
I grin. “You've never spanked me.”
“Well, don't make me start now. Just get here. I need my dude of
honor.”
“We're leaving now. Love you.”
“But never as much as I love you. Drive safe,” she rushes out quickly
before ending the call.
I slip my phone back into my pocket.
“Is everything okay with your mom?” Stevie asks, her bottom lip tucked
between her teeth.
“Oh yeah. Just her usual pre-wedding jitters. She does this every time.
We're good.”
Stevie gives me a small smile, and it's nothing like the smiles she's
given me before. In fact, it reminds me entirely too much of the smiles she
first gave me—forced and fake. I want to talk more about it, but we really
are running out of time, so I hold my hand out to her.
“Ready?”
She nods, and instead of placing her hand in mine, she brushes past me
like I'm not even there.
Between my mother and Stevie, I have a feeling it's going to be a long
night.
“I now pronounce you husband and wife! You may kiss the bride!”
David wraps his arms around my mother and dips her backward, kissing
her harder than I ever want to see my mother kissed. Everyone erupts into
cheers, and I paste on my best smile and clap along too.
She did it. She married her fourth husband. This one has to stick,
doesn't it?
They make their grand exit, and the bridal party follows suit. I catch
Stevie's eye on the way out and don't miss when she swipes her fingers
over her cheeks, brushing away tears.
Women and weddings, man. They always cry.
I don't think anything could top David sobbing through his vows,
though. He really loves my mom, which is great. I wish him the best.
We take a few photos—why my mom needs any more wedding pictures
is beyond me—then we're set free for the cocktail hour. I rented out the
swankiest hotel the city has to offer as my wedding gift to my mother. She
doesn't know I also got her tickets for a three-week trip to Ireland for their
honeymoon. They leave tomorrow, and I'm letting David be the one to give
her the news later.
I'm stopped no less than five times as I make my way through the
reception hall in pursuit of Stevie. If I know my mother, she's placed us at
the front table, which is where I'm hoping to find my date. After shaking
hands with another of my mom's favorite clients, a break in the crowd lets
me know I'm right.
I stop for a moment to admire her as she fingers the straw in her
cocktail, her other hand under her chin. She looks sad but beautiful. The
urge to sweep her into my arms and swing her around the dance floor so
everyone can see she's mine is strong.
But I don't. Instead, I slip into the chair next to her, startling her as it
scrapes across the floor.
“Sorry,” I mutter, pressing a kiss to her cheek.
She stiffens under me for a moment before relaxing.
“You okay?” I ask her for what feels like the millionth time tonight.
She's been quiet since I showed up at her apartment. She didn't even
make any comment on the red light I definitely ran on the way here.
Something's bothering her, but I'm not sure what.
“Mhmm,” she answers, lifting her drink to her lips. She takes a long
pull, then another. And one more until her glass is empty. She pushes her
chair back. “I'm going to get a refill.”
I rise, ready to chase after her. “Stevie, wait. I—”
“There you are!” my mother calls out, shoving her way through the
crowd. “My boy!”
In all her glory, my mother glides across the floor, her cream dress
dragging behind her. I think of all the gowns I've seen her in, this one is my
favorite. She looks beautiful with her gray-streaked hair twisted up in a bun
and her makeup all done. She doesn't look a day over thirty when she's
actually just two months shy of fifty.
“Hey, Mom.”
She presses a kiss to my cheek, no doubt leaving behind a smudge of
lipstick, and eyes Stevie. “Is this her?”
I nod. “Mom, this is Stevie. Stevie, meet my mother, Loretta.”
“The famous Stevie Nicks!” Mom claps her hands together. “I'm so
honored to meet you.”
“You're honored to meet me?” Stevie grins. “I'm meeting Loretta Lynn
—I'm the one who is honored.”
They laugh and hug like they're old pals, and I'm incredibly curious
why they're calling each other names that definitely belong to famous
musicians.
“It's so wonderful to finally meet you,” Stevie tells her. “I've heard so
much about you from Greer.”
“All good things, I hope.” Mom winks, then nudges me. “I'm truly so
happy you came. When this one told me he was bringing a real live date, I
nearly fell out of my salon chair. He always causes a ruckus at weddings,
and I was relieved he was going to have someone to keep him in line.” My
mother looks Stevie up and down. “I had no idea you'd be this gorgeous,
though.”
Stevie blushes. “Thank you. You look stunning.”
“Oh, stop it.” My mother waves her off, but I know she loves the
compliment. “How are you, dear? How's your daughter adjusting to
hockey?”
“She loves it. Greer's been a fantastic coach.”
It's the nicest thing Stevie's said to me all evening, and I wish my mom
would stick around so I could hear more compliments.
“Good. I'm so glad.” Mom squeezes Stevie's hands. “You have my
number, so if you ever need another pep talk, I'm just a call away.”
“Thanks, Loretta.”
“I better get back so we can make our grand entrance. I just had to come
say hello to you first.”
Mom pats her cheek, then turns to me. I bend down so she can wrap her
arms around me.
“You really do look beautiful, Mom,” I tell her, squeezing her tightly.
“I know I do.” I laugh as she pulls away, setting her hands on my
cheeks. “Take care of her.” She lifts her brows. “You hear me?”
I nod. “I hear you.”
“Good. Love you, baby.”
“Not as much as I love you.”
“Hey, that's my line!” She winks before gliding off into the crowd.
I turn back to Stevie, but she's gone. I move through the groups of
guests, hoping I don't get stopped a million times before I reach the bar. I'm
in luck because not a single soul stops me, but that high disappears when I
see the scene in front of me.
Stevie's talking to some guy.
Some guy who is leaning in closely as she throws her head back
laughing.
Some guy who is about two seconds away from being thrown over the
bar and having a bottle broken over his head.
I march toward them, sliding up right behind Stevie, leaving no space at
all between us. Her ass fits perfectly against my cock, and if I'm not
mistaken, she presses back into me.
“Stevie,” I say into her ear.
“Greer,” she mutters back. She doesn't look away from the dead guy,
but she does relax against me, and the dude doesn't miss it.
“Sorry. I didn't realize you were together.”
“Well, we are,” I tell him. “You can go now.”
He lifts his hands, then scuttles away.
Stevie whirls around the moment he's gone, her baby blues full of fire.
“That was so rude, Greer.”
“Stop calling me that.”
“Would you rather I call you asshole, then?”
“What is your problem?”
She huffs, crossing her arms over her chest. “Nothing.”
I'm about to call her on her shit when the deejay comes over the
speakers.
“Would everyone please make their way to their seats so we can
introduce the newlyweds?”
Stevie shoves past me, heading back to the table. I wish it were anyone
but my mother getting married right now so I could haul Stevie off to some
coat closet and demand she tells me what's wrong, but I can't do that to my
mom.
Instead, I follow my date and slide into the chair next to her. We clap
and cheer as my mother and David are introduced, and I swear I catch
Stevie wiping away another tear as they have their first dance. We sit
through the speeches—my mother spares me from making one—and the
dinner, not once talking to one another.
It's not until the deejay announces that the members of the wedding
party should kick off the dancing for the night that we even look at each
other.
I rise and hold my hand out to my date. She looks at it for a moment,
clearly considering leaving me in the dust, but eventually she slides her
palm against mine.
I tug her against me as the music begins to play, relishing the way she
feels pressed against me. She may be upset with me, but I don't care. I can't
not touch her right now, not when she looks as gorgeous as she does, pouty
lip and all.
“You know, everyone in this room can see that you're upset with me,” I
say softly. She grunts. “I just wish you'd tell me what I did wrong so I can
fix it.”
She pulls back, looking up at me with raised brows. “Are you serious
right now?”
“Yes, I'm serious. I don't understand what's going on.”
“Dammit, Greer.”
“Stop calling me that.”
“No.”
I grit my teeth, my patience growing thinner by the second. “What did I
do?”
She tries to pull away and run, but I don't let her. If anything, I tug her
even closer.
“No running. Talk to me.”
“You left!”
Now it's my turn to pull back. “What?”
“Last night. You just left, after…”
“After my cock was in your mouth?”
Her cheeks darken. “Y-Yes. I thought…” She exhales a steadying
breath. “I thought I was okay at first, fine with you leaving and me feeling
used—but then I wasn't. I wasn't okay with it. I'm still not okay with it.”
“Stevie, I—”
“No, Greer.” She shakes her head, pushing out of my arms and backing
away from me. I glance around. We're definitely being watched by just
about everyone in the room, including my mother, who has her brows raised
in silent question.
I grab Stevie's wrist, tugging her off the dance floor to go somewhere
more private where this conversation is better had. The moment we're
alone, she yanks free of my grasp, her arms coming up to cover her chest.
Her shoulders are hunched, and she looks sad…broken.
I hate it, and I hate even more that I caused it.
“I'm not that girl. You can't just expect me to do…that and be okay.
That's not who I am.”
“I know that.” I take a tentative step toward her.
She moves away. “Really? Because you just left.”
“I know,” I say, moving closer again. She retreats once more. “But—”
“No buts, Greer. I—”
“Goddammit, Stevie, I couldn't stay!”
Her eyes widen at my outburst, but they quickly fall to slits. “Really?
That's your big excuse? You couldn't stay? Why not?”
“Because if I had stayed, I wouldn't have been able to control myself.” I
prowl toward her.
She takes one step back for every step I take forward until she hits a
wall. She's trapped. She has nowhere to go. I lean down until my eyes are
boring into hers.
“I would have fucked you, Stevie, and you weren't ready for that.”
Her eyes are wider than I've ever seen them as she blinks up at me in
surprise.
“I couldn't stay. It's been a long time for you, and you deserved better
than what I could have given you last night. You deserve what I want to
give you tonight.”
“To…night?”
I nod. “I got us a room here.”
“You did?”
“Yes, and I plan to make very, very good use of it and the time we have
together.”
She swallows. “Oh.”
I reach out, running the pad of my thumb along her cheek. “I'm sorry I
just left. I should have said something. I should have…” I shake my head.
“I'm not good with this stuff, Stevie. I don't do this. I don't…”
“Have fun?”
My brows wrinkle at her words. It's what we said at the rink yesterday,
and just like then, it feels wrong. It's not the word I want to use to describe
this thing between us, but it's all I have.
“Yeah.”
“Oh,” she says again. “Okay.”
“Okay?”
She nods. “Okay. I'm sorry I got upset. That was stupid, I just—”
“No. Don't apologize. I'm the dick—you were right to be upset. I
should have explained things better, but I didn't, and I'm sorry for that. I'm
just… I'm not used to having to explain myself to someone. I'm not used
to…well, caring about the person I'm with.”
The truth is, last night, seeing Stevie on her knees for me…it awakened
something inside of me. I don't know what, but something just felt
different. I've been in the same position before with a beautiful woman on
her knees, but none of it felt familiar.
It was special. She was special. I knew if we were going to go any
further, I had to make it something she was going to remember.
When that hit me, I knew I had to leave. I had to make this something
better. So, I made arrangements for tonight and planned out all the things I
want to do to her…if she'll let me, of course.
“I liked last Greer. Before you left, I liked it. I… I was okay with what
was happening. It was special enough.”
“It was?”
“Yes. It really was.”
I roll my tongue across the bottom of my lip, taking that in. “Do you
want to go back to the wedding?”
She shakes her head. “No.”
“Do you want to go home?”
“No.”
“Then what?”
She lifts her eyes, her long lashes casting shadows across her cheeks.
Her tongue darts out to wet her lips, and she sucks in a breath. Lets out a
deep exhale.
“I'd like to see that room now, please.”

STEVIE
Greer's eyes flash with heat at my words.
Words I can't even believe I've just spoken, not after last night. I'm still
upset with him, but I also understand. I'd literally just told him it had been
years since I'd had sex, and the last person I'd been with had abused me. He
wanted to make it special for me, and I can't really fault him for that.
Besides, up until the moment he left, I liked it. I wanted it. And if we
had kept going, I would have liked that too.
I like that he didn't treat me gently, like I was some hurt and broken
woman. I felt good. I felt strong. And I knew that if I ever wanted to stop,
he would have in a heartbeat.
He reaches into his suit pocket and produces a key card, holding it my
way. “It's the suite on the top floor. Go.”
“By myself?”
“Yes. I have to explain to my mother that I'm leaving.”
Oh god. I hadn't even thought of that. “What are you going to tell her?”
“That you have a headache, and I'm taking you upstairs to lie down. I'll
be up in five minutes.”
I nod, taking the card. I notice then that my hands are shaking.
I'm nervous. I don't know why I'm nervous. It's Greer, and I trust him.
But I suppose that doesn't erase the fact that I haven't had sex in nearly a
decade, and it feels like I'm doing this for the first time all over again.
I suck in a steadying breath, then slip past Greer. I'm a few steps away
when he calls my name.
“Yes?” I turn to look at him.
“I want you naked on your knees waiting for me.”
I gulp, then race toward the elevators. My knees shake as I press the
button for the top floor, holding the card up to the talking machine when it
yells at me that I need a key card for access.
Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit.
I'm doing this.
I am having sex with Greer.
If last night is anything to go off of, I'm having hot, rough sex with
Greer—and I cannot fucking wait.
The elevator feels like it takes days to reach the top floor, but when it
does, it spits me out into a small hall with a door at the end. It's a big door.
A dark door. A foreboding door. A door that, once I open it, I can't close.
Am I ready for this?
Yes.
I slide the key into the slot and push into the room. It's dim inside, the
lights turned down, casting a soft, hazy glow. Soft music plays from a
speaker somewhere, creating a more romantic atmosphere. There's an ice
bucket sitting on the coffee table. Inside is a bottle of champagne—
probably something expensive—and two glasses sit off to the side. There's
a tray of chocolates that I can't resist. I pop one into my mouth and grin
when I realize it's my favorite—caramel.
I resist the urge to grab another, knowing I must be running out of time.
I check my phone.
Two minutes.
I let out a squeak. Oh god, oh god, oh god.
I try to stay focused and not fixate on how hard my hands shake as I
reach behind me and pull at the zipper of my dress. I do my best to regulate
my breathing as I let the material slide down my legs, and when I unclasp
my bra and slip off my underwear, I ignore how my knees knock together. I
fold my clothes and gently lay them on the chaise lounge, then toe off the
last item I'm wearing—my heels.
I can't believe I'm doing this. There's no way I'm doing this. I'm Stevie
Thomas, divorcée and mother of a ten-year-old. I'm not the hook-up-with-ahot-hockey-player kind of girl, and I'm really not the kinky-sex kind of girl.
But none of that matters when my knees hit the floor and I hear the
elevator chime.
This is it.
The door to the room clicks open with a soft snick. Greer's dress shoes
bounce off the floor in the entryway with sharp clacks.
Then, he's there. He's standing before me, his green eyes taking me in
as I stare up at him.
I'm wet, like embarrassingly so, but I can't help it. There's something
so hot about the way he's looking at me, like he's proud of me. I want to
make him proud.
“You're beautiful,” he mutters, walking deeper into the room. He strips
off his jacket, setting it on the back of a chair, then tugs at the collar of his
shirt. He undoes the top two buttons, then moves to the sleeves, unbuttoning
them and shoving them up his forearms.
I don't think he's ever looked better than he does at this moment.
He stalks toward me, his hands going to his belt. This feels familiar, yet
I'm eagerly anticipating it like it's the first time.
“Take my cock out, Stevie.”
Like last night, I undo his buckle and shove his pants and boxer briefs
down his legs. His cock springs free, and I reach for it, the desire to have
my mouth full of him strong. I might have felt awful last night after he left,
but it doesn't erase how good it felt in the moment. My mouth waters just
thinking about it again.
“No,” he says, stopping my efforts. “Open.”
I slacken my jaw, and he sets his cock just inside my mouth. The weight
of him is heavy, and I love it. A bit of pre-cum leaks onto my tongue, and it
takes everything in me not to react and lick at him.
“I'm going to come down your throat like I did before. After, I'm going
to bury my face between your legs until you're screaming my name, but
you won't come—not until I say you can. Then, when I've had my fill of
you, I'm going to fuck you. Only then can you come. Understand?”
I nod.
“Good girl.” He reaches out with two fingers, running them along my
jaw. “Now, relax.”
Slowly, he slides his cock into my mouth, dragging it back and forth
against my tongue inch by tedious inch. He takes his time teasing and
toying with me. I hate it and love it all the same.
By the time his cock reaches the back of my throat, my jaw is tired and
my knees are killing me, but I don't care. Having him inside of me like this
feels like coming home.
“So good,” he mutters, watching as I swallow around his cock. “Are
you ready?”
I nod.
And he lets go.
Just like last night, he fucks into me without one iota of gentleness, and
just like last night, I'm in heaven. He's using me again, but I know the score
this time, and I welcome it. I squeeze my thighs together as he has his way
with my mouth, and he doesn't miss it.
“You want to touch yourself, don't you?” he asks as I can barely breathe
around him. There's no way my mascara isn't running down my cheeks, no
way my eyeshadow isn't a wreck, but I don't care.
He's right, though. My pussy is throbbing, and I want to touch myself
badly right now. I've never felt an ache like this before.
“Do it,” he instructs, reading my mind. “Touch your cunt.”
My hand goes between my legs, and I sigh in relief the second my
fingers brush over my clit. He must feel the same because not seconds later,
he's emptying himself down my throat.
Unlike last night, I'm unable to keep it all in this time, and some
dribbles out. Greer reaches down and swipes the mess away, shoving his
cum-soaked thumb into my mouth, silently instructing me to suck it off.
I do so with glee.
“So proud of you,” he mutters, and a wave of pleasure washes through
me at his praise.
Then I'm being hauled to my feet. My legs are numb from kneeling for
so long, but it's not a problem for Greer. He drags me to the chaise lounge,
swiping the clothes I carefully folded and laid there onto the floor. He sets
me on the seat, and this time, it's him who drops to his knees.
He's still wearing his dress clothes, which I don't think is fair, but I
can't complain, especially when he puts his hands on my legs and pushes
my thighs open.
There's no preamble, no teasing like before. He's there in an instant, his
tongue on my pussy as he licks and sucks at me like a starved man.
I don't dare close my eyes, not wanting to miss a moment. Not like he'd
let me anyway. I remember the rule.
He sucks my clit into his mouth, and I've never been so close to an
orgasm so fast. I groan, torn between wanting to come so badly and wanting
to please him at the same time. My legs shake as I try to hold it off, and
Greer laughs.
He laughs.
He eases his ministrations, and my impending orgasm fades, but Greer
isn't satisfied with that. He eats at me, bringing me to the brink again, then
backs off. He does it two more times until I can feel sweat sliding down my
back, and my legs shake around his head as I try to stave off the wave that
so desperately wants to hit me.
“Do you want me to stop?” he asks, eyes glistening like he's the one
getting off on this.
I want to nod, but it somehow comes out as a headshake. There's no
way I can keep going. If his tongue touches me again, I'm a goner, but I
don't want to stop. I don't want to disappoint him. I want to be good for
him.
He lets out another dark chuckle, then kisses his way up my body,
paying extra attention to the marks on my stomach, and he takes a turn
kissing each of my breasts before planting his lips over mine. I should
probably be grossed out, kissing him after he just spent so much time
between my legs, but I'm not. I like the way I taste on his lips.
He kisses my mouth, then my nose, my cheek, all the way to my ear,
where he makes the sweetest promise I've ever heard.
“I'm going to fuck you now, Stevie.”
A whimper claws its way out of my throat.
“Do you want that?” He pulls back, running a finger over my cheek as
he stares into my eyes. “Do you want to see how well you take my cock?”
I nod.
“Say it.”
I slide my tongue over my lips. “Please, Greer. I want your cock.”
“Such a good girl,” he murmurs. Then he shoves away, holding his hand
out to me. “Come.”
I let him pull me up, then steer me toward the bedroom, his hands
running over my body the entire time. He spins me around when I reach the
bed, capturing my mouth with his and kissing me hard enough to leave a
bruise.
I'm out of breath when he finally relents, giving me a gentle shove onto
the mattress. I fall backward, watching as he unbuttons his dress shirt, then
peels it off his shoulders. He removes his undershirt, his belt. He shoves his
pants and boxer briefs down his legs, kicking them off somewhere to the
side.
Finally, he's naked before me, and holy hell is it a sight worth waiting
for. He's lean but full of muscles. His shoulders are broad, his abs defined,
his thighs rock solid.
He's beautiful.
He laughs. “Thank you.”
“Oh shit, I said that out loud, didn't I?”
“You did.”
I blush, and he doesn't miss it.
“Don't be embarrassed, Stevie. I work hard for my body. I'm glad you
enjoy it. I enjoy yours too.” He sets a knee on the bed, his hand wrapping
around my ankle as he drags his eyes over me. “You're gorgeous.”
“Stop,” I mutter, starting to feel shy, which is ridiculous considering
everything else tonight.
“I mean it. You're stunning, and I want to worship your body properly if
you'll let me.”
“Oh yeah?”
A sinister smile tugs at his lips. “Not tonight, though. Tonight, I'm
going to fuck you hard.”
Without warning, he climbs into the bed, grabbing my legs and yanking
me toward him. He fits himself between my thighs like it's right where he
belongs.
He runs his nose along my neck, pressing kisses to my throat. “You
smell incredible. Like caramel candies.”
“I always have them in my purse. They're my favorite.”
“They're my favorite now too.”
He kisses my neck again, and I giggle, but it quickly turns into a sigh
when I feel his cock press against the part of me that hasn't seen action in
far too long. He feels foreign and familiar all at once, sliding along my
pussy, teasing at my entrance.
“I need…”
“What, Stevie? What do you need?”
I grab his face, pulling it to mine. I look him right in the eyes and say,
“Fuck me, Greer. Please.”
He doesn't waste a moment, slamming himself home. I let out a loud
yelp, the sting of not being fucked for so long making it hurt, but the pain is
gone in seconds, replaced by nothing but pleasure as Greer rocks into me.
“Fucking hell,” he curses as he buries himself until he has nothing left
to give. “You're…” He huffs out a labored breath. “Incredible. You feel
fucking incredible.”
I feel incredible? He feels incredible. I don't think anything could ever
get better than this moment.
Slowly, he rocks into me, and I lied—this moment is better. His cock
drags along every right spot, and I can already feel myself getting close to
the orgasm that's been just out of reach all night.
“More,” I tell him.
He growls out his approval, and before I know it, I'm flipped onto my
stomach and dragged to my knees, where Greer pounds into me again at the
same time his hand comes down on my ass. It stings, but I welcome it. He
swats at me again, and I'm almost embarrassed by the moan that escapes
me.
“My handprint looks good on you. Maybe one day, you'll let me spank
you properly.”
Goose bumps rise on my skin at the thought of Greer bending me over
his knee and paddling my ass.
One hand kneading the red mark he's just made and the other fisting my
hair in a tight hold that borders on painful, Greer folds himself over, rutting
into me as he kisses the back of my neck. His mouth is such a sharp contrast
to what his hands and his cock are doing, and I like them all equally.
“Whose pussy is this, Stevie?”
A shiver races down my spine at his words. “Yours.”
“Whose?” he growls into my ear again.
“Yours!”
“That's right. Mine, mine, mine.” Each word is enunciated with a hard
thrust as his hand moves from my hair to my throat. He presses lightly just
on either side of my esophagus, testing the waters, but I'm good. I trust
him. I trust this.
He doesn't relent as he pounds into me so hard there's no way I'm not
going to feel this tomorrow. I'm glad because I want to feel it tomorrow. I
want to feel this always. I want this moment seared into my brain, into my
body. I want to be ruined by him…if I'm not already.
I squeeze my eyes tightly together as he fucks into me, my orgasm so,
so close but just out of reach.
That's when I feel it. Something warm slides down my back and into
my ass. It's his spit; I know it is. Something hot and heavy presses against
the hole that hasn't been explored before, and Greer's thrusts slow when he
realizes I've tensed up.
“Relax,” he says softly, and I do. “That's my girl,” he murmurs as he
presses his thumb into me, massaging my throat at the same time.
It's uncomfortable at first, but I don't hate it. I feel him spit again, his
thumb pushing in deeper.
“God, I can't wait to fuck you here,” he says, the pace of his movements
picking up. “Your ass is going to stretch around my cock so beautifully.”
I moan at the thought. It's not something I've ever wanted before, but
with Greer, it sounds like paradise.
“Oh, you like that, huh?” I nod. “Next time, I'll come prepared, and this
ass is going to be mine.”
“Yours,” I echo.
“Do you want to come?” he asks, still sliding his thumb in and out of
my ass with his thrusts.
“Please,” I beg, my body literally shaking with the need for a release.
“Put your hand on your pussy, beautiful, and come for me like the good
little girl you are.”
I slip my fingers between my legs, and it takes all of two touches to my
clit before I fall over the edge. Wave after wave hits me, each one
enunciated by Greer's thrusts.
“So perfect,” he groans. “So…fucking…perfect.”
He stills, emptying himself into me, and at that moment I realize what
just happened.
We didn't use a condom.
“Fuck,” he murmurs like he's just realized too. “Stevie, I—”
I shake my head. “It's okay. I'm on birth control.”
“I get tested every month,” he says.
“I trust you.”
He sighs, holding on to my hips as he slips out of me. I can feel him
leaking out between my thighs as he turns me over, and I relish the mess
we've made.
Greer slides off the bed, and I hear him pad out of the bedroom as I lie
there, trying to catch my breath. I'm exhausted. I think the last time I felt
this worn out was when I was lying in the hospital bed after I gave birth to
Macie.
I jump at the sudden intrusion between my legs.
“Sorry,” he mutters, dragging a wet washcloth over me, cleaning away
everything we just did.
He tosses it aside, then climbs into the bed next to me, tugging me to
him until I'm practically on top of him. His heartbeat is erratic under my
ear, thumping away in record time, and it's the sweetest melody I've ever
heard, lulling me into slumber.
“Sleep, Stevie,” he whispers, brushing a kiss to my forehead. “Sleep.”
It's the most restful night I've had in ages.
17
GREER
I'm alone when I wake up. I know it before I even reach over to find the
spot beside me empty and cold.
Did I dream last night?
I roll over, and the ache in my body tells me there's no way it was a
dream.
I slept with Stevie. Not only did I sleep with her, it was the best sex I've
ever had in my life.
There's a clatter from somewhere in the room, and then I hear the
shower kick on.
She's still here.
I don't know why I'm so relieved by that. If this were any other person
on any other night, it would be me who'd snuck out.
I toss the sheet off me, climb out of bed, and make my way to the
bathroom. The door is cracked, and I peek inside. Thank God for glass
shower doors because it gives me the perfect view as Stevie stands under
the spray of water, her head tossed back as it cascades over her body.
Fuck me, she's so gorgeous. I don't know how I've stayed away as long
as I have, especially now, knowing how well her body responds to me.
I was scared she would tell me to get lost when I told her I wanted her
on her knees for me, scared she would tell me to screw off when I denied
her orgasm after orgasm. I thought for certain she'd run when I said I
wanted to spank her with something other than my hand or she'd bolt when
I said I wanted to fuck her ass, but she did none of those things. She
welcomed them all.
I push on the door, and her eyes spring open.
“Greer.” She says my name softly like a prayer.
I pad deeper into the bathroom, lifting the toilet seat.
“What are you doing?”
I peek at her over my shoulder. “Taking a leak.”
“I'm showering.”
“I can see that. I'm taking a leak.”
“But I'm showering.”
“And I'm still taking a damn leak.”
“You can't be in here,” she argues. “I'm showering!”
I sigh, finishing up, then shutting the lid and flushing.
“I had my tongue in your pussy last night, Stevie,” I tell her as I wash
my hands. “You rode my cock like a fucking cowgirl rides a bull at the
rodeo. I'm pretty sure seeing you in the shower isn't a big deal.”
Her cheeks flush. “That was…different.”
I cross my arms over my chest, then lean against the doorjamb. “Was
it?”
She nods. “Yes. That was…in the heat of the moment.”
“Hmm.”
“Ugh!” She groans. “Why did I sleep with you?”
“I didn't hear you complaining about it last night. Actually, it sounded a
lot like praise. No, wait—that was me doing all the praising and you
coming from my words alone.”
“I hate you.”
I smirk. “Liar.”
“I was drunk.”
“You were stone-cold sober.”
“It was a late-night mistake, like eating a pint of ice cream at midnight.”
“Pretty sure that was much more satisfying than a pint of ice cream.”
She glowers at me. “Hate. You.”
I shove off the wall and stalk toward her, ready to punish her for her
words.
“What are you doing?” she squeaks as I pull the shower door open.
“Getting annoyed with how long you're taking because I have practice.”
“In like two hours!” she tosses back as I close the door.
“True. But I also have plans for you.”
“Greer, I—”
Her weak protests are silenced when I slant my mouth over hers,
crowding her against the wall as the water splashes against my back. Our
tongues tangle together so long the water begins to turn cold, but I don't
care, and it doesn't seem like Stevie does either.
Not when she wraps her legs around my waist, and certainly not when I
slide my cock inside of her.
Not when I slowly thrust into her, and not when I draw circles over her
clit, making her fall apart around me, only for me to follow shortly after.
I kiss her through her aftershocks, not wanting to let this moment go so
quickly. It's different than last night. Softer. Slower. Yet, it's still somehow
just as good.
“Better than ice cream?” I ask when I finally drag my mouth from hers.
“Y-Yes.” She shivers. “Sorry,” she says through chattering teeth. “I'm
cold.”
I reach over, shutting off the water, then I carry her out of the shower. I
don't bother to grab either of us towels—I'm taking her right back to bed.
“You didn't even shower.”
“I rinsed off,” I tell her, pulling the blanket up over us. Her eyes are
already drifting closed.
“Practice,” she mutters.
“I know.”
“Macie.”
“I'll make sure she's fine,” I promise.
She slips back into sleep, and I sit there watching her for a while. It's
long enough for my phone to buzz against the nightstand, telling me I need
to get up and head out for practice.
Trying my damnedest not to wake her, I ease out of the bed and pull on
the clothes I packed for today. I also grab the spare toothbrush and
toothpaste I brought, along with the clothes for Stevie. I wasn't sure if she
would want to stay the night, but I came prepared just in case.
She doesn't move a muscle the entire time I walk around the room,
getting ready to leave. I glance at the clock. I don't want to leave her, but I
really need to go.
I grab a pen off the dresser, scribble a note, then press a kiss to her
forehead and slip out the door. I pull my phone up to my ear as soon as I'm
in the elevator, tugging my overnight bag higher up my shoulder.
“What's up?”
“Tell Coach I'm going to be a few minutes late.”
“No shit?” Miller says on the other end of the line. “You're never late to
practice.”
“Yeah, well, it's a slow start this morning.”
“He's not going to like it.”
“I know. But tell him.”
“All right, I will.”
“Thanks.”
“Sure.”
I'm about to hang up when I remember. “Miller!”
“Hmm?”
“How's Macie?”
He pauses, then I hear him laugh. “She's good, Dad. We had a great
time last night.”
“I'm not…” I pinch my nose, shaking my head. “Whatever. Just tell
Coach. Bye, Miller.”
He cackles as I end the call.
“Fucker,” I mutter to nobody.
I'm not the kid's dad, and I'm not trying to act like it, either. I'm just
doing a favor for Stevie, checking on her kid. I don't care if she's okay or
not.
Okay, fine, I do care—but so what? We've bonded since I've been
training her. That's all it is. Nothing else.
I keep telling myself this as the doors slide open to the hotel lobby. I
make my way to the front counter, letting them know they can add another
day to my card and that my guest will leave whenever she's ready.
“Of course, Mr. Greer. Anything you need,” the clerk says. “Can we
help with your bags?”
“No. Just bring my car around, please.”
“Right away, sir.” The employee disappears into the back room.
I hike my bag higher up on my shoulder, then head for the front door to
wait outside.
“Jacob!”
I come to a halt just as I'm about to walk through.
“Did you really think you could just sneak away this morning without
saying goodbye to your mother?”
“Sorry, Mom,” I mutter, turning around to find her hustling through the
lobby. She's wearing head-to-toe velvet in the form of a jogging suit. I'd bet
a hundred bucks the back of her jacket says Bride and poor David—who is
wearing a matching outfit—has Groom on the back of his.
He's a better man than me because there's no way in hell I would ever
be caught dead wearing something like that, not even for Stevie.
Whoa. Where did that come from? I'm looking at the new bride and
groom, and I automatically think of Stevie.
I shake away the thoughts. I'm just tired from last night and then
waking up early. That has to be it.
“How's Stevie feeling?” My mother comes to a stop in front of me as
David tries to catch up. She's short, but man, can she walk fast. I'm sure the
four bags her husband has slung over his shoulders aren't doing him any
favors in the speed department, though. “I hope her headache is better.”
“She's feeling much better.”
“Oh good. I really liked her, you know. I wish I could have spent more
time with her, but the little that I did, she was lovely. She feels like an old
friend or something.”
“She was just my date, Mom.”
The words taste sour as they fall out of my mouth, mostly because they
don't feel true.
“Maybe, but a mom can hope for more, you know.”
“Sure.” I give her a tight smile. “Wait—don't you two need to get to the
airport for your flight?”
“You mean the flight you booked for the trip you bought me?” Her eyes
narrow. “That's too much to spend on me, Jacob. You've already done
enough.”
“I could spend a million dollars on you, and it still wouldn't even touch
how much I love you.”
She sighs, patting my cheek. “Oh, Jacob. One day you're going to make
someone very happy with the sweet words that come out of your mouth.”
Stevie's face flashes in my mind, her expression when I told her I
wanted to worship her coming front and center.
Fuck. Why am I thinking about her again?
“We'd better get going,” my mom says, pulling me back to the present.
“I'm sure security is going to be a pain.”
“I have practice to get to anyway.” I press a kiss to my mother's cheek.
“Have fun on your trip. Don't do anything too wild, and keep your hands
off the Irish men.”
“With that accent? There's no way. I'll have my fifth husband picked
out before we leave.”
“Mom…”
She swats at me. “I'm kidding. I have David now, and I'm madly in
love with him.”
“Good. I'm happy for you, you know.”
She grins. “I'm happy for me too.”
“I love you.”
“But never as much as I love you.”
I give her one last kiss, then wave goodbye to David and head outside
just as the valet brings my ZR1 around. I slide behind the wheel and gun it
to try to make it to practice on time.
I only think about Stevie for nine and a half of the ten minutes it takes
me to get there.
I'm not sure I remember the last time I was so eager for practice to be over.
I love being on the ice. Playing hockey means everything to me.
Practice is one of my favorite things because it means I get to work on
getting better at the game, and I always want to get better. I want to be the
best, and you do that by practicing.
But today…today I want to be done with this so fucking badly.
“Optional skate tomorrow morning, boys. Wright and Fitz, Doc wants to
see you,” Coach says before skating off the ice.
Finally, it's over. We're dismissed.
I skate off in a hustle.
“Damn, dude. What's the rush?” Hayes asks, catching up to me down
the tunnel.
“No rush,” I say.
It's a lie, though. I'm always the last to leave the ice, but not today.
“Uh-huh. Clearly.”
I ignore the rookie, making my way to the dressing room, already
stripping my gear off.
“How was your mom's wedding?” Lowell asks. “Good?”
“Yep. She's all married and off to Ireland on her honeymoon.”
“Ireland for a honeymoon? With those accents?” Miller shakes his head.
“Her husband is a brave man.”
I agree, but not for the reason he's referring to.
I pull off my gear as fast as I can without making it seem like I'm
rushing. The last thing I want is more questions thrown my way. I grab a
quick shower, then scoop up my bag and race to my car.
If anyone notices me hustling away, they don't say anything. I'm
grateful too because all I want is to get to Stevie. I want to talk to her and
see how she feels after everything.
When I pull into the parking lot of Scout's Sweets, it's packed. There's a
line of at least ten people, and I can see Stevie bustling back and forth
inside with Rosie. Macie's sitting at one of the picnic tables, her head in a
book like usual.
I'm not sure how long I sit there watching them like a creeper, but I
really don't want to get out when there are still so many people showing up.
Maybe it was a bad idea to come here. Maybe I should just leave.
I'm set on driving away when there's a knock at my window.
“What the—”
I look up to see a toothless, grinning Fitz. He waves, and I shove the
door open. He barely jumps out of the way.
“What.”
It's not really a question. I'm annoyed he's bothering me. I'm more
annoyed, though, that he caught me sitting here like a weirdo.
“Why are you just sitting in your car?”
I gesture toward the chaotic line. “Do you want to deal with that shit?”
He shrugs. “It's not so bad. I've seen worse.”
I huff. I forgot he's a people person and perfectly fine with standing in
line and being bothered by fans.
I'm not really in the mood for it, but he already has me out of my car, so
I might as well. I pop the door back open and pull out a ball cap, tugging it
down low, hoping and praying it'll help keep people away.
“Greer!”
Well, there goes that plan.
“Hey, kid,” I say to Macie, taking a seat at the table with her as Fitz
plops down beside me. “Whatcha reading there?”
She holds up the book. “This Team Is Ruining My Life (But I Love
Them) by Steve ‘Dangle' Glynn. This is how I feel about the Comets, by the
way.”
Fitz snickers. “Noted.”
I'm used to her shit-talking, so I ignore her. “You have a good time with
Scout this weekend?”
“I did. Miller let me paint his toenails.”
Fitz grimaces. “You touched Miller's feet? Ew.”
Macie laughs. “I did, but I made them prettier.” She looks at me. “Mom
said you guys had fun at the wedding. Did you dance with her? She loves to
dance. I assume you did because she smiled so much when she picked me
up from Aunt Scout's.”
I like the idea that it was me who made Stevie smile so much.
“We danced,” I tell Macie, but my eyes are somewhere else.
Stevie's staring at me from the donut truck, a sly grin tugging at her
lips. Is it possible she got even prettier in the few hours we've been apart?
“I'm going to grab a coffee,” I announce to the table, rising to my feet
and heading for the truck.
“I'll take one, too,” Fitz calls after me.
I lift my hand in acknowledgment, continuing my prowl. I bypass the
line, not caring about the few people who call out their protest. I don't stop
until I'm on the side of the truck. Then, I wait.
I watch as Stevie bustles around, slinging coffee and donuts with a
smile on her face. Every minute or two, her eyes slide to me, and that same
knowing grin curves her lips. When just a few people are left in the line, she
reaches behind her back and undoes her apron.
“I'm taking my ten, Rosie.”
The baker bounces her brows a few times. “Have fun.”
Stevie takes a glance at Macie, who is deep in a paper football
competition with Fitz, then meets me at the end of the truck.
“Hi,” she says softly…shyly.
I grab her hand and haul her around back, pushing her back against the
bright blue metal and boxing her in.
“Hi.” I grin down at her. “How's your day so far?”
“You know, it's not too bad. I woke up kind of early, took a shower, then
crawled back in bed and went to sleep in a big comfy hotel bed, where I
wasn't bothered by anyone for the next two hours. It was nice.”
“Nice, huh?”
She grins. “I'd say more than nice.” She pushes up on her toes and
presses a soft kiss to my lips. “I'd go as far as to say it was spectacular.”
“Spectacular, huh? That must have been some shower.”
She giggles, and I love how flirty she is right now. I wish more than
anything we were alone so I could slide my hands under her ass and haul
her into my arms and then carry her to one of those picnic tables and eat her
for lunch.
But unfortunately, we're not. We're surrounded by people, including her
kid.
“Soo…” she starts, dragging out the word. “Last night.”
“Spectacular?”
She nods. “And then some. I… It might have been the best fun I've ever
had.”
The word twists around in my gut, leaving a sour feeling that I don't
like.
“It was the best I've had too.”
“Really? I wasn't…rusty? It's been a minute, you know.”
I drop my lips to her ear. “I'd say based on the way you swallowed my
cum, there was nothing rusty about you.”
When I pull back, her cheeks are bright red.
“You can't say things like that to me right now, Greer. It's not fair.”
Fair? She wants to talk fair? I'm the one standing here with my cock
pressed against my zipper.
I crowd against her, letting her feel what just being near her is doing to
me.
“So you mean I can't tell you how I was just fantasizing about tossing
you onto a table and spreading your legs to take a look at that pretty pink
cunt of yours?” She lets out a soft gasp, her eyes sparking with fire at my
words. “How, if we were alone, I would bury my cock inside of you for
hours? How I so, so badly want to run my tongue over every inch of your
body until you're begging for me to stop, just so I can start all over again?
We can't talk about any of that?”
Her lips part, breaths coming in sharp as she stares up at me like she's
debating taking me up on everything I just said.
“You're mean.”
I laugh. “Oh, baby. You haven't seen me be mean yet.”
I capture her lips with mine, kissing her hard and fast because I know
we could get interrupted at any moment, and I don't want to waste another
second not touching her.
“Mom?”
Stevie shoves at my chest, wrenching her mouth from mine and sliding
out from under my arms. She tugs at her shirt, pulling it down, then runs a
hand through her hair just as Macie rounds the corner.
“There you are,” she says, barely casting a glance my way. “Rosie said
she's out of half-and-half and needs you to go grab some.”
“Yeah,” Stevie says, rushing toward her daughter. “I can do that.” She
doesn't spare me a backward glance as she disappears into the truck.
Macie, on the other hand, can't take her eyes off me. They're shrewd
like she knows I was just kissing her mom, but if she suspects anything, she
doesn't say.
All she asks is, “When's our next practice?”
I've never been so relieved to talk about hockey before.
“I'm not sure, kid. We have a road trip.”
“I know, but I was hoping we could practice at least once before then.”
“I might not have time. I'm sorry.”
She nods. “It's okay. Maybe we can do an extra practice or something
when you get back? I can finally wear all the gear this time.”
I chuckle because she's been on my case about wearing all the goalie
gear for the last week. “Sounds like a plan.”
“Macie!” Stevie calls out, rounding the back of the truck. “I'm heading
to the store. Are you staying or going?” Her eyes slide my way when she
says this, and I know it's a question for me too.
“I can stay here with Greer,” the kid says.
“I'm sure he has plenty of other things to do today.”
“I don't,” I say, even though it's a lie. I have shit to get done at home
and stuff to set up so my cleaners can stop by while I'm gone, but I don't
tell them that. “She can stay with me.”
Stevie's brows rise. “Are you sure?”
I nod. “I'm sure. Come on, Macie. Let's go see how many straws Fitz
can fit in his missing tooth hole.”
“Yes!” Macie pumps her arms up and down, racing around the front of
the truck.
I follow behind her, stopping next to Stevie, who is looking at me in
surprise.
“What?” I ask.
She shakes her head. “Nothing.” Then, after a quick look around, she
rises up and presses a quick kiss to my lips. “I'll be right back.”
I stand there grinning like an idiot as she walks away, wishing like hell
she'd come back.
“Greer, come on! He already has two in there!” Macie calls. “You're
missing it!”
I laugh. “Coming!”
Guess I'm spending my day here.

GREER & STEVIE
Greer: You know, I always thought Miller was the worst guy to
sit next to on a plane, but I'm really starting to think it's Lowell.
Stevie: Why is that?
Greer: I've seen no less than fifty pictures of his kid today.
FIFTY!
Greer: I swear every photo looked the exact same too. The
kid was wearing spaghetti sauce as a beard in all of them.
Stevie: It's a parent thing. Totally normal.
Greer: Right, but why do *I* have to be subjected to this
torture?
Stevie: Because he's proud of his baby.
Greer: Babies—gross.
Stevie: You really do hate kids, huh?
Greer: No. I like Macie just fine, but other kids? No, thanks.
Stevie: I take it that means you don't want any of your own?
Stevie: Not that I'm asking you to get me pregnant or
anything. I mean, we've only had sex twice.
Greer: Once is all it takes from what I hear.
Stevie: That's true.
Stevie: But I'm not. Just so we're clear.
Greer: Chill. I know what you were asking.
Greer: Honestly, I've never seen myself being a parent. I just
don't think it's for me.
Greer: Do you want more kids?
Stevie: Sometimes, but sometimes not, too. Maybe if I meet
the right person, I will.
Stevie: Greer?
Stevie: I guess you fell asleep after the long flight.
Stevie: Sweet dreams, Greer.
Stevie: That last save was incredible!
Greer: I should have never had to make it. That was a sloppy
play on our end.
Stevie: That's what Macie said, but it doesn't make it any less
amazing.
Stevie: You disappeared yesterday. Is everything okay?
Greer: Yeah, sorry. I got busy.
Stevie: Oh.
Stevie: Well, that was a great game.
Greer: Thanks.
Greer: Steve?
Stevie: Yes?
Greer: I wasn't busy. I just didn't like the idea of you with
someone else.
Stevie: SHE GOT THE LEAD ROLE!
Greer: Huh?
Stevie: Macie! She got the lead role in the spring fundraiser
play that's in April.
Stevie: I mean, it's not a real play, just a little musical the kids
put on to raise money for a class trip at the end of the year,
but there are a few talking scenes, and Macie's the lead
character.
Greer: Well, damn. Good for her.
Stevie: I'm so proud of her.
Stevie: She says it'll be good to practice her public speaking
for her aftergame interviews. I can't believe how much she's
grown. It's hard to think I was just nineteen when I found out I
was pregnant with her.
Greer: Is that how old you were when you got married?
Stevie: Yes. We eloped when I was five months pregnant “for
the right reasons.”
Stevie: I regretted it almost instantly.
Greer: How long were you married?
Stevie: Two years too many.
Greer: What was his name again?
Stevie: Ha-ha. Nice try.
Greer: Dammit.
Stevie: You can't play hockey from prison, you know.
Greer: There must be one prison out there with a hockey
team.
Stevie: Yes, because they're going to give murderers sharp
weapons.
Greer: Good point.
Greer: It'd be worth it, though. Not playing, I mean.
Stevie: It was a long time ago.
Greer: Doesn't make me want to kill him any less.
Stevie: I'm deleting these texts, just in case.
Greer: Good call because I will find out his name one day.
Stevie: I promise to bring you plenty of cigarettes when I visit.
Greer: Good girl.
Greer: Be honest…did you just clench your thighs together?
Stevie: Go to bed, Greer.
Greer: Fine, fine.
Greer: But I'm taking that as a yes.
Stevie: Noted.
Greer: When I tell you I'm ready for this road trip to be over…
Stevie: I'm sorry you guys lost. It sucks.
Greer: It does.
Greer: I wish I were there.
Stevie: Me too.
Greer: Yeah? How badly?
Stevie: So, so badly. Macie misses you.
Greer: Just Macie, huh?
Stevie: Yeah. Definitely nobody else.
Greer: Not you?
Stevie: Nah. I'm a strong independent woman.
Greer: I know you are. It's badass.
Stevie: That so?
Greer: A total turn-on.
Greer: Well, if I'm being honest, just about everything about
you turns me on.
Stevie: Everything?
Greer: Yep.
Stevie: What if I told you I shave my toes?
Greer: What are you, a hobbit?
Stevie: Yes, you got me. I'm a tiny little woodland creature.
Greer: Hobbits aren't woodland creatures. They live in the
sides of hills in the beautiful Shire, not in the woods.
Stevie: Sorry, sorry. I didn't mean to get your nerd terminology
wrong.
Greer: It's not nerdy. It's a classic.
Stevie: Right. Sure. Whatever you need to tell yourself.
Greer: I tell myself it's a classic because it is.
Stevie: Mmhmm.
Greer: Just wait until I get home, Steve. You'll pay for this.
Stevie: In kisses?
Greer: In spankings.
Stevie: Promises, promises.

STEVIE
I haven't seen Greer in over a week, and it's slowly driving me insane.
Not just because Macie won't stop asking when he's going to be able to
practice with her next, but because I lied before—I do miss him.
A lot.
Probably a lot more than I should, if I'm being honest. We've spent so
much time together between Macie's lessons and him stopping by the truck
over the last month that it's strange having him gone.
And maybe I'd like a repeat of our time at the hotel too. I swear I can
still feel his hands around my throat and the weight of him between my
legs. There was no way that night was ever going to be enough.
“Whatcha daydreaming about over there?” Rosie asks as she rolls out
some dough.
“Huh? I'm not daydreaming.”
“No? Then why did you mix the red sprinkles with the black ones?”
“I didn't. I—shit!” I quickly stop pouring, trying to catch as many as I
can before any more red ones fall into the black bin. “I'm sorry.”
She shrugs. “No biggie. We'll use them anyway. We can make donut
holes with them or something. They'll be our oopsie batch.”
I know it's fine, but it's still frustrating. I've been helping in the truck
since Scout set this place up, but it's not my favorite thing. Scout and Rosie
are the ones who belong in the kitchen, not me. This isn't what I'm meant
to do.
Granted, working at the law firm wasn't what I wanted to do either, but
it was better than this. This I'm just a mess at, a point proven by my mixing
the sprinkles.
“It's Greer, isn't it?”
“What's Greer?” I ask, closing the lid on the red sprinkles so I don't
accidentally knock them over or something—which I've already done twice
since I started working here full-time. After the law firm let me go, I begged
Scout for more hours, and she was happy to give them to me. I'm not sure I
want to stay here long-term, but it's better than nothing in the meantime.
“That's who you're daydreaming about, isn't it?”
My face feels like it's on fire as I stop screwing the lid on and slowly
look over at Rosie. “I have no idea what you're talking about.”
She grins. “Liar.”
“It's not a lie,” I lie, focusing back on the sprinkles. “I was just—”
“Daydreaming about Greer and all that hot sex you two had at the
wedding?”
I whirl around, my mouth ajar. “How did you know about that?”
“Well, I didn't officially until now.” She winks. “But I know an I just
got laid look when I see one, and you definitely had that look the morning
after the wedding.”
“I… We… Oh, screw it. We had sex.”
“Ha!” She points at me. “I knew it!” She sets aside the dough she's
working on making into cinnamon sugar twisted donuts and gives me her
full attention. “Tell me everything.”
So, I do.
Well, not everything. I leave out the kinky stuff, but I share enough for
her to get the picture.
“So you're saying he's as hot in bed as you'd expect?”
I nod. “So hot.”
“Ahh!” She claps her hands together, bouncing on her heels. “I'm so
happy for you! And totally jealous, by the way. I could really go for some
steamy hot sex with a hockey god.” She fans herself, no doubt thinking
about Fitz, who she's been crushing on since he was traded from Vancouver.
“Do you think everyone else knows?” I ask, worrying my lip.
“You mean, do I think your sister knows? No, probably not. She's not
been around much lately, plugging away on her book, so she hasn't seen
you two together. But the moment she does, I'm sure she'll pick up on it.”
Rosie's mouth twists. “Why haven't you told her?”
I lift a shoulder. “I'm not sure. I haven't told anybody. Maybe because
it's just something casual and fun. I don't need to get anyone else mixed up
in it, you know?”
She nods slowly, but it's that kind of nod people do when they have
something to say but don't want to say it for fear of pissing you off. I
should ask Rosie what she's thinking, but I don't because I don't want to be
pissed off. I want to keep this good mood I have going.
Greer comes home tonight, meaning I should see him tomorrow. That's
all I want to focus on right now.
My phone buzzes against the table, and I glance over to look at the
screen. Hmm. I slip my gloves off, then hit the green button, bringing the
phone to my ear.
“Hello?”
“Stevie!” Bianca's loud voice rings over the line. “How are you?”
“I'm doing well, Bianca. How are you?”
I haven't talked to her since the night at the bar, not only because I've
been busy but because she hasn't called. You'd think when someone leaves
so suddenly like I did, the people you were out with would call to check up,
but not one of them did. It really cemented the fact that even though we
may have something in common like our kids going to the same school, we
aren't going to be friends anytime soon.
“Oh, you know, the usual—running around like a chicken with my head
cut off, taxiing the kids around.” She laughs loudly; it sounds so fake and
forced it makes me feel sick. “I'm calling to run something by you. Do you
have a moment?”
I look out at the empty lot. We should have a good half hour before
there's any sort of midday pickup.
“Sure. What's going on?”
“Well, you know how the kids are doing the fundraiser thing, right?”
“Of course. Macie has the lead speaking role.”
“Oh. That's lovely.” It doesn't sound like she thinks it's lovely at all.
“Okay, I was wondering if, since you know all those guys, you could get
some of the Comets to come?”
“Oh, um, I'm not—”
“I heard about you showing up at school with Greer. All the kids are still
talking about it, and I think he would be a great pick. He could really bring
a lot of the parents out, and maybe they'll spend some more money.”
I hadn't realized Greer showing up there was still such a hot topic. Sure,
the kids were buzzing about it for a few days after—hell, even Macie
couldn't stop talking about it—but that was weeks ago. Surely there's
something else for them to talk about by now, not to mention I really don't
feel comfortable asking Greer for favors like that. He's already done so
much for Macie and me. I can't ask him for more.
“Bianca, I—”
“This fundraiser is just so important. It's for the kids, you know?”
Ugh. She just had to throw that in my face, didn't she?
I mean, there's no harm in asking, right? For the kids and all.
“I can ask him.”
“Oh, wonderful! That's so great.”
“I'm not sure he'll say yes.”
“Nonsense. I'm sure he'd love to help the children too.”
I roll my eyes because she really doesn't know Greer at all.
“Well, listen, I have to run. Thanks for getting this done. Us busy moms
on the PTA really appreciate it.”
I try not to react to the subtle dig about me not joining any school
activities and force cheeriness into my voice. “Sure thing.”
“Toodles!”
The line goes dead, and I make a promise to myself to ignore her calls
in the future.
“Everything okay?” Rosie asks when I let out a long sigh and rub at my
temples.
“Yep. Just parental politics.”
She crinkles her nose. “Hard pass on that.”
I laugh. “You're telling me.” I point behind her. “Can you pass me that
pink icing?”
She hands it over, and I turn away, pulling on new gloves and getting to
work on refilling the piping bag she'll need in a bit. We work in silence for
a bit, me refilling the decorating station and her twisting dough together.
After probably thirty minutes, she's the one to break the silence.
“For what it's worth, I think you and Greer being together is good. He's
a different guy with you, a better guy. You could be really amazing for each
other.”
I've tried hard not to think about us together because we said it was fun
and that was it.
But if I really let myself think about it…I believe she could be right.
I've spent two hours trying to fall asleep, but it's just not happening. I tried
reading, I tried watching TV. Hell, I even did all the yoga poses I know. I
mean, sure, it was only two, but it should have helped, right?
Either way, nothing is working. I'm wide awake, and I think I know
why.
Greer's home. He's back. Right here in North Carolina, and he's just a
few miles away.
I want to see him so badly, but I can't. I have to wait until tomorrow…
or maybe even the next day, I don't know. We haven't made any plans,
something that's killing me too, not that I'd admit that to him or anything.
It's just—
Ting!
What the hell?
I stop moving around in bed and hold my breath, waiting to see if any
other noises pop up.
Nothing. Must have been a neighbor or the old pipes in the building
making a noise.
I punch at my pillow for the twentieth time tonight, then flop back onto
the mattress. I close my eyes and try to convince myself this is the time I'm
actually going to fall asleep.
Ting!
My eyes fly open. It's the same noise as before, that same high-pitched
ting.
I sit up, listening closely. Is Macie awake? That's not likely—the kid
sleeps like the dead.
I wait. Nothing.
Ting!
I look to my right.
The window.
I crawl out of bed and tiptoe my way over to it, my heart hammering in
my chest. We're up on the third floor, so there's no way there's someone
there, but that doesn't mean I'm not scared to look.
Ting!
I let out a loud yelp, slamming my hand over my mouth.
“Fuck!” It's one word, but it's enough for me to recognize the deep
timbre.
I yank open the curtain and look down, my heart hammering in my
chest for a totally different reason.
Greer.
I scramble to the bedside table and grab my phone, going to my recent
calls and swiping on his name. It barely rings before I hear him pick up.
“Did I scare you?” he whispers, though I don't know why. He's the one
outside throwing rocks at windows. It's not like he's trying to be quiet.
“Yes. What are you doing?”
“Throwing rocks at your window.”
“I know that, but why?”
“Because.”
“Because why?”
“Because I'm home.”
“You're home.”
He clears his throat. “Can I come up? I can't sleep.”
“I'll meet you at the door.”
“I was going to knock, but I didn't want to wake Macie. That's why I
didn't call either. I wasn't sure if you had your volume on. I know she has
school tomorrow.”
“That kid could sleep through a hurricane,” I tell him as I make my way
out of my bedroom toward the front door. “In fact, she has before.”
“Impressive.” I can hear him climbing the stairs.
“That she is.” I look through the hole in the door, watching and waiting
for him to appear. “So, how many times did you hit the wrong window?”
“Twice. Did you know your neighbor sleeps naked? He manscapes, you
know. Like completely manscapes.”
“That is way more than I ever wanted to know about Mr. Henry.”
“It's more than I wanted to know about him too.”
I laugh, but it's cut short when I see him striding down the hall. I pull
the door open, not caring that I'm wearing my nightgown and there could
be anyone else out here prowling about.
Greer stops about fifty feet away, his eyes raking over my body,
narrowing only slightly when he sees what I'm wearing.
“You're practically naked.”
“I am not. I have a nightgown on.”
“A silky, slinky, pink nightgown. I can see your nipples from here.”
“It's cold out.”
“Or you're glad to see me.”
“It's cold out,” I argue, though we both know it's pointless. It's him, and
we both know it.
The point is proven even more when my whole body starts to hum as he
takes me in from head to toe. I lose my breath just from the way he's
looking at me, like I'm something to eat and he hasn't been fed in days.
“What are you doing?” I ask, my chest heaving.
“Trying to decide if I should rip your gown off or be a gentleman.”
“Well, considering I paid good money for this, I vote the latter.”
“But the former is so much more fun.”
I squeeze my thighs together at the thought of him literally ripping my
dress from my body. He doesn't miss it.
“Tell me something, Steve…”
“Yes?”
“Did you miss me?”
So much. So damn much it almost hurts. Much more than I'm ready to
admit, and more than he's ready to hear, I'm sure.
So I don't say anything at all. I just nod.
“Say it,” he instructs.
“I missed you, Greer.”
Even from here, I can see the way his eyes darken at my words, and
before I know it, he's closed the distance between us, and his mouth is on
mine. He crashes his hands through my hair as he tips my head, kissing me
roughly like he'll never get enough. I have no idea what happened to my
phone or to his; all I know is how good it feels to be back in his arms, and
it's really, really fucking good.
I'm not sure how long we stand there kissing, but it's well past
appropriate. When he finally drags his lips from mine, they feel swollen,
and I miss him all over again.
“Hi,” he whispers against my mouth.
“Hi.”
“Can I come in?”
“Yes.”
He pushes the door shut behind him, his hand still on my waist. That's
where it stays as he steers me through the apartment like he's been here a
thousand times before. He doesn't stop until we're tucked away in my
bedroom, the door softly closing behind us.
“How'd you know which bedroom is mine?” I ask as he strips his suit
jacket off.
I didn't notice at first that he's still wearing his fancy clothes. That must
mean he came straight here from the plane.
I like that he came straight from the plane.
“Well, one door is closed, and the other says Macie's Room, Keep Out
or Else on it, so I took a shot in the dark.”
I laugh. “Good detective skills.”
“I'm a regular ol' Sherlock.”
He sets his jacket on the small chair I have at my vanity, then peruses
the room.
I try to see the space through his eyes, but all I come up with is
messiness. Aside from the yoga mat in the middle of the floor, I have a pile
of clothes I need to fold sitting in a basket in the corner, and three pairs of
shoes sit in front of the closet instead of inside it. There are photos of Macie
and me up on my dresser and a few of my favorite drawings she's done
taped to my mirror.
Other than that, there's not much. It's plain and small and nothing
special at all.
“This is exactly what I pictured your room would look like.”
“Really?” I ask. “This tiny?”
“This cozy.”
“There's that word again.”
“What? My place is cold and barely lived in. This feels like someone
actually sleeps here.”
“Someone does actually sleep here.”
His eyes fall to the yoga mat, and I laugh.
“All right, fine. You caught me. I couldn't sleep, so I was trying some
yoga.”
“How'd that go?”
“Well, I fell on my face twice and am still awake.”
“Twice, huh?” He stalks toward me.
“Uh-huh.”
“Did you hurt yourself?” He rakes his eyes over me again. “Anything I
should check out?”
I roll my lips together, tucking away the smile that's threatening.
“Maybe.”
“Show me.”
I'm not sure what's come over me, no clue where the real Stevie has
gone. The real me, the one who is just a single mom who works tirelessly to
make a good home for her daughter? Well, she'd never stand in front of a
man with hungry eyes, pull her nightgown up, and point to her pussy.
“Here.”
His eyes slide to the place between my legs. “Is that so?”
“Yes. I think…I think it needs a kiss.”
“Hmm,” he says. “I think I have a remedy for that.”
“You do?”
He nods. “But you're going to have to be very, very quiet. Can you be a
good girl and do that?”
I trap my bottom lip between my teeth and nod.
“Good. On the bed.”
I do as I'm told, and he follows behind me, grabbing my hips and
flipping me around when I move too slowly for him. I let out a loud yelp,
and he slaps his hand over my mouth.
“Shh! You said you'd be quiet. No noise, got it?” I bob my head up and
down. “Good.”
He slowly pulls his hand away, replacing it with his lips. He kisses me
senseless until I'm writhing beneath him, begging for any kind of friction I
can get.
He laughs darkly. “Someone's eager.”
“I told you—I missed you.”
“You missed my cock,” he comments, kissing his way down my neck
and over my chest. He sucks a hard nipple into his mouth through my silk
gown, and I sigh with relief. He does the same to my other breast before
making his way down my stomach, and he doesn't stop until he's shoving
my dress up higher and pressing kisses to my mound. He rubs his nose
against me, inhaling me with a growl.
It shouldn't be hot. I shouldn't be turned on by this. But I am.
“God, I fucking missed this pussy. Did this pussy miss me too?”
I nod, afraid to make a noise.
“You can answer me, Stevie.”
“Yes,” I whisper. “Yes.”
He hums his approval, the vibrations rocking through me. “I'm going to
lick your cunt now. I'm going to eat at you until you're squeezing my
tongue, and you're not going to make a single noise. Do you understand?”
I nod again.
“Good.”
Then, he makes good on his word.
He drives his tongue into my already wet pussy, licking and sucking at
me like he's never going to get enough. He spreads my legs open, wrapping
my thighs around his head like they're his favorite accessory, and plunges
his tongue inside of me. I nearly let out a scream as he sucks my clit into his
mouth, but I bite down on my lip just in time.
It's hard to keep quiet, especially when it feels so good, but I do. In fact,
I don't make a single peep as my orgasm races through me, letting my
shudders and shaking legs speak for themselves.
When the last of my aftershocks shoot through me, Greer gives me one
last lick before pressing a soft kiss to my clit and sitting up on his knees as I
work to catch my breath. His face is shiny with my release, his hair a mess
from my hands running through it, and somehow, he still looks incredible.
“You good?” he asks, the cockiness leaking out of every word.
I nod, and he laughs.
He crawls over me, pressing his lips to mine in a brief kiss. “You did so
good.”
I melt at his words and reach for the buckle on his pants, but he grabs
my hands, stopping me. I look up at him, brows furrowed.
“Not tonight.”
My bottom lip juts out. “But…”
“Trust me, that was as good as any orgasm you could give me.”
“Are you sure?”
“I'm sure.” He presses a kiss to my head. “Bathroom?”
I point toward the dresser. “Other side of the hall.”
He climbs off the bed, then disappears out of the room. I fix my dress
while he's gone, brushing my hands through my hair.
When he returns, he clicks the bedroom light off. The moon shines in
through the sheer curtains, and I watch as he pulls off his shirt and pants,
folding them nicely and setting them on the chair along with his jacket. He
grabs his phone, hitting a few buttons on the screen before he pads across
the room and pulls the blanket back, sliding in next to me.
He opens his arms, inviting me to curl up next to him, and I accept the
invitation. I rest my head on his chest, letting my fingers dance through his
smattering of chest hair. I let them run over his abs and down, down, down,
right to the waistband of his underwear.
He grabs my hand, stopping me.
“No.”
“But…”
“Sleep.”
I sigh, only a little upset I can't reciprocate. “Yes, sir.”
The sting comes out of nowhere, his hand landing hard against my ass.
“Don't tease, Stevie. Sleep.” He kisses my head. “Good night.”
“Night, Jacob.”
For the first time tonight, I have no problem falling asleep.

GREER
“I hear you're training a kid,” Hayes says, dropping into the stall next to
me. It's not even his usual place, but he doesn't seem to care.
“Yep,” I answer, stripping off my water-soaked jersey.
Practice was brutal today. Coach Heller had us running drills for nearly
an hour after our loss last night. He wants us to be back to where we were,
no fuckups, so we can go back on the road with a win under our belt.
“How's that going?”
“Well, she's upright on the ice, so I guess good.”
“Goalie, right?” he asks.
“Yeah, but she seems interested in all the positions, so it might not
stick.”
Hayes nods, removing his own gear. “It's the donut truck girl, yeah?”
“What?”
“The kid you're training—she belongs to the donut truck girl, right?”
“Stevie.”
“That's the kid?”
I shake my head. “No, that's the mom. Macie is the kid.”
“Right.” Hayes nods again. “Same one from the bar, yeah?”
My eyes narrow as I grow agitated with his line of questioning. “Yes.”
“Hmm.”
I stop removing my gear and sit up, staring over at him. It takes him a
second to realize I'm looking his way.
“What?” he asks, but I see the fucker's lip twitch.
“Don't what me. Why the fuck are you asking?”
“I'm just curious.”
“Why?”
“Huh?”
I clench my jaw. “Why are you asking?”
“You've just been spending a lot of time with her is all.”
“Because I'm helping her kid.”
“Right, and you helped her, didn't you? That night, I mean.”
That's right; he was there. I didn't think he was paying attention, but I
guess I was wrong.
“Yes. She went to my mother's wedding with me.”
His reddish brows shoot up. “Hmm.”
It's his second hmm of the conversation, and I'm officially fed up.
“Just fucking say whatever it is you're going to say.”
He holds his hands up. “Nothing, man. Just interesting.”
“How so?”
“Well, for starters, you hate people and kids.”
“Ugh.” I groan. “I don't fucking hate kids. Why does everyone say
that?”
“Because you literally ran away when Lowell tried to hand you his, and
that's the cutest damn baby I've ever laid my eyes on.”
“She was crying. I don't do crying babies.”
“She was not crying. She was being her usual cute self.”
“Yeah, with snot running out of her nose.” I shudder. “No-fuckingthanks.”
The other guys start piling into the room, some of them stripping out of
their own gear, a few just sitting there trying to catch their breath.
“What are we talking about?” Miller asks, running a towel across the
back of his neck.
“Greer's training some kid.”
“No shit?” Rhodes asks, his own brows raised.
“You hate kids,” Lowell chimes in. “You literally ran away from mine.
Really rude considering Freddie is the cutest child I've ever seen.”
“See?” Hayes says, bumping his shoulder against mine.
I shove him away, and he laughs.
“Who are you training?” our captain asks.
“Scout's niece,” Miller answers. “She's ten and loves hockey. I'm her
favorite player.” He grins proudly.
“Pretty sure after I let her sit behind the wheel of my ZR1 and I'm
giving her free hockey lessons, I'm her favorite,” I tell him, elated to burst
his bubble.
He flips me off, and I pretend to catch it, kiss it, and send it right back to
him.
“So everything's all good after her fall?” Wright asks.
“Wait—you knew about this and didn't tell me?” Rhodes looks at his
fellow defenseman like he just kicked his puppy or something.
“I'm sorry. I didn't know you'd care. I—wait, Rhodes, hang on.” Wright
pushes off the bench, chasing after his best friend like he's a boyfriend who
just got in trouble.
Everyone laughs, shaking their heads at them, totally used to the best
friends and their dramatics.
“Don't you have, like, no spare time at all?” Lowell asks, going into full
captain mode. “I mean, we're in a good spot right now and the post-season
starts soon, but this is the time we need to be most focused.”
“I have it covered.”
“You sure?”
I sigh. “Yes, Dad. I'm good. It won't affect my game.”
He nods. “Good. We don't need any distractions this year.”
“You have two distractions at home—that kid and your woman. Am I
not allowed to have anyone?”
He tips his head. “Is that what they are to you? Your woman and your
kid?”
“Can we not call them women? Seems a bit misogynist,” Fitz mutters.
“Scout loves it when I call her woman,” Miller comments, a goofy grin
on his face.
“Greer?”
“What?” I bite out.
“Is that what they are to you?” Hayes asks thoughtfully.
“No. But even if they were, who cares?”
This raises a few brows in the room, and I don't miss it.
It's annoying. It's none of their business if I'm spending time with
Stevie and Macie. They all have their own lives too. I can have mine.
Besides, they aren't interfering with my game, and that's all that matters,
right? I'm still playing and still winning. Who cares that I'm having fun in
my free time?
My stomach cramps, and I rub at it, trying to get rid of the sudden pain.
“They're nobody to me,” I declare, pushing the ache aside. “Just a
friend and her kid. That's it.”
“Hmm.”
This from Fitz this time.
I flip him off, just about as annoyed with him as I am with Hayes and all
his stupid questions. He just shrugs it off.
“They mean nothing,” I insist, but the statement isn't as strong as it
should be.
This time, nobody says a thing, and I get the feeling they don't believe
me either.
If you'd told me a month ago I'd be willingly going to some fundraiser at a
school, I'd have laughed in your face.
It's true what everyone says—I don't really like kids. Most of the time,
they're loud and obnoxious and drive me insane. But when Stevie asked if
I'd consider stopping by to help them raise money for their yearly field trip,
I couldn't say no.
So, here I am, at a damn school surrounded by snot-nosed little shits.
The truth is, though, I don't entirely hate it. In fact, they're kind of…
cute. They're all full of questions, and their eyes are wide with wonder.
We're standing in the middle of the hallway as parents and teachers mill
around, looking at all the tables spread out, each littered with baskets and
other things up for auction. The kids will sing some songs and tell us facts
about the overnight aquarium trip they want to take, and we're supposed to
bid on everything afterward to raise money for the trip and the touch tank
experience.
What nobody knows is I've already cut a check to the school to cover
the entire thing, so any leftover money is going to a special experience
where they get to feed a shark.
“Tell us about the time you made that save on Connor McDavid, Greer.”
“I grabbed the puck out of the air.”
“Wow!” three of them say in unison, and I've never felt cooler.
“That's so cool,” says a little boy with oversized, Coke-bottle-lensed
glasses. “I want to be just like you when I grow up.”
“You can't—I'm going to be just like him when I grow up,” Macie says,
her chest all puffed out. “I'm going to be the next great goaltender for the
Comets.”
“You're a girl!” another boy says, his nose all scrunched up. “Girls can't
play hockey!”
“Hey.” I point a finger at the little shit. “Girls can play hockey all they
want. I know some incredible female hockey players, actually. Hell, some
are better goalies than me. So don't tell her she can't do something, got it?”
The kid nods frantically, his eyes wide with fear.
Someone pulls on my shirt, and I turn to find a little boy with an offcenter tie staring up at me. He crooks a finger, and I bend down to hear him.
“You said hell,” he whispers.
“Sorry,” I whisper back. “I meant heck.”
“I won't tell,” he promises.
I do everything I can to nod solemnly and not laugh. “Thank you. I
appreciate that.” I push back up to my feet, tucking my hands into my
pockets as the kids continue to lob questions at me.
“What's it like playing with the Beast? Is he really as mean as he
looks?”
“Did you meet Sign Girl?”
“Are you friends with Fitzgerald?”
“Was it hard to move to the US from Canada?”
“Greer!”
The last voice is the one that sticks out to me the most, and I spin on my
heel to see Stevie barreling down the hallway, an older man trailing not too
far behind her.
“Hey,” I say as she approaches.
She takes in the scene around me, all the kids staring up at me like a
god, and she grins.
“Having fun?”
“Loads,” I reply, but it doesn't have that same sarcasm it usually does.
“Where have you been?”
Her phone rang about ten minutes ago, and she left me to fend for
myself.
“Greer,” she says, waving at the man behind her, “this is my father,
Cliff. Dad, this is Jacob Greer.”
Holy shit. Her dad is here.
I didn't know I'd be meeting him. I mean, sure, she's met my mother,
but that was different. It was her wedding.
Stevie clears her throat, bringing me back to the moment, and I realize
her father's holding his hand out to me.
“Sorry,” I say, finally shaking it. “It's nice to meet you, Cliff.”
His eyes narrow at the same time the grip he has on my hand tightens.
“I wasn't aware Stevie was seeing someone.”
“Oh, no, Dad. We're not dating. He's just here to support Macie. He's
been coaching her.”
“That so?” her father says, and I can tell he doesn't believe a word she
says about us not dating.
I'm not sure I believe it either because as much as I hate to admit it,
what we're doing is starting to feel a lot like dating. I've been thinking
about it frequently since the other day when the guys were giving me shit in
the locker room. I am spending a lot of time with Stevie and Macie;
practically every moment I'm not in the rink, I'm with them. We're either
working on Macie's goaltending, always going to grab dinner afterward, or
I'm finding excuses to stop by the donut truck—not to mention every night
I've been home, I've snuck over to Stevie's place in the late evening after
Macie's gone to bed. We text or video-chat every day when I'm away, and
she's all I can think about whenever it comes time to go home.
We're still just labeling it as fun but…what if it's not anymore? What if
this is something else? Something more? Something…real?
I give myself a shake, bringing my attention back to the man who is still
looking at me with uncertain eyes. I'm sure he's wondering why his
daughter is lying to him for my sake. I know if the roles were reversed and
my daughter told me she wasn't dating someone when that didn't seem to
be the case, I'd have many questions, such as Why are you stringing my kid
along? Is she not good enough for you to settle down with? Are you using
her?
I'd bet a thousand bucks that's what's going through his mind right now.
That same sour feeling from before settles into my stomach, but I swallow
it down because now isn't the time to deal with it.
“Your granddaughter is doing great,” I tell the gray-haired man, forcing
a smile. “She's a natural out on the ice. I'm sure with some more training
after she gets a few games under her belt, she'll be starting goalie in no
time.”
For the first time since he walked over here, he grins. “That's good. I'm
glad to hear it. My late husband would be thrilled. He loved hockey.” He
peers down at his daughter with sad eyes. “I'm bummed he can't see her on
the ice.”
“Me too, Dad.” Stevie pats his shoulder. “We should probably get in
there and grab our seats. The play is going to be starting soon.” She looks at
the kids. “Kids, go on in. I'm sure your teachers are wondering where the
hell you are.”
She shoos them away, and they disappear reluctantly, all of them
looking back at me, some even waving.
“We should head in too. After you, Dad.”
Stevie lets her father lead us into the small auditorium, and we follow
closely behind him.
“You know…” I rest my hand on the small of her back, dropping my
lips near her ear. “You can't say hell in front of the kids.”
“Is that so?” she asks as we take our seats.
“Yep. You see that one with the crooked tie?” I point to the stage where
the kids are lining up on platforms, and she nods. “I got in trouble with him
earlier.”
She tucks her lips together, stifling a laugh. “He yelled at you?”
“Nah. Just gave me a stern talking-to. I was shaking in my boots.”
She giggles, and I love the sound of it. It's quickly become my favorite
thing she does.
A few people turn to look at us; the lights are dimmed and the show is
clearly about to start. I don't care, though. I could watch her laugh all day
long.
“Shh!” I tell her. “The show's starting.”
She mimics zipping her lips and throwing away the key, but they're still
pulled into a grin.
Out of the corner of my eye, I catch her father staring at me over her
head. He looks between me and Stevie, a slow grin curling his lips. Oh, he's
definitely not buying the just friends line she fed him.
And I'm not sure I'm buying it anymore, either.
“You did great, kid!” Stevie says, wrapping her daughter in a hug and
pressing a loud, smacking kiss to her cheek after the show.
“Ew, gross, Mom!” She wriggles out of her mom's hold and wipes off
the kiss. “Don't embarrass me.”
“You let me kiss you every night before bed.”
“Mom!” Her eyes widen. “Oh my gosh! Not in front of…” Macie slides
her eyes my way.
I shrug. “My mom still kisses me.”
“Really?”
I nod. “Yep, and I let her because one day she's not going to be here
anymore, and I'll want those embarrassing kisses more than anything.”
“Oh.” Macie looks up at her mom. “All right, you can kiss me—but not
when you're wearing that gross lipstick that I swear I am never wearing.”
I chuckle, knowing there have been many times in my life I've walked
around with a lipstick stain on my cheek, all thanks to my mother.
“Can we go? I'm hungry.”
“Of course,” Stevie says. “Do you want to grab McDonald's on the way
home?”
“What? No! It's Thursday. It's mac and cheese night!”
“Mac and cheese night?” I ask.
“Every Thursday,” Macie says. “And I make it.”
“Yeah? I love mac and cheese.”
“You should come. Mom, can Greer come for dinner? Grandpa too?”
“Of course I'll come,” Cliff says, smiling down at his granddaughter. He
looks at me. “Greer?”
I glance over at Stevie, unsure if she wants me to intrude on her evening
with her family, but she doesn't seem to be giving any indication that she
wants me to say no.
“Sure. Why not?”
Stevie grabs Macie's shoulders. “Come on. Let's get going.”
We get stopped a few times leaving the school, and I do my best to greet
each kid with a smile but also hurry up because I know Macie is dying for
food.
“Can I ride home with Greer?” she asks once we hit the parking lot. “I
was the star of the show, so I should be able to ride in the cool car and not
the lame minivan.”
“It's an SUV!” Stevie argues, though Macie doesn't pay her any
attention, already skipping toward my ZR1, which I'm glad I drove instead
of the Viper.
“Damn.” Cliff whistles. “That's a nice car. I love Corvettes.”
“That's what Stevie said. Want a ride?”
“What? No! I already called dibs, Grandpa!” Macie yells.
Cliff laughs. “Maybe next time.”
I follow behind Stevie and her father, ensuring I drive the speed limit
and not a mile over with the precious cargo beside me.
“You did well tonight,” I tell Macie when we pull into their apartment
complex. “Even I got excited about going to the aquarium.”
“Me too. I love animals. If I didn't already have plans to play hockey, I
would do something with animals when I grow up, maybe be a marine
biologist or something.”
“I already knew I wanted to play hockey when I was your age too, but I
thought about becoming a veterinarian for a while.”
“Do you have any animals?”
I shake my head. “No. Being away on the road makes it too hard since I
don't have anyone to take care of them at my place.”
“We can,” she says. “My mom and me can stop by and take care of
them for you.”
She says it so innocently like she has no clue the weight her words
carry, and I suppose she doesn't. She doesn't realize her words have
knocked the breath out of my lungs just thinking about them in my
apartment, images of them playing with puppies and opening presents on
Christmas morning playing like a movie in my head.
And, to my complete surprise, it doesn't sound bad or scary at all.
“Mom and I,” I correct as I shut off the engine. “We're here.”
She's out of the car before I can even get the words out, racing for her
mother.
“Geez, someone's excited for mac and cheese,” Stevie comments as
Macie races up the stairs, her grandpa right behind her. She sashays over to
me, her hands tucked into her back pockets. “You really don't have to stay
for dinner, you know. I'm sure you have a lot of other things going on.”
“Do you want me to stay?”
She peers up at me, her bright blue eyes as gorgeous as ever. “I do.”
“Then I'll stay, Stevie.”
She grins. “Good. Come on, then. We better get up there before she tries
to put corn in the pasta again.”
“Corn?” I wrinkle my nose, following her up the stairs.
“Oh yeah. We get really wild in the Thomas house on Thursdays.”
“What the hell did I get myself into with you girls?”
Stevie looks at me over her shoulder. “Heck.” She winks, running just
out of my reach before I can swat her ass.
“You'll pay for that later,” I call out, trudging behind her.
“That's the plan!”
I shake my head, following her inside.
What the hell did I get myself into?
21
STEVIE
“Come on, come on! We're going to miss warmups!” Macie grabs my hand,
pulling me from the team store toward the ice.
I let her drag me along, knowing full well we're doing fine on time, and
she's just excited about another hockey game. We're using the last of
Miller's tickets tonight, and since I'm not sure when we'll be able to come
to another game, I made sure we stopped by the Comets store for a splurge.
I really shouldn't be buying such expensive stuff right now with my job
situation, but I couldn't help it. I'll deal with my credit card later.
We make our way to our incredible seats, flopping down into them.
Well, I sit; Macie stands, her eyes wide as she looks out at the ice in wonder
like she's seeing it for the first time. I hope she never loses this joy with
hockey.
“Put your jersey on, Mom. They're about to come out of the tunnel.”
“All right, all right.” I dig into the Comets-branded bag and pull my
new purchase free. It was entirely too expensive, but Macie insisted I buy it
to represent her new favorite player.
And fine, I wanted it too. I want to show him I'm here for him just as
much as I'm here for Macie.
“Come on! Let's go to the glass!”
She takes off down the aisle, and I pull the jersey over my head,
following behind her. Just as we press our noses against the cool glass, the
music swells and the guys come barreling onto the ice, the goalie leading
the pack.
He skates around half the rink, doing a few laps and hitting pucks at the
net on each pass. He stops in front of his bench and grabs hold of that
familiar green bottle, squirting water into his mouth to spit it back out. He
does it four times, then switches to another bottle to start all over. This must
be one of his superstitions.
He takes two more laps before stopping in front of his bench again and
dropping down on his knees. He kicks his feet out to the sides, moving
them back and forth like he's a frog. He's just inches from his nether
regions touching the ice, and I've never seen anyone so flexible in person
before. The way he's able to move like that is insanity. He does this several
times, jutting his feet up before dropping back down again, stretching out in
ways that shouldn't be possible. It's oddly satisfying to watch.
“Crazy, right?”
I look over to find Wright's wife, Harper, standing beside me. Next to
her are Ryan and her sister, Hollis, who is holding her daughter up to the
glass so she can watch her dad skate around.
“I didn't know you were all going to be here tonight!” I squeeze my
arms around Harper.
“Yeah, we decided last minute to come. Sometimes it's hard to get all of
us here, and when our schedules aligned, we said screw it.” She hugs me
back, then pinches my jersey. “Nice threads.”
My cheeks warm. “Thanks. Macie insisted.”
“Uh-huh. I'm sure.” Harper winks, and I know the red on my cheeks
deepens. “Where's Scout?”
“She's on a deadline. No Emilia tonight either?”
“No. That brat is working like always,” Hollis answers for her best
friend. “Rude, if you ask me.”
I laugh. I'm sure she has her hands full trying to keep the program's
media running. Her boyfriend, Smith, used to play for the team, but now
that he's retired, he works as a video coach. I'm sure he's around here
somewhere too.
“I seriously don't know how he does that. It looks like it hurts.”
I follow Ryan's eyes to Greer, who is now in front of the goal, stretching
once again.
“I bet it comes in handy, though,” Hollis comments, waggling her
brows.
I don't say anything, smiling to myself with my little secret that it does
come in handy.
The team fires pucks at Greer, and he blocks every shot that comes his
way. He looks good out there, strong and steady.
“It's going to be a good night,” Macie comments, her eyes not leaving
him either. “He looks focused.”
He really does, which is why I'm surprised when he shoves up from the
ice and skates right over to us, coming up beside Lowell, who is making
faces at his daughter and kissing the glass.
I can't see his mouth, but there's no mistaking the spark of joy in
Greer's eyes as he looks at me. I smile at him, and his eyes dip down to my
jersey. I spin around, showing him his number on the back. When I turn
back, the look on his face is something entirely different than joy—it's lust.
Pure, unfiltered lust. He likes the sight of me wearing the number 29, and
dammit, I like wearing it.
He taps his stick against the glass three times, and I have no doubt it's
his way of saying, I can't wait to take that off you later.
I clench my thighs together, thinking about what's in store for me. He
leaves tonight for another short two-game road trip, and this will be the last
time I get to see him before he goes. It's only four days, but I already know
it's going to feel like a lifetime.
Greer looks down at Macie, then holds up a puck, and she nods
enthusiastically. He tosses it over the glass for her, and she catches it,
jumping up and down as he skates away.
“Wow. I've never seen Greer be nice to a kid before.”
“Me either,” Ryan says, echoing Harper.
“He literally ran away from Freddie,” Hollis says, holding her baby up.
The chunky little kid looks so adorable with her headphones on and her
dad's number on her shirt. “How can you run away from something so
cute?”
I laugh. “You should have seen him at the school fundraiser. The kids
were all over him, and he was eating up the attention.”
“He went to a school fundraiser?” Harper asks. “Greer?”
“Yes. He even funded the entire trip they were trying to raise money
for.”
The girls all exchange a look, which I don't miss, but nobody says
anything.
Rhodes and Wright skate over, each saying hi to their wife and tossing
Macie a puck before skating off. Warmups come to a close, and Macie
bounces back to her seat with three pucks in her hands and a huge grin on
her face. We follow her, taking our seats and settling in for a hockey night.
“So,” Harper says, and just the tone of her voice has me on edge.
“Anyone else sad the guys are going on a road trip? I mean, it's short, but
man, I'm going to miss Collin.” She sighs longingly.
“I hate it when Adrian leaves.” Ryan sticks her bottom lip out. “It makes
that big house of ours feel extra empty, you know?”
“Oooh! We should do a girls' night, a big sleepover or something. All of
us, plus Emilia and Scout. Macie can come too. It'll be fun,” Hollis
suggests.
“And Greer.”
Everyone looks over at my daughter, whose focus is on the bag of
goodies I got for her in the team store, not even realizing we're all staring at
her.
“Greer?” Harper asks.
“Yep,” Macie says. “He stays over at our place all the time. Maybe he
can come to the slumber party too. He loves them.”
My heart feels like it's about to burst out of my chest, and despite the
cold coming off the ice, my face is hotter than it's ever been before.
“He never stays for breakfast, though, which makes me sad. My mom
makes really good French toast, and I think he'd love it too if he stayed.”
I can just feel the stares from the other ladies burning into the side of my
head, but that's not where my attention is. It's on my daughter.
“Macie, how do you know Greer has been staying the night?”
Oh god. She hasn't heard us, has she? I haven't scarred my daughter for
life, right?
“I just do.”
“Macie.”
She finally pulls her face out of the bag, looking up at me. “What?”
“How do you know Greer has been staying the night?”
“I just do.” She lifts her shoulders. “I've seen his jacket by the door.
One time his hat was on the counter. And because you're so happy in the
mornings. It's the same kind of happy you are after we spend time with
him.”
She says it so matter-of-fact like it's the most obvious answer in the
world, like she's not blowing my mind right now.
“Was I not supposed to know?” she asks, her brows drawn tightly.
“No, you can know.”
“Oh. Okay. Good, because I like him. I mean, I didn't at first because he
was a jackass, but now he's not so bad.”
I smile at her. “No, he's not bad at all.”
She goes back to digging around in the bag, and I sit back in my seat,
completely stunned. When did he leave his jacket by the door? When was
his hat sitting out for her to see? And am I really happier with Greer
around?
Yes.
I am happier with Greer, happier than I've ever been before, and it's not
just the sex, either. It's him. Sure, he's grumpy sometimes, but he's also
sweet. He loves his mother and treats her like a queen, and he does the same
with Macie, even putting up with her weird mac and cheese nights.
And then there's the way he treats me—like I'm the only person in the
room who matters.
I like him. A lot. And I like spending time with him.
“Well,” Harper whispers, leaning over to me. “That was…something.”
I give her a weak smile. “Yeah, it was.”
“Are you two together?”
“Kind of? I mean…”
Her eyes light up. “Oh.”
“Yeah. It's been…amazing.”
“Eeeek!” She lets out a high-pitched sound. “That's… Oh, I am so
happy for you. And him. It's about time he found someone.”
“We're keeping it casual,” I tell her as my eyes sling toward Hollis and
Ryan, who are listening intently to our hushed conversation.
“That's what Collin and I said too, but look at us now.” She flashes her
wedding ring. “We're far from casual.”
“Yeah, but Greer doesn't believe in love.”
Harper snorts out a laugh. “Oh, honey, I didn't either. But when you
find the right person, weird things happen.”
“Yes, they truly do,” Ryan chimes in, and I know for a fact she's
speaking from experience after marrying Rhodes on a drunken night in
Vegas and then staying married to him.
“Trust me,” Hollis says, “sometimes things don't happen the way you
plan, but they turn out really amazing anyway.” She presses a kiss to her
daughter's head, the daughter she wasn't planning to have, especially not
with Lowell, but did anyway.
“If it's meant to be, it'll work out.” Harper squeezes my hand.
I give her a small smile just as the lights dim, and the announcer begins
to read the starting lineup. I turn my attention to the ice, but it's a fruitless
effort. All I can think about is Greer.
Am I being foolish by playing this game with him?
He's been honest from the start about his disdain for love. He doesn't
believe in it, and I'm not stupid enough to think I'm going to be the one to
change his mind, not to mention I have a daughter, and he doesn't like kids.
He might have been successful with them at the fundraiser, but that's
entirely different from stepping into a parental role.
Am I insane to keep doing this, knowing I'm getting attached to him?
Knowing Macie is getting attached too?
Yes.
I swallow at the truth behind that answer. It's dangerous, completely
reckless, for Macie and for me. I should be protecting her from the
inevitable heartbreak that will come when Greer decides we're too much for
him.
“Look!” Macie calls, pointing toward the ice. “There he is!”
Greer skates out, pointing his goal stick right at us. A few heads turn our
way, and I try not to die under their curious stares.
The puck is dropped, and the game is underway. The first period is
mostly uneventful, neither team scoring, but there is a lot of pushing and
shoving around the net, and even Greer gets involved in it. Macie goes with
Ryan for snacks during intermission and comes back with her arms loaded
down with pretzels, nachos, and a slushie.
“Ryan!” I hiss at her.
“What?” She shrugs, her gorgeous blonde curls bouncing with the
movement. “It's a special night.”
I shake my head, laughing at how easily Ryan was duped into buying
Macie everything that caught her eye.
The second period starts off with a bang—literally. Rhodes bounces the
puck off the crossbar, the sound echoing around the arena.
“BEASSSST!” Macie shouts in a deep voice, making everyone around
us laugh.
I tug her back into her chair by her jersey.
“You're having entirely too much fun,” I tell her, booping her nose.
A collective gasp spreads through the crowd, and people jump to their
feet, their hands over their mouths as a hushed quiet falls over the arena.
“What's going on?” I mutter, rising.
Macie gasps, pointing at the ice. “Mom! He's hurt!”
She's up on her tiptoes, trying to see around the people standing in front
of us. It's the same thing I'm doing, and I'm struggling just as much as she
is.
“Who? Who is hurt?”
“Greer!”
The moment she says his name, the crowd in front of us parts, and I see
him crumpled on the ice, not moving. Everything in my body is on high
alert as I watch him lying there, a player from the other team on top of him.
The player is dragged away by Rhodes, who hauls him to his feet and
slams him against the boards. The two of them start fighting and everyone
goes nuts around us, but I'm not paying any attention to that. All I can focus
on is Greer, who is still down.
Miller helps a trainer to the ice, skating him to the net to attend to Greer.
He drops to his knees, talking to the unmoving goaltender. I see Greer nod
then the trainer frowns.
Rhodes and the other player get pulled apart, and Wright skates over to
tap his defense partner on the head as he heads to the penalty box. Lowell is
out there too, helping lift Greer out of the net. Miller grabs him on the other
side, and they get him to his feet. Everyone cheers, glad to see him making
it off mostly of his own accord. He disappears down the tunnel, and my
heart is still sitting in my throat as I fall back into my seat.
“Is he okay, Mom?”
“I don't know.”
“But he got up. That means he has to be okay, right?”
“I don't know, Macie.”
I want to reassure her, want to tell her everything is going to be all right
and Greer is just going off for protocol and will be back to the bench soon,
but I don't.
I can't take my eyes off the tunnel he went down. He's back there, hurt
and probably scared. I wish I were with him.
“You can be,” Harper says.
“Huh?” I ask her.
“You can go back there. I've done it before with Collin. Come on. I'll
take you.” She grabs my hand, pulling me from my seat.
“Mom!” Macie calls after me.
“I'll be right back,” I tell her.
Ryan grabs her shoulder. “Greer's tough as nails. He's going to be just
fine. Let's watch the game.”
Macie's worried eyes follow me as I trail behind Harper up the stairs,
but she eventually turns her attention back to the ice.
Harper leads me through the arena, only stopping when she steps up to
some very official-looking people. She whispers something to them, and
they nod.
“Of course,” the older woman says. “Right this way, Mrs. Wright.”
We're escorted through a door and handed off to another arena worker,
then led through a few different hallways. I have no clue where we are, but
I can tell we're going deeper into the building because it's getting quieter
the farther we go.
We stop in front of a door, and I already know it's where Greer is. I can
feel it.
“I'll wait out here,” Harper says, a soft hand on my back pushing me
toward the room.
I take a calming breath, then shove the door open.
“Excuse me, we're—”
“It's fine, Doc.”
He dips his head. “I'll give you two a moment.”
My eyes snap to Greer, and I nearly break at the sight of him. He looks
so defeated sitting under the bright lights.
I rush toward him, throwing my arms around him. He winces the
moment I touch his right shoulder.
“Sorry,” I murmur, stepping back. “Are you okay?”
“No.”
His voice is gruff. Stern.
“What…” I swallow the lump in my throat, then run my tongue over my
lips. “What happened?”
His jaw is set tightly, and I hear the bed creak as he tightens his grip on
the edge of the table. “That fucker barreled over me.”
“I––”
A couple of different instruments go flying across the room. It happens
so fast I don't even realize it's Greer who threw them until I look back at
him, his nostrils flaring and his breathing heavy. I've seen this crazed look
before, and I think I hate it even more now than I did then.
“He just fucking mowed me over, didn't even try to pull up and go
another way. Ran right fucking into me.”
His voice grows louder with each word, his chest heaving, his usually
bright green eyes turning darker by the second.
“Why would he—”
“Because he's a fucking idiot!” Greer yells, and I flinch at the outburst.
He's so deep in his anger that I don't think he sees it. “My fucking shoulder
had to be reset, and I'm out at least two weeks. Two fucking weeks!”
He punctuates each word with a gnash of his teeth. He's upset, and I get
why, but it doesn't make it any easier to see him like this—so out of control
with his emotions, so angry. It's hard to watch because it reminds me so
much of everything I left behind all those years ago.
“Why are you back here?” he barks.
I hate that he's even asking me that question like I don't have a right to
know he's okay after everything between us. It feels like a knife to my gut
because all it does is solidify that this thing between us really does mean
nothing.
I'm just the girl he's screwing, and that's it.
I blink away the tears threatening and clear my throat. “I wanted to
make sure you were okay. Macie was—”
“I'm not okay,” he interrupts, so much ire in his voice. “My goddamn
shoulder is hurting like a motherfucker. I'm sitting in here with you and not
out on the ice like I want to be.”
I don't know what to say to him, not when he's like this, so I don't say
anything at all. I just stand there, staring at him as he seethes at the ground,
his shoulders rising and falling in rapid succession as he sucks in breath
after breath.
I hate seeing him like this, not just because of my past but because I
don't want him to be hurt. I don't want his season to be jeopardized,
especially not when he's doing so well. He lives for hockey, and I want him
to have that for a long time.
I stand there for a while, probably longer than I should, given how he's
spoken to me since I walked in, but I can't seem to move. The doctor comes
back into the room, pulling both of our attention.
“I need to check him out some more,” he says, a clear dismissal of me.
“I'll leave.”
“Wait.”
I turn back to Greer, slowly lifting my eyes to his, afraid of what I'm
going to see, afraid of what he's going to say.
“Stevie, I'm…”
He trails off, not saying any more, and I don't wait around for him to
gather his words. I spin on my heel and breeze out the door, barely able to
hold back the tears threatening to spill once I cross the threshold.
“Hey!” Harper calls out, racing to catch up to me as I speed-walk down
the hall. “Is he okay?”
I nod. “He'll be fine.”
“Hey…” She grabs my wrist, pulling me to a stop. “What's wrong?”
“It's his shoulder.”
“No.” She shakes her head. “I mean with you. Are you okay?”
It's such a simple question, one that shouldn't have any effect on me,
but it does. It's all it takes for the dam to break and the tears to tumble down
my cheeks.
“Oh, Stevie,” Harper hums, pulling me into her arms. “It's okay. It'll be
okay.”
“He didn't even want me there.”
“Shh.” She rubs my back. “He did. He's just upset. Give him time to
cool down. It'll be okay.”
For the first time in a while, it really doesn't feel like it might be okay.

GREER
I fucked up.
I know I did. I knew it the moment she walked out of the doc's office.
She was hurt, and I was the one who did the hurting.
I wasn't upset with her—never her, but I handled it like I was. I treated
her like shit, just like her ex did. She didn't deserve it then, and she
definitely doesn't deserve it now.
“Hey,” Miller says, dropping into the spot next to me. “I heard the news.
You good?”
I nod, even though I'm not good at all, not just because of the injury that
still really pisses me off. I'm not good because I hurt Stevie. I need to make
it right, but we're leaving for a road trip tonight because we have a game
tomorrow. I don't have time to fix it.
The guys move around the locker room with sullen faces, and I can't
say I blame them after we ended up losing. It's always rough to hit the road
after a loss, and tonight it's even worse knowing I'm going to be out.
Sure, we're in a good place in the standings, but it's not just about that.
It's about losing momentum and team spirit. This isn't just a blow for me.
It's a blow for them too.
“If that fucking linesman didn't pull me off him, I swear I would have
put his face through that glass,” Rhodes promises. “Fucking shithead. He
knew what he was doing.”
I'm mad at the guy who ran me over, but sometimes a play just goes
bad. I have to believe that's what happened tonight and it wasn't malicious.
It's the only thing keeping me on this bench and not going after that dude.
Coach Heller bursts into the room, making eye contact with me first.
His jaw tightens when he sees my shoulder in a sling. He's just as pissed
about it as I am.
“Get showered,” he says to the room. “We'll talk tomorrow morning.”
Then he's gone again.
A few guys pat me on the head as they walk by, heading for the
showers. Everyone moves around me, stripping off their gear and getting
ready to hit the bus.
I take my own quick shower as best as I can, given the state of my
shoulder, then put my bag in a pile with all the others before heading for the
bus. I'm one of the first ones on, and I find my favorite seat at the back,
drop down onto the cushion, and rest my head against the window while I
wait for everyone else to arrive.
I don't need surgery, just rest. That's the best part about this situation.
The doc thinks I could be ready to go in as little as two weeks, but he
doesn't want me to get my hopes up just in case.
It could be worse, I tell myself. It could be during playoffs.
I close my eyes, instantly hit with the memory of Stevie's expression
when I threw the tools. She looked terrified, and I knew in the moment it
was wrong, but I couldn't stop. The rage had taken over, and I was lost in it.
I need to fix it. I need to ensure she knows I'm an ass and I wasn't mad
at her.
My phone buzzes against my leg, and I fish it out, hoping like hell it's
Stevie so I can apologize, but my hopes are dashed when I look at the
screen.
“Hello?”
“Hello? HELLO?! That's all I get?” My mother's shrill voice rings in
my ear.
I sigh, going to rub at my temple, then remembering I can't. I'm trapped
in the damn sling.
“Hey, Mom.”
“Hey?!” My head throbs at her volume. “I swear, Jacob, I am going to
whoop your ass.”
“You'd beat up a broken man?”
She gasps. “Oh god—what's broken?”
“Well, technically nothing, but I am in a sling.”
“Oh, honey.” She sighs. “What's going on?”
“Shoulder.”
“Surgery?”
“No.”
“Time?”
“Two weeks minimum.”
She exhales slowly. “Thank god. It could have been…”
“So much worse, I know.”
She's quiet for a moment, probably needing a second to come to terms
with the fact that I've been injured yet again in my career and she had to see
it on television.
My teammates start piling onto the bus, a few of them nodding at me as
they take their seats.
“How's Stevie handling it?” my mother asks.
“What do you mean?”
She laughs. “Don't play me, kid. I'm your mother—I know when
something is going on, and it was very obvious to me and everyone else at
my wedding that you and Stevie are head over heels for one another.”
It's my turn to laugh. “We're not in love, Mom. I don't believe in love.”
She tsks. “Don't be like that, Jacob.”
“Why not? It's not like I've seen it work out much in my life.” I know
my words hurt her the moment I let them fall from my lips. “Shit. I'm sorry,
Mom. That wasn't fair to you.”
“You're right, it wasn't, but I guess it wasn't fair for you to see me fail
at finding my person so many times. That is why you don't believe in love,
isn't it? Because of me?”
I swallow thickly. “I mean…”
She lets out a long sigh. “I'm sorry, Jacob. I'm sorry you had to witness
my heartbreak over and over again, but this life is too long to be so lonely. I
couldn't stop trying just because it didn't work out a few times.”
“Four times, Mom. Four.”
“I don't need a reminder of my failed relationships, son.”
I clear my throat. “Sorry.”
“I am too. I'm sorry I made you feel this way about love. I'm sorry you
feel as if you can't have it just because I couldn't make it work. It shouldn't
be like that. It's not fair to you, and it's not fair to Stevie.”
“Mom…” I groan. “I told you, we're not in love.”
She laughs. “You poor, poor delusional boy.”
My brows pinch together, annoyed by her words. “I'm telling you, I—”
“And I'm telling you you're wrong. If you'd just let yourself put aside
your silly beliefs and actually listen to your heart, you'd find that you're
wrong. You love her.”
“I…” But my words of denial die on my tongue.
Is my mother right? Do I love Stevie? I like spending time with her
more than pretty much anything else. If I'm not at the rink, I want to be
near her, and hell, I like her kid, too. Macie is funny and whip-smart with a
mountain of spirit.
But love?
I'm not sure.
“Do me a favor, Jacob. Close your eyes.”
“What?”
“Can you listen to your mother for one second of your life?”
I chuckle. “All right. I'm closing my eyes.” I do, shuffling down into
my seat more.
“Now, I want you to picture yourself lifting the Stanley Cup over your
head. You're happy. You just won the trophy of a lifetime, and you can't
wait to celebrate. After you take your skate with the Cup, who is the next
person you want to see?”
“Probably Miller. He's the one who is likely to score the game-winner,
not that I'd tell him that.”
“Jacob…” She sounds as tired as I feel as the bus driver closes the door
and we start to move. “Please.”
I want to roll my eyes, but she'd probably know. Instead, I shift in my
seat and squeeze my eyes tighter, firing up the picture she's just painted.
I see it, me holding the Cup. That part is easy to conjure—it's
something I've been dreaming about since I was a kid. I see myself skating
around with a long, scraggly playoff beard, yelling at my teammates with
glee. I see Wright is smiling, and, shit, even Rhodes has a grin on his face.
Miller's down on one knee proposing to Scout, and Fitz is standing there
next to a blonde. Lowell's holding Freddie in one arm and Hollis in the
other.
Then, the crowd parts, and I see her.
Stevie.
She's standing on the ice with Macie next to her, the kid bouncing on
her heels with excitement, stretching her neck trying to find me in the sea of
Comets jerseys. They're there for me because they're my girls.
My eyes fly open, and I sit up.
Holy shit. They're my girls.
“Jacob?” my mother says softly in my ear.
“They're my girls.”
I swear I can hear her smile. “Yeah, they are.”
“It's her, Mom. It's them.”
“I know, son. I know it is.”
“I… How? When the hell did it happen?”
“Well, I'm guessing Stevie's headache really cemented it.”
She laughs, and this time, I do roll my eyes. There was no fooling her
with that excuse, huh?
“So, now you've realized it. What are you going to do about it?”
“I'm going to fix it.”
“Fix it? What is there to fix?”
I groan. “I kind of…got upset earlier. Not at Stevie. It was my arm, but
I…shit, Mom. I messed up. I got mad, and I let her see it. I took it out on
her, and she didn't deserve it.”
“You're damn right she didn't.” She huffs. “I raised you better than
that.”
“I know…I know.”
“You'd better make it right with her and soon. There's no reason to let
her sit there thinking she's done something wrong when you're just a
jackass.”
I smile at her name-calling because it reminds me of Macie.
“I know. I'll make it right.”
“Good. If you're lucky, she'll forgive you. But if she doesn't, remind me
to send her flowers as an apology for raising such a shithead.”
Hell, I'll send her my own flowers. She should get them anyway after
dealing with me.
“Listen, David and I are pulling back up to the house. We were out
when I got the notification, but I want you to call me tomorrow morning,
okay?”
“I can do that.”
“Good. And, Jacob?”
“Yeah?”
“Fix it with Stevie, then tell that girl you love her.”
“I will. Love you, Mom.”
“But never as much as I love you.”
The line goes dead, and I settle back into my seat, feeling exhausted on
so many levels—physically and emotionally.
I love Stevie.
I love Stevie.
I love Stevie. The woman who wanted nothing to do with me the first
time I met her. The woman who lets her daughter call me a jackass. The
woman who is smart and kind and gorgeous and perfect in every way.
I love her.
And I need to tell her.
Now.
“Stop the bus!”
Every head turns my way as I shove up out of my seat, racing to the
front.
“Stop the bus,” I repeat to the driver.
“Greer, what the hell are you doing?” Coach Heller says, rising to stand.
“I need to stop the bus.”
His brows crush together. “What for, son?”
“I'm in love.”
Those same brows rise high. “Okay.”
“Like really, really in love, and I need to tell her.”
“You need to get off the bus because you need to tell a woman you love
her?” His hand lands on my shoulder. “You okay? You'd tell me if you were
having problems, yeah?”
I shake off his touch. “The only problem I have is that I need to stop this
bus. I need to get to Stevie.”
“Stevie?”
“Scout's sister, Coach,” Miller says, rising to his feet, his eyes boring
into me. “You love her?”
I nod. “I do.”
He watches me, looking for any sign of deceit, I'm sure, but there is no
sign because I'm not lying.
I fucking love Stevie Thomas, and I want to tell her before it's too late.
“Please, Coach,” I say, stepping closer to him. “I messed up tonight, and
I need to tell her I love her, and I can't say it for the first time over the
phone. I have to fix this before we leave…before it's too late.”
“Greer, I—”
“Stop the bus, Coach,” Wright says, standing up too.
“Stop the bus,” Rhodes echoes.
Lowell pushes to his feet. “I'm with them.”
“Me too,” Fitz agrees, also rising.
Several other players get up out of their seats, showing their support.
With his hands on his hips, Coach looks around, taking in nearly every
person standing.
“Surely you can't keep the bus going if we're all standing, right?”
Miller looks at Heller. “Stop the bus, Coach.”
“You fucking boys…” he mutters. He runs a hand over his face,
scrubbing at it several times before pinning his hard eyes on me again. “You
know this means you can't go on the trip, right? It could mean
consequences like missing more games.”
I nod once. “I know.”
“And you're sure?”
“Hockey means a lot to me. This team means a lot to me, and I want to
see us win. But her…them…they mean everything, Coach. Everything.”
He sighs, hanging his head, shaking it. I swear he mutters something
about what idiots we all are, but I don't quite catch it.
What I do catch is him clearly saying to the driver, “Stop the bus.”
I stand in front of the familiar dark door, staring at it like an idiot.
I need to knock, I know that, but I can't because what am I even
supposed to say to her? Do I start with sorry, or do I just blurt out that I love
her? What if she doesn't love me back? What if she tells me to get lost and
slams the door in my face? What the hell am I going to do then? Do I wait?
Do I give up? Do I try to convince her to give me another shot or just
respect her wishes?
I have no clue because I've never done this before.
Just knock, Greer. Just knock on the damn door.
With a steadying breath, I lift my hand, poised and ready to knock.
Here goes nothing.
I swing my wrist forward, but there's no sound because my hand never
connects with the door. It's pulled open before I can even knock.
“You've got some real nerve showing your face here.”
I look down and nearly take a step back when I see the look on Macie's
face. She's glaring at me harder than she ever has, her little arms crossed
and her lips scrunched up with disgust.
“What do you want, jackass?”
“Hey, kid,” I say softly.
Her eyes tighten.
Right. Okay.
“Is, uh, is your mom here?” I ask, looking into the apartment. I don't see
Stevie anywhere or even a sign of life in there other than her.
“No,” Macie answers, and I have half a mind to tell her she should
never tell someone her parent isn't home, but I have a really strong feeling
she's not being honest with me right now.
“Do you know where she is?”
“Nope. Even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.”
Her eyes flit to my shoulder just briefly. There's a hint of sadness in her
gaze, but it's gone as quickly as it comes, replaced with ire.
“Are you mad at me?”
She snorts. “Of course I am. You made my mom cry.”
“Stevie cried?”
“Yep. When she came back from seeing you, she was crying. She let me
stay until the end of the game, but I didn't even enjoy it, and not just
because you guys lost.”
I briefly wonder if this means she's going to get her braces colors
changed, but now isn't the time to ask.
“I didn't know she was crying.”
“Well, she was.”
Her little chin wobbles like she's about to cry just thinking about it. I
don't want her to cry. I never want her to cry. I want this kid to have
everything good in the world, and I'll lay my life on the line to make that
happen.
“I'm sorry, Macie. Truly. I didn't mean to make her cry. I was…”
“A jackass?” she supplies helpfully.
My lips twitch at her tenacity. “Yeah, I was a jackass.”
She lifts her chin a bit, and her shoulders slump just slightly like she's
starting to come around.
“Is your mom really not here?”
“No.”
“Who's here with you, then?”
“Aunt Scout. She's in the bathroom.”
“Good. That's good.” I nod. “Can you tell me where your mom is?”
Her eyes fall to slits again. “No.”
“Macie, please. I just want to talk to her. I want to apologize.”
Her arms drop to her sides, and she worries her bottom lip between her
teeth, contemplating what I've just said.
She does this for several moments before saying, “You really want to
apologize to her?”
“Yes. I really, really do.”
“Why?” she asks.
“Because I hurt her.”
“Why else?”
“I…” I exhale sharply, running my tongue over my suddenly dry lips. “I
love her. I love you. You girls…you mean everything to me. I want your
mom to know that too.”
My words chip away at her hard stare, the anger slowly disappearing.
We stand there, me waiting for her to say something, her just staring at me.
Then, after a solid, silent minute, she sighs. “She's at Slapshots.”
“The bar?”
Macie nods. “She's with Harper and Ryan.”
“Okay, okay. That's good. Thank you.” I spin on my heel, taking off
back toward the stairs.
I'm just about to them when I hear a small voice.
“Hey, Greer?”
I come to a halt, looking over my shoulder. “Yeah, kid?”
“I love you too.”
23
STEVIE
When Harper suggested we go out to Slapshots after the game, I wanted to
tell her no. I had Macie with me, and I needed to be getting home. It'd been
a long night, and all I wanted to do was curl up in my bed and sleep.
But here I am anyway, sitting at a high-top table with Harper and Ryan.
Macie's at home with Scout, who promised to put her straight to bed, and
Hollis went home with baby Freddie.
I finger the straw in my tequila sunrise. I didn't know what to order and
said the first thing that came to mind. The funny part is I hate tequila, but I
guess it's fitting for the night I've had.
I can't stop thinking about Greer and the way he threw those tools
across the room, can't stop picturing the angry look on his face as he yelled
about his arm. He was hurt, and I understand that, but him being hurt
doesn't mean he gets a pass to hurt me too. I'm not putting up with that
anymore, not for anyone, even if I am madly in love with them.
And I am in love with Greer. So, so deeply in love with him. I think I
have been for a few weeks now, but I've been too scared to admit it to
myself until tonight. Seeing him lying there on the ice and not moving…
well, it was terrifying. The only other person who gets my heart in my
throat like that is Macie.
I knew then that Greer meant the same to me that she does. I knew my
heart…it beats for him too.
I just hope it's enough.
“Hey,” Harper says, bumping her shoulder against mine. “You're
supposed to be drinking your tequila, not playing with it.”
“I hate tequila,” I tell her.
“Amen,” Ryan says, shuddering. “It only leads to bad decisions.”
“I'm not sure you're allowed to say that when you're madly in love with
your last ‘bad decision,'” Harper tells her.
“True.” Ryan giggles. “Best bad decision of my life, even when he
drives me crazy, which he often does.”
“You two are complete opposites, but it works. The beauty to his
Beast.”
A dreamy look crosses Ryan's face. “Yeah. It works.” She groans. “Ugh,
why do they have to leave tonight? Why can't they fly out tomorrow?”
“Acclimation,” Harper says. “Playing in Colorado is a wreck on their
lungs.”
“I know, I know. It still sucks.”
“Amen.”
They clink their drinks together, each of them taking a sip. I want to
participate, but I can't find the energy. Maybe it's because they're talking
about husbands, and I'm over here with a heart that's slowly breaking.
Maybe it's because I'm tired from the long week at the donut truck.
Or maybe it's because I wish I never went down to that damn room and
saw the mess that was Greer.
I have no clue. All I know is I shouldn't be here right now.
“I think I'm going to head out,” I announce.
They both frown at me.
“Are you sure?” Ryan asks. “We can get you something other than
tequila.”
“Yeah. How about whiskey?”
I crinkle my nose, shaking my head. “No, I'm good. I should get back to
Macie.”
“Okay.” Ryan huffs. “We should probably head out too.”
“No, no. Don't leave on my account.” I hold my hands up. “Stay. Have
fun.”
“If I stay, all I'm going to do is drink more and drunk-call my husband,
who is going to be very angry that I'm out without him,” Ryan says. She
tips her head. “Though, that doesn't sound all that bad. I do love getting
him riled up when he's too far away to do anything about it.”
Harper laughs. “You're so mean to him.”
Her best friend shrugs. “He's so easy to mess with. All grumpy ones are.
Stevie knows all about that, though. Greer's the grumpiest of them all.”
Just hearing his name has my heart aching. How is it possible to be hurt,
mad, and missing someone at the same time?
Harper throws me a glance, her lips pulling into a frown. “Maybe we
should all head out…”
“All right. Fine.” Ryan jumps off her stool, her fingers flying over her
phone screen. “I'm going to run to the restroom first. I just got an Uber. It's
a silver Honda, pretty redhead inside.”
“I'll come with you,” Harper says.
“I don't need to go. I'll be outside.”
They both nod, heading toward the back of the sports bar while I pull
my crossbody purse over my head and head for the door without finishing
my drink.
The cool air hitting my face is enough to sober me up instantly, not that
I had much to drink anyway. I close my eyes, letting the fresh air wash over
me.
“What a day,” I mutter.
“You can say that again.”
I let out a loud yelp, stumbling backward at the sudden intrusion. I
mean, I'm in the middle of the sidewalk, so I'm not exactly expecting to be
alone, but I didn't think anyone else was out here.
Especially not him.
I turn to my right to find Greer leaning against the wall, and my eyes go
right to the sling that's holding his arm in place. My heart aches for him and
his injury, but just as much as it hurts for him, it hurts because of him.
I fold my arms over my chest. Not because I'm cold, but because I'm
scared. I'm scared I'm about to get my heart broken, and I want to protect it
as much as possible.
“What are you doing here? You're supposed to be on a plane.”
“I'm not.”
“I can see that.”
He shoves off the wall, taking a step toward me.
I take one back.
He doesn't miss it, rolling his lips together, his dark brows wrinkling as
his eyes fall to the ground in front of him.
We stand there in silence for several minutes, long enough for the door
of Slapshots to swing open again.
“Oh,” I hear Harper say.
“What? Is—oh,” Ryan echoes.
They step to either side of me, almost like they're protecting me.
“Everything okay?” Harper asks.
“Yeah, are we all good out here?” Ryan adds.
They're asking me, not Greer. We all know that.
The Uber Ryan called pulls up to the curb, waiting for us.
“That's our car,” she says.
“But we can get another if we need to,” Harper offers.
“Go,” I tell them, my eyes still on Greer, who looks like he's seen better
days. “I'm good.”
“You're sure?” This from Harper.
I nod. “I'm sure.”
She gives me a side hug, Ryan squeezes my arm, and then they both
crawl into the Uber, their heads together as they whisper, no doubt about us.
The car pulls off, leaving just me and Greer on the sidewalk. There are
so many questions running through my head, so many things I want to say
to him, but I don't know where to start, and I don't know if any of them are
even worth saying anymore.
It doesn't matter, though, because he's the first to speak.
“I stopped by your place.”
“You did?”
He nods. “Macie answered the door.” Dammit. She's supposed to be in
bed. “I figured she'd be in bed by now since she usually is, but she wasn't.”
“Scout must have let her stay up later.”
“Yeah. Must have.” He nods, then takes another step toward me. “We,
uh, had a talk.”
“About?”
“Something important.”
“What's so important that it couldn't wait until you got back from your
road trip?”
I know there's no way he's not going to be facing consequences for
missing the bus, so whatever it is, it has to be big.
“I just had some things I needed to say to her.”
He takes another step closer, that familiar scent of his washing over me.
I want to close my eyes and breathe him in, but I can't, not when he's
staring at me like he is…like I'm his and he's mine.
“Like what, Greer?” I ask quietly.
He exhales a shaky breath as he takes another step. He's so close now I
can feel the heat coming off his body. It wraps around me like a warm
jacket on a cold winter night.
“Like I'm sorry for making her mother cry.”
I close my eyes at his words, warding off the tears that spring to life. I
really don't want to cry again.
His fingers find their way under my chin, tipping it up toward him.
“That I'm sorry for being a complete and total jackass.”
That makes me grin.
“And that I'm madly and completely in love with you.”
My eyes fly open along with my mouth.
Did he just…
“Did I just say I'm in love with you?” He nods, closing my mouth
gently. “Yeah, I did.” He steps even closer, and I can feel him pressed
against me this time. “I love you, Stevie.”
I part my lips, but he shakes his head.
“I love you and Macie too. You're my people. You're that thing I've
been missing, that thing I've been waiting on. It's you, and it's her.”
I can't even process what I'm hearing right now.
Greer loves me? Mr. Doesn't Believe in Love loves me? And my
daughter? How?
“Greer, I—”
“I'm not done, okay?”
I nod, swallowing down the lump that's formed in my throat.
“I fucked up tonight. Big-time. Like really, truly messed everything up.
I didn't…” He shakes his head. “I didn't think. I just acted. I was pissed
about my shoulder, about losing so many games when we were doing so
well. Hockey is life to me, you know? The thought of losing it terrifies me.
When I was faced with that fear tonight, I reacted like a complete dickwad.
I shouldn't have yelled, I really shouldn't have thrown anything, and I
really, really shouldn't have let you walk out of that room letting you think
for a single second that I didn't want you there. I always want you there,
Stevie. Hockey? It might have been my everything at one time, but now…
now it's you. You're my everything. You and Macie.” He sinks his teeth into
his bottom lip. “If you'll still have me, I mean.”
My head is swimming, so many thoughts running through it that I don't
even know where to begin, so I say the first thing that comes to mind.
“I'm mad at you.”
Greer sighs, hanging his head. “I know.”
“Like really, really mad. I've been through that before. I've been with
an angry guy who took it out on me, and I won't be with someone like that
again.”
“I understand. I—”
“But I know you're not really that guy, Greer. I know it's not you.
You're not him, and you'll never be him. I know that because I know the
person you truly are.”
He gulps. “But…”
“No buts.” I shake my head. “I don't have any.”
He closes his eyes, relief settling into his shoulders.
And I don't. I don't have anything else except… “I love you.”
His eyes pop back open. “You…”
“I love you. In fact, I am madly and completely in love with you,
Jacob.”
“Yeah?”
I nod. “Yeah.”
Then his mouth is on mine, and he's kissing me like he's never kissed
me before. It's different because we've never kissed while knowing we're
in love with each other.
I don't know how long his lips dance against mine or how long we stand
there, but when we finally part, everything feels different.
“I'm so sorry, Stevie.” He drops his forehead to mine. “So, so sorry. I
swear, it won't ever happen again.”
“I know,” I tell him. “I know it won't because you know I won't stand
for it.”
“Good. Don't ever let me or anyone treat you like that again.”
I won't, I promise myself.
“I think I might have loved you the first time I saw you,” Greer says.
“Or maybe when Macie first called me a jackass.”
I laugh. “She's feisty.”
“That she is. I was scared as hell when she opened that door tonight. I
was certain she was going to kick me in the nuts.”
“You'd have deserved it.”
He chuckles. “Yeah. Yeah, I would have.” He presses another quick kiss
to my lips. “Say it again. Please.”
“I love you.”
“No. Say all of it again.”
“I love you, Jacob.”
He sighs. “I'm not sure I'll ever get used to that.”
“I'll tell you every day if it'll help.”
“Every morning?”
“And night.”
“For the next eighty years.” Another kiss. “Because that's how long I
plan to love you, Stevie. Until the last breath in my lungs gives out and then
some.”
“Come on, Greer. Don't get all weepy and emotional on me now.”
He laughs. “I can't help it. I'm a man in love.”
“Weird.”
“So weird.” Another kiss. “And so, so right.”
EPILOGUE
Greer
“I knew it,” I mutter, watching my cock disappear into Stevie's ass. “You
take me so well, baby girl. Your ass looks so beautiful stretched around
me.”
She whimpers with delight as I push into her, and the sound is music to
my fucking ears.
I love nothing more than the sounds she makes during sex.
“Jacob…” she moans my name. “So good.”
We've been working up to this moment for months. She's been such a
good girl, wearing plugs and letting me stretch her with my tongue and
fingers. Now, she's finally taking my cock, and it's as heavenly as I
suspected it would be.
“God, I love how you feel,” I tell her, palming her cheeks, watching as I
disappear inside her.
She lets out another pleased groan, pushing back and begging for more.
“You want more?”
She nods. “P-Please.”
I land a hard smack to her ass, causing her whole body to shudder with
pleasure.
I do it again.
Pause.
Smack!
Pause.
Smack!
Her ass is red and warm and looks fucking delectable wearing my
handprint.
“Say it again.”
“Please.”
“Please what?”
“Please fuck me, Jacob.”
I lean forward, cupping her throat with my hand and applying the
amount of pressure I know drives her wild and really let loose.
She moans beneath me as I pound into her. The sounds we're making
are carnal and raw, and I love every single minute of it.
“Fuck, baby. You take me so well.”
“Yours,” she mutters. “All yours.”
I slam into her once, twice, three more times, and my orgasm races
through me. I pull out just in time, coating her back, loving the way she
looks covered in my cum.
Mine.
I flip her onto her back, not caring about the mess on my sheets, and
settle into my favorite place—between her legs. She sighs when my tongue
touches her already soaking pussy.
I lick and suck and feast on her until her legs are clamped together like
vise grips around my head, and I have to physically pry them off as she
comes down from her high. Shudders rage through her as I crawl my way
back up her body, slamming my mouth to hers.
I love that she never cares when I kiss her after I've gone down on her.
I love that she lets me use her however I like in bed, never complaining
about it.
But most of all, I love the way she loves me—madly and completely.
I lift her from my bed with ease, carry her into the bathroom, then right
into the shower. I crank the hot water, so glad the water never takes long to
get warm. I pull her under the water when it's ready, letting it crash over us.
I grab her loofah, squirt body wash into it, then hand it her way. I do the
same with mine, dragging the pouf over my body quickly before tossing it
aside to deal with later. My attention is solely on the image in front of me.
It's so stupid and so silly to love watching her shower, but it's my favorite. I
love watching the water rivulets run down her body. Love the soft sighs that
leave her lips when the hot water hits an extra sore spot. I could watch her
forever and never get tired.
I'm happy. Happier than I've ever been in my entire life. It doesn't even
matter that the Comets took yet another first-round exit. I'm still mad about
it, sure, but I know things are going to be okay.
I have Stevie, and I have Macie. It's all I need. They are all I need.
Whenever I'm not on the ice, I've spent almost every waking moment
with them over the last eight months. If I'm not running Macie to school
functions, I'm taking her to hockey practice while Stevie attends night
courses at the local college. If I'm not taking Stevie out on the town for a
romantic night, then we're all curled up on the couch, watching a movie,
and starting pillow fights.
I won't ever tell the guys this, but this team that Stevie and I have built?
I love it more than the Comets.
And if it ever came down to it, I'd pick Stevie over hockey any damn
day.
I want her. Not just now when she's standing naked in front of me. I
want her every day, through the highs and lows. I want it all and more.
“Move in with me.”
She stops her washing, and her mouth drops open, her eyes widening.
She doesn't say anything, and my words hang between us like a thick cloud
of uncertainty.
Finally, I break the silence.
“Is my request really that surprising?”
She lets out a loud laugh. “Yes!”
“What? Why? We've been together for eight months now. I… I thought
we might be on the same page with it.”
“Greer. You just fucked me in the ass, spread your cum all over my
back, then ate me out for ten minutes, and the first thing you say to me is,
move in with me?”
“Oh.” I chuckle. “Fine. I guess my timing wasn't the best.”
“No. No, it really wasn't.”
I press a quick kiss to her nose. “I mean it. I want you girls to move in
with me.”
She clamps her teeth down on her bottom lip, chewing on it. “You do?”
“Of course I do. I love you. I love Macie. We should live together.”
“It's a big step, Greer. It's…” She trails off, nibbling heavily at her lip
still.
I capture her mouth, kissing the spot she was chewing on.
“If you don't want to or feel ready, tell me no, and I promise to listen. I
don't want to pressure you if this isn't what you want.”
“It is what I want,” she tells me.
“Is it Macie? Because I really thought our relationship was getting
better. She likes me now… I think.”
Stevie laughs, then hangs her loofah back on the wall. “Are you kidding
me? She loves you. Sometimes I think more than me.”
“Nah. Not possible.”
She grins. “True.”
“So, then…”
“Then…” She sighs. “Here?”
“Huh?”
“You want us to move in here?”
“Well, yes. No offense, but I can fit three of your apartments in my
kitchen and living room alone. Plus, I have heated floors in here, and you
love those.”
“No offense taken because that's true, and I love the heated bathroom
floors, but… Have you thought about moving somewhere else?”
“I mean, I kind of play hockey here, so…”
She laughs. “I meant, like, maybe moving out of an apartment.”
“Stevie Thomas, are you proposing we buy a house together?”
Her cheeks pinken, and she gives me a slow nod. “Yes. I mean, if you're
ready for that, of course.”
“It's a big step, Stevie. It's…”
She shoves at me when she realizes I'm teasing her, but I grab her
hands, sliding them above her head and lacing my fingers with hers as I
press her back against the cool tile. She shivers, and I'm almost certain it's
not just because of the tile.
“You're mean.” She pouts.
“But you love me.”
“So much.”
“Good, because I really don't want to buy a house with someone who
doesn't love me.”
“Does that mean…”
“Yes, I want to buy a house with you, Stevie.”
“I'd clap right now, but someone's holding me hostage.”
“As if you don't love it,” I say, rolling my hips against hers. A soft sigh
leaves her when my cock brushes against her clit. “You love it when I take
control.”
“So much,” she murmurs.
I plant my lips on her neck, kissing and sucking at the skin as I continue
to rub against her. I love the sounds that leave her as I bring her to the brink
of orgasm.
Even more, I love the groan that leaves her when I back away just as I
think she's about to come.
I laugh darkly.
“Mean.”
“And proud of it.”
“Are you going to be this mean when we live together?”
“Are you kidding? I'm going to be meaner.”
She growls, and I laugh, dragging my cock against her wet pussy once
again.
“You're going to have to learn to be quiet, you know.”
“Hey, I think I've proved I can be quiet.”
“Sure. Now. But what happens when I'm meaner…rougher. Can you be
quiet then?”
“I guess we'll just have to see, won't we?”
“Or—and hear me out here—we could build a nice, pretty little
soundproof room, and I can use it to do anything I want to you.”
Her skin ignites with goose bumps as a shudder runs through her.
I grin. “You like that idea?”
She nods. “Very much so. We're going to need a hot tub too.”
“A hot tub?”
“Yeah, I've always wanted to have sex in a hot tub.”
I laugh. “Fine. We'll get you a hot tub.”
“And—”
“Steve?”
“Yes?” she mutters, so lost in me rubbing against her that she doesn't
even realize I've just called her Steve.
“Would you rather we just build a house?”
Her eyes fly open. “Are you nuts?”
“Possibly. But if we build, we could get everything we want.”
“But your contracts… What happens if you move? I—”
“Then we'll figure it out later.”
“Are we going to stay together if you move teams?”
“Do you want to stay together if I move teams?”
“I…” She runs her tongue over her bottom lip. “Is it going to freak you
out if I say yes?”
“Not a chance. In fact, I want you to say yes.”
“You do?”
“Of course I do. In case you haven't realized it yet, Stevie, I'm kind of
crazy about you.”
“Is that so?”
“That's so. I am madly and completely in love with you.”
She sighs. “Good. Because I'm kind of crazy about you too.”
“Yeah?”
“Madly and completely, Jacob.”
Then I kiss her, and I don't stop until we're both trembling under the
cold water.
After that, I start all over again.
If I never win another hockey game, I'll be okay.
I already played the best game ever…and won.
BONUS EPILOGUE
Stevie
I never in my life thought I'd be where I am now, standing on a stage and
ready to accept my diploma.
When Greer suggested I go back to school, I thought he was nuts. I had
a job, a kid, and a life. I didn't have the time to go back to school to figure
out what I wanted to do. But he promised he would help and take care of
everything I couldn't. And somehow, even with his crazy schedule, he did.
There isn't a single doubt in my mind that he's the reason I'm walking
across this stage right now.
“Congratulations,” the dean says, shaking my hand.
“Thank you,” I mutter, already feeling my cheeks get hot under all the
attention.
Greer and Macie yell from across the auditorium, but they aren't even
the loudest. It's all the other Comets players making noise that really sticks
out to me.
Aside from Smith and Emilia, since they left the Comets last year,
everyone else is here making a huge ruckus, including my dad and his
fiancé, Ernesto, Loretta and David, and I've never felt more loved or
supported in my life.
It's fantastic, this little family we've seemed to build here. I have people
I can count on and friends I know I'll have for life.
Greer signed another contract a few months ago, which means we're
staying. I'm thankful, too. Macie is making some incredible strides with her
hockey team, and I know she doesn't want to leave them behind. And
selfishly, I didn't want to leave the beautiful home we built, which I still
can't believe we live in.
We've come so far since Greer first asked me to be his date, and I'm
terrified that one day I'll wake up, and it'll be just a really, really good
dream.
I don't want that. I want this forever.
I want Greer forever.
I make my way back to my seat, taking in the last of the ceremony with
an impatience I've never known before. I want so badly to just run to the
people who matter most in my life and skip all these speeches that I have
heard a thousand times before.
When it's finally over, we do the typical graduation thing and toss our
caps into the air, then we're free.
I don't waste a single second and run to find Macie and Greer at our
designated meeting spot.
I slow down when I see them, taking in the view in front of me: Macie
and Greer, standing together and laughing at something, each of them
holding a giant bouquet of flowers.
They look so much at ease together, a stark difference from the first few
interactions together. Macie no longer calls him The Jackass. Instead, she
calls him Jacob.
I didn't tell Greer this, but just last week, she asked me if he's going to
be her dad, and if he does become her dad, can she call him that.
I cried for a half hour afterward.
Her question was so sweet and innocent, mostly because she has no idea
how Greer feels about marriage. Do I want to get married again? If it's
Greer asking, then yes. In a heartbeat. But I know the idea of marriage isn't
something he's too crazy about, and I respect that.
“Mom!” Macie races down the hall, her arms outstretched as she runs
toward me.
I crouch just in time to scoop her into my arms, hugging her tightly.
She's getting so big, and soon, I know she's not going to let me hug her like
this in public, so I'm going to soak it all up while I can.
“I'm so proud of you!” she says, and the tears leap to my eyes in an
instant. “You did it!”
“I did. I did it.”
She pulls away. “Greer said you could. He said that even when you
thought you couldn't, he believed enough for both of you that you could do
it.”
I look up at the man who has meandered down the hall our way. He's
grinning brightly down at me.
I rise to my feet and barely stand before he throws his arms around me,
dragging me into his warmth. I sigh when his familiar scent washes over me
and sag into him.
“You're incredible, Stevie.”
“Only because I know I have you there to help me when I fall.”
“Please,” he says, pulling back to cup my face in his hands. “You were
incredible long before I met you.”
When he says it, it makes me believe it's true.
I give him a small smile, which is covered when his lips touch mine.
It's a soft kiss. A chaste one too. But it doesn't stop Macie from
complaining.
“Are you guys going to kiss all day, or are we getting ice cream?”
I laugh, pulling away from Greer. “Ice cream.”
“Yes!” She pumps her fists in the air. “I'll even let you ride shotgun in
the fun car.”
“Then where are you going to ride?”
“We can take her,” my sister says as she approaches. She spreads her
arms wide. “Steve…”
I fall into her embrace, hugging her tightly.
“Congratulations, big sis.”
“Thanks.” I squeeze her tightly before letting go. “You're the best little
sister, you know that, right?”
“I know.” She shrugs, then winks at me.
I'm passed around to everyone, giving them all hugs.
By the time we're finished, I'm a blubbering mess, feeling like a fool.
“This is your fault, you know,” I tell Greer.
“How so?”
“You gave me this big family, and they've made me cry, so it's your
fault.”
“Well, don't dry your eyes just yet. I have something else that might
make you cry.”
I tip my head, brows crushed together. “Okay…”
“Do you want to get married?”
His words have me staggering back. “Excuse me?”
“I was wondering if you wanted to get married.”
I look around at the group surrounding us. All eyes are on us right now,
and I'm not sure what the hell is going on. Why is he asking me this here?
Now?
“To…you? Or just in general?”
“Well, I'd prefer if it was to me, but I guess in general is fine too.”
“Are you…” I can't even get the words out. They're stuck in my throat
like I've swallowed a rock.
“I am.”
“Greer…”
“Steve…”
He chuckles lightly, though it's not his usual laugh. It's a bit stilted and
quiet. I realize for the first time that Greer's nervous. He's never nervous.
That means…
“I'm asking you to marry me, Stevie.”
“She probably can't tell because you're just standing there like an
idiot,” Miller says, causing everyone to laugh.
Greer sighs, then drops down to one knee. “Stevie Thomas, I love you
more than anything in this world.”
Macie gasps. “More than hockey?”
“More than hockey,” Greer confirms.
“More than me?”
“Shit.”
He clears his throat, then peers back up at me.
“Stevie Thomas, I love you and Macie more than anything in this
world.” I grin at his correction. “I know I've been against marriage in the
past, but that's because I didn't realize what I was missing. You. Macie,
too,” he says, looking over at the kid in question. She shoots him a thumbsup. “But now that I know what I could have, I want more. I want you. Both
of you. Forever. I want to be your husband, and I want to be Macie's dad.”
Someone gasps, and someone else sniffles, but I have no clue who
makes either sound. My sole focus is on Greer.
I can't believe this is happening. I can't believe this is happening now,
with all of my friends and family surrounding me.
I can't believe that this man…this incredible, amazing man…wants to
marry me.
“You can still be my dad, even if she says no,” Macie whispers in a
voice that's not so quiet, and her words melt my heart.
“No.”
“No?” Greer says.
“No?” Macie echoes.
“I mean, no, that's not necessary.”
“So, you're saying…” Greer trails off.
“Yes!” I yell, not caring that we're in the middle of a crowded hallway.
“Yes, yes, yes!”
“Are you sure you mean it? I can't tell.”
“Yes,” I say more quietly this time.
“Really?”
“Please don't make me say it again.”
Greer shoves to his feet, then wraps his arms around me, slamming his
mouth against mine without hesitation.
This kiss is a lot different than the one before. It's not as soft or as
chaste. Instead, it's full of love and the guarantee of forever.
When he finally pulls his lips from mine, he trails his kisses up my
cheek to my ear.
“I plan to make you say yes every damn chance I get.”
I shiver at the promise.
“Her ring, her ring!”
Greer steps aside, and I'm shocked as hell to see Macie holding her
palm up to me, a beautiful gold ring sitting in the center.
“You knew?” I ask her.
She nods. “Yep. He asked for my permission last week.”
“So that's why you were wondering if you could call him Dad?”
Macie nods, her eyes drifting from me to Greer, who is looking down at
her with tears welling in his eyes.
“Is that what you want?” he asks her softly, and she nods again. “Yes.
Yes, you can call me that.”
Greer drops to his knees and pulls Macie into a hug. She holds him just
as tightly, and my heart leaps into my throat as I watch them together. It's
everything I ever wanted for her with the guy I never expected.
This might just be my favorite moment ever.
When they finally part, I don't miss Greer swiping at his eyes or the
redness to Macie's.
They both sniffle and look anywhere than at each other.
Greer grabs my hand, then slides the ring over my finger.
“It's a perfect fit,” I mutter.
“I'm just that good.”
He winks at me, and I roll my eyes.
“You're annoying,” I tell him.
“I know. But now I get to annoy you forever.” He presses a soft kiss to
my lips. “I love you, Stevie.”
“I love you more, Greer.”
“And I love you both. Now can we puh-lease get some ice cream?”
We all laugh at Macie's impatience.
As we head out of the school, the whole big group of us, all I can think
is: This is it. This is forever.
I'll never take any of this for granted.

FITZ
“Here! Here!” I tap my stick against the ice, begging for the pass.
The defenseman slides the puck my way from behind the net, and I take
off at full speed, keeping my head up and making sure I'm in the clear.
“Wheels, wheels, wheels!” someone yells from the bench. I'm not sure
who it is, maybe Greer? He's not in the net tonight, but I know he's sitting
there watching the game with sharp eyes. Either way, I listen, charging up
the ice, spinning around one LA player, then another. I lock eyes with the
goalie as I let the puck fly off the toe of my blade.
All twenty thousand people in the sold-out arena explode in cheers
when it hits the back of the net.
“FUCK YES!” I shout as the rest of the Comets empty the bench,
crowding around me, knocking my helmet with their own, and shoving at
me.
“Now, that's an OT win, baby!” Rhodes says, tapping his bucket against
mine.
“That was all you,” I tell him as Wright, another defenseman, grabs me
and gives me an excited shake.
Rhodes gives me a look like I'm full of shit, but I'm not. If he hadn't
read that pass the way he did, I wouldn't have been able to take off like that.
He set it up, and I followed through on it.
The team bumps heads with the goalie, a tradition we have when we
win, then we make our way off the ice, feeding off the cheers from the
home crowd. I barely hold back a groan when I'm stopped in the tunnel and
told to get my smile ready. I'm about to be bombarded by the media; I
know it.
“Tonight's first star of the game, with the game-winning overtime goal,
is Ivan FIIIIIIITZGERALD!”
I hop onto the ice, skate a few quick circles, and toss the t-shirt in my
hands into the crowd before taking a seat next to our commentator, J.P.
“Heck of a game there, Ivan! How does it feel to have the overtime
winner?”
I grin. “Good. Really good.”
“I heard you tap your stick for Beast to pass the puck to you. You saw
that opening from a mile away, didn't ya, big guy?”
I did. I saw it playing out in my head before I begged for the puck, but I
can't tell him that. I'll come off as too cocky, and that's not who I am,
especially not in front of the cameras.
“I saw something that might work, so I took the shot.”
“Good shot, too.” He laughs. “Well, we'll let you get going, go
celebrate with the guys. Thanks for taking the time to talk, and hey, thanks
for that winning goal. Congrats on a great game, Fitzy.”
“Yeah, thanks, J.P.”
I shake his hand, give the still-roaring crowd another wave, and then
head down the tunnel to the locker room, more than ready to hit the showers
and go home for the night. We have tomorrow off before we continue our
three-game homestand, and I'm looking forward to it.
“A couple of us are hitting up Slapshots. You game?” Hayes asks as
soon as I walk into the dressing room.
“Nah, man. I'm going to head home.” I yank my sweater over my head
and toss it into the laundry bin, then drop down into my cubby.
“You sure? Guaranteed to find some willing pussy there.” He lifts his
dark brows up and down.
“Don't talk about women like that, idiot.” Miller, a forward with some
hot hands, slaps Hayes across the back of his head as he walks by.
I can't help but laugh because I'm pretty sure Miller was Hayes at one
point before he settled down with Scout, the donut truck owner turned
romance novelist. Now, he's wrapped around her finger and follows her like
a lost puppy.
Looking at Hayes, I point at Miller. “For the record, I'm with him.”
“You are?” Miller asks, his mouth ajar. He snaps it shut quickly, then
puffs his chest out. “I mean, yeah—of course I'm right and you agree with
me.”
I do my best to hide my laugh.
Hayes lifts his eyes skyward. “Fine. We're guaranteed to find some
ladies who would love to be ravaged.”
I shake my head. “While that's slightly better, no, thank you.”
“You're no fun,” Hayes complains, but thankfully, he drops it.
I don't feel like explaining that I don't want to go out because I hate
going out. It's not my scene, and it never will be my scene. The few times
I've been out with the guys haven't really been my idea. I only did it for
team bonding and shit when I was first brought on. In fact, the last time I
went to Slapshots was with Greer and Hayes, and that night ended up
changing the direction of Greer's life.
That's not something I'm looking for now.
I'm content with what I have—hockey, hockey, and more hockey. It's
all I've ever needed to be happy. It's not that I don't want to settle down
someday; I don't hate the idea like some guys, but I'm not actively pursuing
it either. If it happens, it happens, but for now, I'm happy playing the best
game ever to exist and getting paid damn well to do it.
And none of that has anything to do with the fact that I'm horrible at
putting myself out there. No. That's not it at all. I just like being alone.
“Fitz! Media!” Coach Heller yells, and I try to keep my eyes from
rolling.
I hate talking to the media. They all ask the same questions, forcing me
to give the same answers creatively. They must get together and coordinate
this attack on players. There's no way they don't.
I finish stripping off all my gear, then toss on a pair of shorts and a navy
Comets t-shirt before heading off to fulfill my duty. As I predicted, it's a
bunch of the same old bullshit.
“How did it feel to get the overtime winner?” Just terrible. I hate
winning.
“What about that pass from Rhodes? Incredible, huh? Did you practice
that?” No. Not at all. We never practice. It's purely natural talent.
“You guys struggled a bit during the second period. Any reason for
that?” Because we sucked. No real reason other than simply playing bad
hockey when we should have been playing hockier hockey than the other
team.
While those aren't the answers I give, they're the ones screaming
loudest in my head.
“Fuck, this shit is hard sometimes,” I mutter as I head back to the locker
room, feeling completely exhausted after being forced in front of the
camera. Sure, it was probably only five whole minutes of my life, but it felt
like years. I am not cut out for this part of playing professional sports, that's
for damn sure.
“I fucking feel that,” Rhodes says as he slings his bag over his shoulder.
“I'm pretty sure I'm getting fined for my interview.”
I laugh. “Did you shove the microphones out of your face again?”
“You're damn right I did. I could smell the spit on one.” He wrinkles his
nose. “And tobacco. I hate when they do that. It's bullshit.”
It really is.
“I might have also given them an earful of my opinion on that crap call
in the second. But, hey, they asked.”
I shake my head. “They'll never learn.”
“Nope. Sure won't.” He claps me on the shoulder. “I'm heading home
to the wife. Great game out there tonight. Later, man.”
“Yeah, later,” I say as he walks out of the room.
There are a few stragglers, a couple of guys I'm not close with, so I
finish stuffing my bag and hit the road too. I manage to make it to my old
1971 forest green Chevy truck without being bothered again—a miracle,
really—and the first thing I do is stop at Smoothie Town for my late-night
strawberry fix. It's a little tradition of mine after home games. Win or lose, I
get a smoothie for the drive home.
I shove the truck into park and check my phone for the first time since
before the game. I'm unsurprised to find a few texts waiting for me.
Mom: MY BABY BOY!
Mom: Before you yell at me, I know you're not a baby, but
you'll always be MY baby.
Mom: I'm so proud of you, son. I love you. Call in the morning,
okay?
If you looked up “hockey mom” in the dictionary, the name Anya Fitzgerald
would be right next to it because that's exactly what my mother is—a
hockey mom through and through. She's been my biggest cheerleader since
I first stepped foot on the ice, and that dedication has never waned. Hell,
she's more into my hockey career than my father, and I think it strengthens
our bond.
Don't get me wrong—my dad loves and supports the hell out of me, but
football is where his heart lies; he even coaches it at the college level. So,
while he appreciates that I'm an athlete and greatly respects my work ethic,
he doesn't understand why I couldn't put that devotion toward football
rather than hockey. It was always a sore subject between us, and my mother
was excited to get a break from all things football and focus on something
else.
So, yeah, I fully expected to be hearing from her after that game.
I shoot her a few texts, a grin on my face as I type.
Me: I promise to call first thing in the AM.
Me: Well, maybe not the FIRST thing. Time difference and all
that.
Me: And I'll always be your baby boy…just don't tell any of the
guys I said that. Deal? I love you, too.
Satisfied, I turn off my truck and hop out, heading toward one of my
favorite things about playing home games.
“Hey, Fitz. That was a great goal tonight,” Dirk, the kid behind the
window, says when I walk up.
“Thanks, man. It was all Rhodes, though.”
“Really? Because I didn't see it go off his stick into the net. Pretty sure
that was all you.”
My cheeks grow hot under the attention, and I clear my throat. “Can
I—”
“Get a twenty-ounce strawberry smoothie?”
I chuckle. “That predictable?”
He shrugs. “I prefer to call you a regular instead of predictable.”
“I appreciate that.”
He's full of shit, though. I am predictable. I know it, and he does too.
Hell, even my teammates know it. The only place I'm not predictable is on
the ice, which I suppose is good because I keep the goalies on their toes.
Outside of the rink, though, everything about me is consistent. I get up
at five every morning, go for a quick three-mile jog, then head back to my
apartment for the same breakfast I have every day: oatmeal mixed with
strawberries and a slice of toast topped with peanut butter and even more
strawberries because my strawberry obsession is alive and well.
After breakfast, I set my coffee to brew and hit the shower while the
machine does its thing. After that, I do what I do every other day—hockey.
It takes over my whole afternoon and evening during the season and,
truthfully, the rest of the year too.
My life is pretty boring, except for that one thing I don't ever talk about
with anyone.
“Here you go,” Dirk says, pulling me from my own head as he slides
my drink across the counter. The kid shakes his head at me when I try to
hand over my card. “On me. My way of saying thanks for getting those two
points for us.”
Points we needed, especially after starting our season with a three-game
losing streak. We were still reeling from losing in the Playoffs after Greer's
injury kept him out of the lineup, so we tanked our first three games. We're
already in an uphill battle, and the season has just begun.
“Thanks, Dirk. Have a good night.” I slip a fifty-dollar bill into his tip
cup, returning to my truck before he can complain.
I swing myself up and into the driver's seat, then head home. It's a
quick five-minute drive, and I'm parking my big beast before I know it. I
wave to the doorman as I hustle past him to the elevators. I hit sixteen and
sip on my drink as the car takes me up.
I grin when the elevator doors open because I can hear her from here.
I unlock my door and push it open just wide enough for me to shimmy
through, moving quickly so she can't slip out. She's done that too many
times for my liking, especially with Miss Drake living down the hall and
feeding her too many treats any chance she gets. I got a reaming from the
vet last time I took her in, and I'm not looking for a repeat of that.
“Hey, Carl,” I say, scooping the fluffy brown and white cat into my
arms. “How was your night?”
Meow.
“That good, huh?” I scratch under her chin. “You hungry?”
Meow.
“Come on, let's get you something.”
I let her leap down to the floor, then make my way to my kitchen,
pulling her food out from her designated cabinet and filling her bowl with a
small scoop. I add a little treat on top just because I can. Carl rubs against
my legs as a thank-you, then dives right into her second dinner like I didn't
leave her a first one before I left.
Carl does her thing, and I make my way to my bedroom, stripping out
of my clothes. It's been a long day, and I'm more than ready to relax. I pull
on a pair of sweatpants, skipping a t-shirt, then pad back to the poorly
decorated spare bedroom I use as my office, where I flop down into my
desk chair. I don't even bother pretending I'm going to do anything
productive. I know exactly what I'm sitting here for.
Her.
I shake the mouse to wake up my computer, then navigate to my
favorite streaming site. As I expected, she's already on.
RoPlaying is online. Would you like to watch?
Not join. Watch.
Because that's what I like to do—I enjoy watching.
I didn't realize it's something I'm into until a few years ago when I was
more into watching the woman I was seeing than I was into actually having
sex with her. It's not that I don't enjoy sex, because I definitely do, but just
sitting back and watching is perfectly fine by me. The sounds, the lighting,
the outfits…it does more for me than the actual act of having sex. It's not
just about the physical aspect of it; it's everything.
I asked her one night if I could just watch, and she allowed it. She
thought it was weird but agreed. I asked her to go to a bar and flirt with
another guy, told her I'd sit in the corner and let it play out. Again, weird for
her, but she did it. We had some great sex that night, but when I asked her if
I could sit outside her house while she had the curtains drawn open and
watch…well, it crossed the line for her. She informed me I was a pervert
and the only reason she was dating a “toothless loser” like me was because
I played pro hockey.
After that, I backed off the dating scene. I didn't want this newfound
thing of mine to get out, especially not to the media. The last thing I needed
was a headline calling me a Peeping Tom.
It's been me, my hand, and porn sites since. That's how I found this
particular stream I can't seem to get enough of, by surfing the web. I
figured I like to watch, so what better way than watching a cam girl?
I click join, then settle into my chair as her image fills the screen.
As usual, she's wearing a mask. It's a black and gold Venetian style that
doesn't cover her entire face, but it's enough to hide her real identity. She
has on heavy makeup that makes her green eyes extra bright and a light
pink wig that ensures she could walk down the street next to you and you'd
have no clue you're standing beside her.
She keeps her voice low as she talks about her day, all while painting
her toenails. She's fully clothed but wearing lingerie that doesn't leave a
whole lot to the imagination, especially not with her legs bent and the
bottoms of the tiny shorts she's wearing flirting with flashing the parts of
her I'm dying to see.
That's all she's doing—painting her toes and talking.
And I'm absolutely fucking addicted to it.
I have no idea why. I'm not sure if it means there's something wrong
with me that I find this so damn hot, but I do. I love every minute of it, and
my cock is already beginning to swell behind my sweats.
It's been two months since I found her channel, and it took me all of one
night to get hooked on it. Now, if I miss a stream, I feel off. It's sad, I know,
but here we are anyway.
Watching her isn't why I didn't want to go to Slapshots tonight. Okay,
so watching her is part of it, but no matter what, I still would have told
Hayes no, not only because I'd rather be sitting right here but because I
don't have any interest in hitting up a bar. I have no desire to pretend to be
one of the guys who only worry about getting laid. I'm happy staying home
and doing my own thing. I learned long ago I don't crave the attention some
other guys on the team do.
My gaze is pulled back to the screen when she jostles around, and I
don't miss how her tits spill out of her top even more. She's wearing a black
bra that barely covers anything, showing that she's well aware of who her
audience is and what they're there for…myself included, as much as I hate
to admit it.
I press against my cock that's now hard as a rock, trying to relieve some
of the growing ache. I promised myself when I started tuning in for this that
I would never, ever touch myself while I watch, and so far, I've kept that
promise.
I should feel ashamed for doing this, for watching her and enjoying it so
much, but she wouldn't be on this camera if she didn't want people
watching, right?
At least that's what I tell myself to feel better.
She dips her brush back into the bottle—a deep orange—and her tongue
pokes out of the corner of her mouth as she concentrates on what she's
doing. After she's done with her toes, she moves to her hands, and I watch
diligently as she paints each one twice.
That's the weirdest part of all of this. She doesn't talk much, but it
doesn't make watching her any less appealing. It should, but it doesn't. I'm
still here, showing up nearly nightly even though there's never much said
other than a few low sighs. Sometimes she'll talk about her day, like
tonight, but others she's silent. It doesn't make it any less thrilling to watch
her.
It's pathetic.
I'm pathetic. I gave up a night out with my teammates to watch
someone online do the most mundane things.
“And done,” she says softly in that raspy voice of hers. She looks down
at the task she's completed and smiles, then shimmies her hips, making her
tits jiggle once more. I watch with rapt attention like the pervert I am.
My eyes drift over to the button that's been taunting me for months
now.
Request Private Video.
I want to click it. I want to click it so fucking badly my hands actually
tingle with need.
But I don't. I never do. That's crossing a line I can't uncross.
I try not to think about the times she's accepted that request from other
people, the things she could be doing in those chats. I want to pretend she
doesn't, want to pretend it's just me and her and nobody else is watching.
She looks over at the clock that's hanging on the wall of the background
that's one of her favorites to use and sinks her teeth into her bottom lip
when she looks back at the camera.
Oh yeah. She totally knows what she's doing.
“It's getting late,” she says in a husky whisper. “I have an early
morning. Thanks for tuning in this evening.”
Her eyes move to the camera, and it feels like she's staring into my soul.
Like it's just us in this room. Like there aren't other people watching her.
Some nights, like tonight, she'll have her comments turned on, and her
eyes flit over them as they roll in. Nearly all are respectful, but some make
me want to reach through the screen and punch whoever is on the other
side.
So, I do what I always do at the end of every stream I watch. I sit
forward, hands on my keyboard, and I write her a message.
ShootsAndScores: I'm glad you chose orange. It's my favorite color. Hope
your day was amazing, Ro.
A slight smile plays on her lips as she reads over the messages, and I tell
myself it's because of mine, though I highly doubt that.
“Good night,” she says.
When she covers the camera with her hand and the screen goes black, I
pretend her words were just for me.
“Good night, Rosie,” I reply.

ROSIE
“Son of a…”
I glower down at the mess all over the floor of the donut truck I've
practically been running on my own for the last six months or so. This isn't
the first time I've dropped a container of sprinkles and I'm sure it won't be
the last, but this whole situation would be much better if I hadn't dropped
an entire pitcher of cold brew too.
Why did I think grabbing ten things from the fridge at once was a good
idea? Oh, right—because I'm running behind on getting ready to open and
doing several things at once is completely necessary because if I don't,
there is no way I will get this truck open on time, and Scout will kill me if
that happens.
Setting my hands on my hips, I close my eyes, suck in a deep breath,
and then exhale.
In. Out.
In. Out.
Breathe, Rosie. You've got this. You're off your game today, but you can
fix this.
When my heart rate finds a natural rhythm and I don't feel like the next
thing out of my mouth will be a curse word, I peel my eyes open, then get
to work cleaning up the mess I made.
It's a Monday morning, and by morning, I mean morning. It's currently
4:45 AM, I'm supposed to open at six, and I still have about ten things on
my to-do list. Big things. Important-to-running-this-truck kind of things. I
mean, it's Monday, for crying out loud. There is no way we won't have a
line forming five minutes before we open, and there's no way it will not be
stretched out to the parking lot at one point.
This place is a hotspot for the players of the Carolina Comets, our local
NHL team. I guarantee at least half the team will roll through here like they
do nearly every morning. The last thing I want to do is upset Scout by
making their experience here bad. They bring in big crowds, and if they
think this place has gone to the crapper…well, it won't be good, that's for
sure.
“I'm screwed,” I mutter to nobody else but myself since I'm the only
one here for another fifteen minutes at least.
Stevie, the older sister of the truck's owner, should be here soon to help
prep for the day. She usually comes in before she drops her daughter off at
school, then pops back in for the lunch rush we always seem to have. Who
knew donuts and coffee would be such a hit at noon?
I let out a big yawn as I towel up the rest of the sprinkles-and-coffee
mess, then dump the soaking wet rag into the wash bin.
“Real rude of you,” I say to the now-cracked coffee pitcher as I pick it
up off the counter. “I was really looking forward to you this morning.”
I'm running on about four hours of sleep, so the beautiful pitcher of
jitter juice was just what I needed to add a pep to my step, but that's not
happening now.
“Guess I'll have to settle for hot coffee.” I sneer at the pot that's
currently being filled. “You're gross, but you'll do.”
“Are you talking to yourself again?”
I spin around to find Stevie walking in through the door at the other end
of the truck. Her dark brown hair is pulled into a high, sleek bun, and she's
dressed in cute jeans and a form-fitting long-sleeve green sweater.
I look like a damn trash goblin standing next to her. My blonde hair is
tied up in a messy bun, and I'm pretty sure the clothes I'm wearing—a pair
of jeans and a simple long-sleeve striped shirt—are the same ones I wore
two days ago. I didn't even have the chance to swipe on some mascara this
morning or do anything to my eyebrows.
I'm a wreck.
And an uncaffeinated wreck at that.
“You're early,” I say by way of greeting.
She lifts a shoulder. “Greer woke me up early when he went out for his
run, so I figured I'd get a jump on the day. He's going to take Macie to
school for me since she doesn't like riding in my ‘lame' SUV.”
I wrinkle my nose. “Running is so gross.”
I've never understood why people find it enjoyable, but to each their
own. I'd much rather get my activity in by doing something more exciting
like rollerblading or playing volleyball on a beach. Oh man, the beach
sounds really nice right about now. Well, maybe not now now because it's
October, but still.
“Right? It should be outlawed unless you're running from Michael
Myers or something. Then I'll allow it.”
“You'd run away from him? I'd run to him.”
“But he's a total psycho killer, Rosie—why would you run to him?”
“A psycho killer, sure, but in a hot way. He's just misunderstood.”
Stevie laughs. “You really need to stay away from Harper. You two
together would be dangerous in the same room.”
Harper, the wife of one of the many Carolina Comets players who
frequent Scout's Sweets, is known for being obsessed with all things horror.
She loves it so much she's built a successful business making props for
horror movies and creepy dolls.
Hmm. Maybe I can get her to make me something for my streaming
setup.
“So, what's going on here?” Stevie's eyes wander around the chaotic
state the place is currently in.
“I dropped the sprinkles.”
She grimaces. “Oh no.”
“Oh yes. It was extra unfortunate because I also dropped the cold brew.”
I gesture to the busted pitcher. “It's broken.”
“Oh no,” Stevie mutters again. “We open in…”
“Less than an hour? I know.” I exhale heavily, then give myself a shake.
“Okay, here's what's happening: you're going to the store and grabbing
sprinkles. We need a mix of red, white, and blue, the biggest tub you can
find. Hell, grab two. Then we need four things of cold brew, unsweetened,
dark roast. And of course, another pitcher. But it has to be the forty-eightounce one or it's not going to work.” I clap my hands together. “Annnd go!”
Stevie doesn't move. She just stands there, brows raised. That's when I
realize…
“Oh god. You're the boss' sister, so you're basically my boss and I
totally just overstepped. I—”
Stevie's laugh cuts off my words, and she waves her hand. “No, it's not
that. It's just you remind me so much of Scout, taking charge and kicking
ass. I love it. No wonder she trusts you with her baby so much.”
Phew. “Thank you. Truly. I promise I'll have everything cleaned up and
ready to go before you get back.”
“Oh, I know you will, you little badass.” She throws me a wink, then
grabs her purse off the hook and pulls it over her shoulder.
“Has anyone told you lately how amazing you are?”
A saccharine smile curves her lips, and her eyes glaze over like she's
remembering someone saying that very thing only recently. “Only Greer.”
I want to be annoyed by her answer. I want to think, Ew, gross. Stop
being so in love.
But I can't find it in me, not after everything Stevie's been through, not
just in her life but with Greer, the goalie for the Carolina Comets who she
started dating earlier this year. They deserve each other, and more than that,
they deserve to be happy.
I wish I had that too.
“I still can't believe you're together.”
She laughs. “You're telling me. Especially since I swore I hated him.”
“You hated how hot he made you, maybe, but you never hated him.”
Her cheeks pinken. “Hush or I'll send you to run errands, and I'll
inevitably mess up the morning prep. Then, when Scout is freaking out
about all the one-star reviews we'll get bombed with, I'll tell her it's all
your fault.”
I gasp. “You'd never!”
She lifts a perfectly shaped brow. “Want to bet?”
She wouldn't, not really—but that doesn't mean it doesn't scare me.
“Fine.” I mimic zipping my lips and throwing away the key.
Stevie chuckles. “Smart move. I'll be back in a bit. Try not to break
anything else, and text me if you do!”
I gasp. “Too soon, Stevie! Too soon!”
She laughs her way out of the truck, jogging toward her car parked at
the back of the lot next to mine, and I begin prepping the one thing
everyone will be lining up for—donuts. I knead the dough, then move on to
forming the donuts. Having done this for the last however many mornings, I
move quickly, blazing through my to-make list like it's nothing.
I glance at the clock: roughly twenty minutes to go until we open.
“I got this. I can do this.”
A throat clears behind me, and I nearly drop another container of
sprinkles at the sudden intrusion.
When I see who it is, I narrow my eyes. “What the hell is wrong with
you, just sneaking up on people like that? I could have had a heart attack,
and then I'd be really pissed.”
“You'd probably also be dead, so would there really be anything to be
mad about?”
“Yes!”
He grins at my answer. “Morning, Rosie.” That soft, velvety-smooth
voice of his slides over me, tickling in all the best places.
I swear I feel my knees start to buckle, and I catch myself from falling
at the last second. I've already had a bad morning; I'd rather not add to that
by making a complete fool of myself in front of one of the star forwards on
the Carolina Comets.
“How's it going?” he asks.
“Fine,” I tell him, even though this morning has been anything but fine.
“We'll be ready to open in a few minutes.”
“No problem. I know I'm a bit early, and I'm in no rush. I'm early for
everything today.”
I nod. “Stevie ran out to grab some coffee and sprinkles. We're out. I
dropped them. I dropped the sprinkles all over the floor and made a mess,
and then I dropped coffee on top of it and broke the pitcher, and I—”
Am rambling. I'm rambling like a damn fool in front of Ivan fucking
Fitzgerald, a professional hockey player who is by far the most attractive
man I've ever seen in person. And on my television screen, because, yes, I
do watch all of his games.
Man, I really wish I'd gone to sleep earlier last night. I truly am a mess
today because rambling is so not me. Well, not anymore.
“Rough morning, then?” Fitz asks.
I huff out a contrived laugh. “You could say that.”
“I know how you feel. I'm that guy who always wakes up at five AM on
the dot, and this morning, I was up at four thirty like some psycho, and I'm
ninety percent sure I stepped in gum on my way here.” He scrapes his shoe
against the gravel like he's still trying to get it off.
“I was up at four thirty.”
I would have been up at four if my alarm had gone off. Apparently, that
extra half hour really does make a difference for my sanity.
His cheeks turn a deep shade of red. “I…I didn't mean…”
I wave him off. “I'm kidding. I mean, not about being up because I
totally was, but I'm just playing with you. If I weren't getting up for work
at that hour, I'd also think getting up at four thirty is for psychos.”
“It should be outlawed.”
“Like running.”
He tips his head to the side, that run-your-fingers-through-it-worthy
brown hair falling over with the movement. “Running should be outlawed?”
“Unless that hottie with the babysitter obsession is chasing you, then
yes.”
He mouths babysitter obsession like he's trying to figure out what I'm
going on about. He shakes his head. “I was just running, and not because I
was being chased.”
“So, you got up, got dressed, and decided to go for a run?”
“Three miles.”
“Three miles?! Like, on purpose?”
He laughs. “On purpose every day.”
“Even Sundays?”
“Even Sundays.”
I clutch my chest and gasp. “Sundays are meant for being lazy! That's,
like, a rule!”
He points at his chest. “Hockey player in the middle of hockey season.”
“So you don't run during the offseason?”
The color on his cheeks deepens again. “Well, yes, I still run then too.”
“So you're just a psycho year-round?”
“Yeah, I guess so.”
I shake my head. “I always knew there was a secret naughty streak
behind your cute toothless smile.”
The second the words leave my mouth, I realize what I've done. I
smack my hand against my traitorous lips, eyes wide with fear as what I
said registers for Fitz.
His usually bright and cheerful hazel eyes darken a smidge, and that
grin on his lips falters slightly. His cheeks turn a deep red.
I've embarrassed him.
Hell, I've embarrassed me.
I'm an idiot. A complete dumbass.
Why would I say that? Why? This is Fitz. Fitz! He comes here damn
near daily. I have to see him all. The. Time. Why did I have to go and make
things completely awkward between us by saying he's cute? And using the
word naughty?
What. Is. Wrong. With. Me.
The worst part? I can't take it back, because that would make me look
even worse. Complimenting him and then walking back the compliment?
No. That's tacky.
God, I need more sleep.
Fitz clears his throat, and I rush to say something—anything—before he
can call me out on what a complete dumbass I am.
“Coffee will be a minute. You can wait over there.” I point to the picnic
benches.
Fitz peeks over his shoulder to where my finger indicates, then looks
back at me. His brows are raised, and his lips are rolled tightly together like
he's barely holding back whatever is sitting on the tip of his tongue.
But, to my complete shock, he doesn't say anything. Instead, he spins
on his heel and heads for an empty bench, sliding onto it, folding his hands
on the table, and just…sitting there. He doesn't pull his phone from his
pocket and play on it or try to talk to me.
He just…sits. It's weird and comforting all at the same time.
And like the well-mannered and not-at-all-awkward human I am, I turn
my back to him and get back to work, pretending he isn't even there.
Though that's impossible because he is here.
He's here, and I can feel his eyes on me, can feel his hazel stare boring
into me as he rakes his gaze over my body while I finish prepping the
donuts for the morning rush. It makes it hard to focus on the task at hand,
especially when I can't stop thinking about what I said to him.
“I always knew there was a secret naughty streak behind your cute
toothless smile.”
Who says that?!
And who then sends the person away?
I'm horrible at customer service. Horrible! Scout should fire me. I don't
deserve to work here.
“You're being dramatic, Rosie,” I mutter to myself. “It's not a big deal.
Fitz knows you didn't mean anything by it. It's fine. You're fine.”
But I'm not fine. I'm anything but fine. I'm a sleepy mess who just
made things awkward with a pro hockey player.
“Um, Rosie?” I turn to find Stevie walking into the food truck, several
bags in each hand. She hoists and sets them on the counter before turning to
me, then she drops her head toward mine. “Why is Fitz sitting out there
looking like someone just told him he'll never win the Stanley Cup?”
“Because I sent him away.”
“You what?!”
The words are shouted, and I swat her, trying to get her to be quiet.
“Shh!” I say. “Not so loud.”
“Sorry,” she mutters. “I'm just trying to figure out why you sent him
away. And why is he here so early?”
I shrug. “He said something about being up early and running.”
“What is it with these damn hockey players and their running? It's so
gross. Except for when they come home all sweaty—that part is kind of
hot.”
I roll my eyes. “We aren't all blessed with that.”
“True,” she says dreamily. She shakes her head, bringing herself back to
reality from whatever dreamland she just drifted off to. “So, what
happened?”
I slide my eyes in Fitz's direction. He's still just…sitting there. And
staring. I wish I hated it, wish it made my skin crawl, but the way I feel is
neither of those things. It's the exact opposite, really.
I grab Stevie by the arm and tug her to the side of the truck that's not
visible from the lot.
“I told him he's naughty and cute.”
Stevie's jaw slackens, and I swear her eyes grow to twice their normal
size.
“I'm sorry…” she says slowly. “You said what to him?”
“I told him he's naughty and cute,” I rush out again, this time covering
my face with my hands, again not caring about the mess. I'm already a
wreck this morning; what's a little icing in my hair after everything else?
“How? I mean, how exactly did you say those things to him? What was
the context? What led up to that? Why?”
“Okay, that's a lot of questions all at once, but what I believe I said to
him was, I always knew there was a secret naughty streak behind your cute
toothless smile.”
I don't believe I said that to him. I know for a fact I did, mostly because
those words are going to be permanently seared into my brain.
“Okay…and why did you say this again?”
“Because I called him a psycho?”
“Wait, wait.” Stevie holds her hands up. “You called him a naughty cute
toothless psycho?”
“Sort of?” I wince. “It sounds so bad when you say it.”
“Yes, because I'm sure it didn't sound bad at all when you said it.”
“Well, you're taking it out of context, so yes, it's worse coming from
you.”
“Rosie!”
“Stevie!”
She laughs, then shakes her head. “I'm sure it wasn't that bad. I mean,
he's still here. That's something, right?”
“I guess. But I did tell him to go sit over there, so maybe he's just a
good listener?”
“We could say that. Or maybe—and this could be a stretch, it's just a
guess—he thinks you're insane?”
“That's plausible.” I grimace at the thought of Fitz never coming to the
donut truck again because I scared him away. “I'm the worst.”
“No, you're not. You're…well, you.”
“Is that a good thing or a bad thing?”
“Good thing. I think. Most days. But maybe not today because
something is totally off with you.”
I wince, then turn away from her, tugging my gloves off and swapping
them out for fresh ones. I fit them over my hands, then dive back into
getting the donuts ready. “I know. It's… I'm just tired.”
“Late night?” she asks, reaching into the grocery bags and pulling out a
fresh tub of red, white, and blue sprinkles for our Stars, Stripes, and
Sprinkles donuts and a new pitcher to replace the broken one.
“That's an understatement,” I mumble.
I want to say I was up late for a good reason, like studying for the
bachelor's degree I'm currently working toward or brainstorming an
amazing new donut for the truck that'll bring in even more customers.
Something important. Something my parents would be proud of.
But it wasn't any of that.
“Your usual?” I nod. “And? How'd it go?”
“Well, RoPlaying brought in a bunch of cash last night, all while
painting her fingernails.” I pull off a glove and hold my hand up to show off
my fresh manicure.
“Oh, I love that color!” Stevie grabs my hand, looking at it closer. “I
wish I was talented enough to paint my own nails, but I can't do anything
with my damn left hand. It always looks like I let a toddler loose with a
paintbrush.”
I laugh, because I used to be the same way, but I trained myself to get
better at it.
“You know we have no problems with the streaming, but these late
nights…” Stevie starts in that mom tone of hers.
“I know, I know,” I say, understanding what she's getting at. “I promise
to get to bed earlier tonight and triple-check my alarm.”
When I started my account on MyFans, I was just uploading photos. I
wasn't completely nude in them, but they weren't tame either. I was
shocked when people began purchasing them, though I didn't really want to
think about why they were purchasing them. It was fun, and it made me feel
good. Appreciated. Desired.
I loved the feeling so much that, after a few months of selling pics, I
gave streaming a try. If people were paying that much for photos, what
would they pay to see me live?
At first, it was strange having a camera trained on me while I went
about my normal routine, but after a while, it felt weird to not have eyes on
me. I liked it—a lot. Being watched was…exhilarating. It made me feel like
I could do anything. Made me feel sexy, something I had never felt before.
I also enjoyed bringing pleasure to other people. I'm not doing anything
overtly sexual, mostly just stroking my body in suggestive ways and posing
to show off just enough skin to leave them wanting more. It's just enough to
get your mind and heart racing. I've been asked to do a few private videos,
but I always decline them. Being on camera and chatting is one thing, but
I'm not sure I'm ready for more just yet. I don't plan on doing this forever,
but it's fun for now and a great way to pay for my classes.
When I started working here, I was upfront with Scout about my latenight activities. My confession was met with nothing but support, and I
knew I'd found the perfect place for me to work.
“I would never be brave enough to put myself out there like that, so I'm
proud of you,” Stevie says with a warm smile.
Unease slithers through me. I haven't told Scout and Stevie about why
I'm doing this—money.
Don't get me wrong, Scout pays me well, but college isn't cheap. When
I got my bill for my tuition this semester, I wanted to puke, but I didn't let it
stop me because I need this degree and knowledge if I ever want to make
my dream come true—opening my own bakery.
But how do I tell the people who gave me everything I want to branch
out on my own? I'm scared, something I promised I'd stop being a long
time ago. I guess old habits and all that…
“Thanks,” I reply quietly before peeking at the clock. We're down to
only a few minutes before opening, and I'm almost ready. “Want to tell Fitz
he can come grab his donut and coffee before the chaos begins?”
“Why should he get special treatment?”
Stevie and I both spin around at the new voice.
“Greer!” my co-worker squeals excitedly like she didn't just see him
this morning. She crosses the truck and stretches over the counter,
puckering her lips. Her boyfriend happily meets her for a kiss, and I avert
my gaze.
Only I'm not so smart because instead of looking literally anywhere
else, I turn my attention straight to Fitz.
He's looking at me too.
There's a moment when all we do is stare at one another. His hazel eyes
are locked on to my own green ones, and I'm trapped in a damn staring
contest with a hot-as-hell hockey player.
It would be great if I hadn't already embarrassed myself in front of him
several times today.
Just the reminder of it has me tearing my eyes away. I grab the nearest
towel, smacking it against Stevie's ass, which is practically through the
window at this point.
“That's enough.”
She pulls her lips from Greer's and sends me a pout. “But kisses.”
Greer, the grumpy asshole he typically is, sends me a glare. “Yeah,
Rosie, kisses.”
I shake my head. “You're both ridiculous and we need to open, so finish
up or I'll be the one telling Scout you ruined the day,” I tell Stevie with a
pointed look.
She sighs, presses another quick kiss to her boyfriend's lips, and slides
back over the counter and into the truck. “Fine. But only because angry
Scout scares me a little bit.”
“Based on what I've heard from Miller, that's a fair statement,” Greer
comments.
“I'm pretty sure you can't take anything Miller says seriously. He still
plugs in a night-light when we go on the road.” Fitz chuckles lightly, his
eyes drifting to mine only briefly before he turns to Stevie. “Think I could
get a cold brew and two of the Strawber-licious donuts?”
“Sure thing, Fitzy Baby,” she says, heading for the donut rack where
several fresh strawberry donuts are cooling.
“Baby?” Greer practically growls.
Stevie ignores him, and I can't help laughing. Everyone on social media
calls him Fitzy Baby, and I know Stevie is just doing it to screw with Greer.
She loves getting him all wound up.
I get to work on making Fitz's coffee for him. He's been coming here
since he was traded from Vancouver last season, so I know his order by
heart at this point: cold brew with a pump of vanilla, a splash of half-andhalf, and two pink packet sugars. Then, depending on the day, he'll get one
or two strawberry donuts. He'll eat one sitting at the picnic bench he just
abandoned, then he'll take the other to go. He's definitely a creature of
habit, something I've come to learn about all the hockey players who stop
by here.
I finish his drink, then slide it over the counter his way. He reaches for it
before I can remove my hand, and when our fingers brush, I swear I feel it
right down to my toes. A spark of something I can't quite figure out rushes
through me.
If he notices it too, I can't tell. His face gives nothing away.
“Thanks, Rosie,” he says quietly, retracting his hand as well as all the
warmth that just flowed through me. “I like the color you chose.”
I glance down at my hand and my newly painted nails, the one I chose
because a subscriber suggested it because it's his favorite color. I don't tell
him that because then I'd have to admit to what I do on the side. It's not that
I'm ashamed, because I'm not, but I'm also not ready to announce it.
When I look up, Fitz is gone, taking the rest of the concentration I had
right along with him.
This is going to be a long day.

FITZ
I get it. I'm a complete fucking asshole.
I've been watching Rosie stream for two months now, knowing full
fucking well who is behind that black and gold mask, knowing I see her
every day at the donut truck.
Hell, it's what kept me glued to her videos in the first place. When I
happened upon her selfies, even though she was wearing a wig and heavy
makeup, I knew it was her. Those green eyes I can't ever seem to stop
looking at were a dead giveaway.
I tried. I tried really fucking hard to pretend I never stumbled upon her
account. Hell, I went an entire week without seeking her out, but I couldn't
stay away any longer.
So, I caved. I caved, and now I spend entirely too much fucking money
a month to watch her parade around her apartment in lingerie. I'm a sick
fucking man in a fucked-up situation, and it's all my fault.
I even skipped out on the donut truck today because I didn't want to
face her after what happened yesterday. She was frazzled in a way I'd never
seen her be before, and it got even worse after she let her naughty and cute
comment slip. I wasn't expecting it, and based on her reaction, she wasn't
expecting to say it either. But she did, and suddenly, it was out there
hanging between us and making things awkward. I haven't been able to
stop thinking about it since.
The moment the word naughty left her lips, a wave of embarrassment
flooded me because she has no clue just how naughty I really am, watching
her nearly every night, knowing damn well she doesn't know I'm on the
other side of the screen.
Sure, she coupled it with calling my toothless smile cute, something I'm
sure nobody has ever said to me before, but I'm too focused on the other
part.
I should just tell her I found her account. What's the worst that could
happen? Besides, maybe she'll think it's sweet that I support her and won't
think I'm a total creep.
Yeah, like that'll happen.
That's not my luck with women. It's never been my luck with women.
Why would that change now, especially with Rosie, someone who is
completely out of my league? I mean, fuck, she's brave enough to post sexy
photos and strut around for strangers while I can barely even talk to her
without stumbling over my words. We're completely different people.
“Incoming!”
I lift my head just in time. A puck goes sailing by, and judging by the
wind that comes off it and brushes against my face, it was damn close to
hitting me.
“Holy shit!” Miller yells as he strides across the ice. “Fuck, man. Sorry
about that. I thought you'd see it.”
“It's fine,” I tell him.
Though, really, it's not fine. I could have been seriously hurt, and it's all
my fault. I'm totally distracted out here.
We sat through a couple of hours of video reviews and went over our
upcoming schedule, and I'm positive I only retained about fifty percent of
everything we covered. Hell, even Miller was taking notes, and I was just
sitting there like a sleep-deprived zombie.
Now, we're out on the ice, and my mind is still racing. I'm not focused
on my drills like I need to be, even though I really need to be focused
because we're facing Vancouver tomorrow, and I'd rather not make a fool
of myself against my former club.
“You good?” Miller asks.
I nod. “I'm good.”
“You sure? You look a little lost in thought there.”
“Just tired. Late night.”
“You? Mr. Stays at Home Like a Lame Old Man?”
I grin. “That's quite a mouthful of a name.”
“How about Mr. Boring Old Man?”
“Why am I always an old man? Aren't we close to the same age?”
“Yes, but you're still older, and I'm still a spring damn chicken.” He
points to me. “Old man.”
“I'm like ninety-five percent sure every guy on this team would kick
your ass if they heard you talking about how old they are.”
He puffs his chest out. “Pfft. I could take them.”
“Drop the gloves, then.”
We spin around to find Adrian “Beast” Rhodes glaring at Miller with a
challenge in his gaze. I swear I can hear Miller's asshole pucker from here,
and I can't help but laugh when his eyes expand to roughly double their
normal diameter.
“Y-You don't want this smoke,” Miller says, trying his damnedest to
sound tough, but there's no mistaking the tremble in his voice.
Rhodes grins, and though I'm sure he doesn't intend for it to look
menacing, that jagged scar that runs down his face makes it appear that
way. “That's what I thought.”
What's even funnier is that despite the fact that Rhodes looks scary and
definitely throws his weight around on the ice like nobody's business, he's
probably one of the nicest, most loyal guys you'll ever meet.
He looks at me. “What's up with you today? You seem off. Everything
good?”
“He had a late night,” Miller answers for me, an obnoxious grin on his
face.
Beast's brows rise high. “That so? Special overnight guest?”
“Only if you count Carl.”
He frowns at my answer. “It's so weird that you named your female cat
Carl.”
“I didn't name her. She named herself.”
“Right.” He rolls his eyes. “Just keep your head up. There are idiots out
here all over this ice just whipping pucks around.”
He strides backward toward his own set of drills he's been running all
morning.
“Hey!” Miller protests at the insult a full thirty seconds after he skates
away, finally catching on to the fact that Rhodes was talking about him.
“How rude,” he says, putting his hands on his hips a la Stephanie Tanner.
This time it's me who rolls his eyes. “Get back to work.”
“Fine,” he grumbles. “But keep your head up—I don't need my ass beat
today. I'm pretty sure Scout wouldn't appreciate it if I came home with a
black eye.” He tips his head, then a slow grin spreads across his lips. “On
second thought, hit me. I want to test this theory. Maybe she'll think it's hot
and jump my bones.”
I shove him. “Go away, Miller.”
“I'm going, I'm going. Nobody is any fun today. Everyone is boring—
and moving slow as fuck, which I really don't like to see.”
I thought it was just me, but as I stand here looking out at the ice, all the
guys are a little sluggish. I'd be fine with it if so much wasn't riding on this
season. The Comets have taken several first-round Playoff exits in the years
since the team last won the Cup. Everyone is on thin ice, especially our
coaching staff. Not a single person on this team wants to see anything
happen to our head coach, Heller.
Coach Heller, or Coach Hell as we sometimes call him because the dude
can make life a living hell, is the best there ever was, and it would be a
damn shame to see him go down because of our mistakes. We all know it's
the nature of the business when a team isn't performing the way it should
be, but in some way, it will be on all our shoulders too.
This season, we need to win. We have to win. For Coach, for ourselves.
There's no other choice.
An idea hits me, and I'm shocked I'm even thinking about it because
when I say I hate going out, I mean it. It's my least favorite thing ever,
especially since I'm usually stuck babysitting all the rookies, but maybe
that's exactly what this team needs: some bonding time.
“Miller!”
He lifts his head my way, then skates back toward me when I beckon
him over.
“'Sup?”
“You're right, we're slow. We should probably do something about it.”
His eyes light up. “Oh! I know what we could do—Slapshots. All of
us.”
I try not to laugh because it was entirely too easy to make him think this
was his idea, but that's Miller for you.
I nod. “I think that's a good idea.”
“So, you're in, then? Like you'll actually come out with us?”
“I mean, if it's for the team, I guess I could consider it.”
He punches my shoulder lightly. “Nine good?”
I nearly balk at his suggestion. Nine at night? We probably wouldn't
leave until eleven or later…I'll completely miss RoPlaying streaming.
But it's fine. Totally cool. It's for the team, right? And I'd do anything
for the team, even miss my favorite late-night activity.
“I'll check my schedule,” I tell him dryly.
“As if it's actually full.” He laughs, and I'm not even hurt by his
comment because it's a fair assessment. “All right, then, it's settled. I'll
rally the troops.”
I nod, watching him skate away and up to Hayes, who excitedly agrees.
I go back to my drills, trying not to freak out about what I've just gotten
myself into.
I won't lie, we just arrived and I'm already itching to pull my phone from
my pocket and check to see if RoPlaying is online. This is usually the time
she starts her streams, and I'm dying to check in on her.
It's ridiculous. I'm ridiculous for this little obsession of mine, but I'm
going to chalk it all up to superstition. It hasn't escaped my notice that
whenever I catch a stream, I score the next game. Might as well keep that
going, right? I'll do whatever it takes to keep us winning games. It's still
early in the season, but we need all the points we can get in a tight division
like ours.
Yeah, that's what it is, I tell myself.
“First round is on me!” Miller shouts through cupped hands, and
everyone in our group cheers, drawing the attention of just about every
patron in the bar.
To be fair, we've been drawing attention since the moment we walked
through the doors. Sure, Slapshots is known as the Comets' frequent
hangout, but that doesn't mean we don't turn heads whenever we walk in.
Add in the fact that there are about fifteen or so of us here and that we had
to combine three different tables so we could all sit together, and we
definitely have the attention of the entire room.
“Water for me,” requests Hollis, the fiancée of our team captain,
Lowell. She lays a hand on her large belly, a grin playing on her lips.
Since she and Lowell are days away from having their second kid, this
may be their last chance to come out for quite a while. It's crazy to me
because I can't even imagine having one child while trying to juggle a
hockey career, let alone two of them running around. They're brave, that's
for damn sure.
Miller sends her a thumbs-up before heading to the bar to place our
orders. We've all been here enough times for Rod, the owner, to know what
we want. Sometimes I don't even have to say anything, and he just slides a
fresh IPA my way.
“That's a lot of drinks. Should someone go help him?” Wright speaks
up. “I mean, it is Miller…”
“Hey!” Scout, Miller's girlfriend, shouts in his defense, but there's no
denying the smile on her lips. She's aware Miller is the guy we all love and
love to pick on. He's used to it, and so is she.
“Nah. Let him figure it out on his own.”
“Adrian!” his wife admonishes, sending him a glare.
He sighs, then shoves away from the table, heading toward the bar to
help Miller. It's hilarious to see a man so big and scarred as Rhodes fall at
his wife's feet like he does, but he's madly in love with the woman he drunk
married in Vegas. I remember sitting in Vancouver when the news broke
about it. It was all over every NHL website and social media page, going
viral over and over again. I'm not sure anyone thought they'd still be
together years later, but it's clear as day that's not changing anytime soon.
“Can't believe we managed to get us all together outside of the rink. I
don't think that's happened since…” Smith, a past player on the Comets
turned video coach, tips his head as he thinks about it. “Shit, I'm not sure
when. Maybe when I was still playing?”
Emilia, his girlfriend, gives him a soft smile at the mention of his old
career. Smith used to be known around the league for racking up assists like
crazy, and everyone called him Granny Apple Smith. The dude is going
down as a legend for making some crazy goals happen.
“Had to have been before Hayes and Fitzy Baby joined the team,”
Wright says, nodding his head toward our end of the table.
“I think you might be right,” Lowell chimes in.
Greer grunts. “That's because nobody wants to be seen in public with
Miller.”
“Hey!” Scout says again, and we all laugh, including her.
“Be nice,” Stevie whispers to her grumpy boyfriend.
The command is quiet, but since I'm sitting right next to her, I don't
miss it, which means I don't miss when Greer's cheeks darken with
embarrassment. It's such a rare look for him that I can't help but laugh,
earning me a nice middle finger from the grumpy goalie himself.
“What'd I miss? Why is Greer flipping people off now?”
The baker who banished me plops down in the empty chair across from
me, and I guess that answers the question of if she's streaming.
Her blonde hair that's normally twisted up in a messy bun is hanging
loosely around her shoulders. While she's typically hidden behind an apron,
there's never been any mistaking that Rosie has a whole lot of curves, and
the tight, low-cut, off-the-shoulder black top doesn't do anything to veil
them either. This look is a lot closer to what she wears during her streams,
and I'm doing all I can to not take notice—to not let my dick take notice.
I'm failing because it's really hard to ignore her beauty.
Rosie gives Stevie a one-armed hug, then peers around the table,
waving and smiling at everyone who already knows her from the donut
truck we all frequent. There's no mistaking the moment she realizes I'm
here, and this time it's her cheeks that darken.
“Oh,” she mutters. “You.”
A chuckle rumbles out because it's obvious she's thinking about our
encounter the other morning.
“Me,” I reply.
Stevie snickers, drawing our attention. Her gaze is flitting between me
and Rosie, and I have no doubt it's because she knows what happened. It
was painfully obvious the two of them were discussing it while I was sitting
at the table.
“What's up with you two?” Greer asks, not missing the tension between
us.
“Nothing!” Rosie says way too loudly and quickly. Then those jade eyes
are on me, narrowed and daring me to say something that challenges her
answer.
Like the gentleman my momma raised me to be, I roll my lips together
and keep quiet.
“Right,” Greer says, not believing anything Rosie says, and I don't
blame him. I wouldn't believe us either, not with how fidgety Rosie is
acting.
Really, it's for nothing. So she had a slip of the tongue and called me
naughty and cute…big deal. No reason to be flustered by it. I mean, I've
practically forgotten about it by now.
Okay, no. That's a lie. It's still rattling around in my head, but whatever.
I'm cool. We're cool.
“Hey there, Rosie,” Hayes says, sliding his arm across the back of her
chair and leaning into her.
She shoots him a megawatt grin, the same one she gives me every
morning when I show up for my caffeine fix. “Hey there, Hayes.”
He winks at her, and she giggles.
A twinge of annoyance rushes through me at Hayes being so cozy with
Rosie. I don't like it because I know how the young forward is with women.
He treats them as nothing more than something to play with for a bit, then
leaves them in the dust. Rosie deserves better than that.
She also deserves better than me being a creep and watching her
streams, but we're not going to get into that now.
“I present to you: alcohol!” Miller shouts at the opposite end of the table
from us as he sets down a tray filled with glasses. Rhodes sets another tray
down beside us, and I automatically reach for the IPA that's sitting nearest
me.
“Hey, Rosie. Glad you could join us. What can I get you to drink?”
Rhodes asks. “Miller's buying, so make sure it's something expensive.”
“Um…” She taps a perfectly manicured finger against her chin a few
times before saying, “Vodka soda?”
“Top-shelf vodka soda—got it. Be right back.” He heads off back
toward the bar.
I bring my beer to my lips and take a hefty drink, thankful for the
delicious hoppy liquid that slides down my throat. I'm starting to feel a
little on edge, and I'm not exactly sure why, but I want it to stop. Hopefully,
this will help.
I can feel eyes on me, and when I lift my gaze, I'm surprised to find
Rosie staring at me intently. Her eyes are flitting over every inch of my
face, and it's getting hot under her stare. I hate it and love it all at the same
time.
When she realizes I've caught her staring, she doesn't hide it. She
simply quirks a brow, like she's begging me to say something.
I don't. Instead, I look away, grinning into my beer like an idiot. She's
so feisty, and I fucking love it.
“Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you…” Miller starts as he passes out drinks. “I
signed us all up for karaoke.”
“What?!”
“How?!”
“They don't even have karaoke here!”
I have no idea who exactly shouts their displeasure, but I agree with all
of them. I'd rather pull out another one of my teeth before singing karaoke.
“I brought my machine from home. Rod said it was cool.”
“Dammit, Rod!” Lowell hollers toward the bar, shaking his fist in the
air.
The owner-slash-bartender shrugs, then returns to making drinks.
“You have a karaoke machine?” Wright asks Miller.
“That you brought from home?” Disgust and disbelief drip off every one
of Rhodes' words.
“Scout, how could you let him get a karaoke machine?” Harper asks.
“You know that's just asking for trouble.”
She holds her hands up. “Hey, that was all on him. I walked into his
apartment one day and it was just there, and he was singing Shania Twain.
He refuses to return it.”
“Because it's awesome! Besides, someone had to bring the fun tonight,
and I volunteered myself.” Miller points at Rhodes, Smith, and Greer. “You
three assholes are grumpy about ninety-nine percent of the time.” He moves
on to Wright and Lowell. “And you two are just old dudes who are all
settled down and shit and never want to do anything fun because of your
ladies.” He looks at Harper and Hollis. “No offense, of course.” His eyes
land on me next. “Then there's Fitz and Hayes. They're just…well, Fitz and
Hayes.”
“Hey, I'm fun!” Hayes tries to redeem his image.
“A little too fun sometimes.” The captain throws daggers toward the
forward, probably annoyed because Hayes got in some trouble over the
summer and we all had to hear about it from management.
I get it. Hayes can be a handful, but he's still a good kid. A little
immature, but weren't we all at some point?
“He's fun,” I say, sticking up for him. “But I take no offense at what's
been said about me. I am boring, and I'm totally cool with it.”
“You're not boring,” Stevie says softly. “You just prefer your own
company.”
“More like the company of his hand.” Hayes holds his palm up, waiting
for someone to slap it.
And someone does—the curvaceous blonde with lime eyes sitting
across from me.
Rosie.
I raise a brow at her, surprised by her betrayal.
“What?” She shrugs, not caring what she's just endorsed. “See a hand,
smack a hand.”
“Gave me cookie, got you cookie,” Hayes says before holding his hand
up again, and Rosie slaps it once more.
“That one was a bit cheap because I love New Girl, but see? You can't
deny someone a high five. It's impossible.”
I hold my hand up, just to test her theory.
She smacks her palm against mine. “See?” she says excitedly. “It's just
the natural reaction.”
“All right. I'll allow it.” I lean across the table. “But just so you know,
that makes the third time you've insulted me.”
Her eyes flare as she sinks lower in her chair, covering her face, and I
swear I hear an “Oh god” come out of her. I laugh, then take another sip of
my beer.
Maybe tonight won't be so bad after all.

ROSIE
When Stevie invited me out tonight, I figured it would be fun. I've been out
with the players a few times, and there are always lots of laughs to be had.
And fine, maybe a tiny part of me was hoping Fitz would be here. I
haven't seen him in a few days, and I'm not sure if it's because he's
avoiding the donut truck or if it's for a different reason. If he is avoiding
Scout's Sweets, I don't blame him. I made it plenty awkward the other day;
he has no reason to want to come back.
Now that I'm here and sitting across from him…ugh, I wish more than
anything I had magical powers and could make myself invisible because I
did it again, stuck my whole damn foot in my mouth, and then some.
“Why, why, why…” I chant to myself as I walk out of the bathroom
stall, the same one I've been hiding in for the last ten minutes.
Not only did I mess things up with Fitz the other day, I just did it again
when I high-fived Hayes for insulting him. I played it cool and shrugged off
his comments, but deep down, I'm totally dying inside, and I'm really
beginning to believe something is truly wrong with me. It's the only
explanation I have for being off my game like I am.
“Are you talking to yourself again?”
I clutch my chest, whirling around to find Stevie leaning against a wall.
She shoves off, stalking toward me with a smirk.
“How did you…” I shake my head, moving toward the sink and
dispensing soap onto my hands. I run them under the water for the requisite
twenty seconds, then grab a few paper towels. I turn, leaning against the
counter as I dry my hands off. “What are you doing in here?”
“Checking on you because, no offense, you're kind of a mess this week.
That isn't like you at all.”
“Yes, you're right. I'm always super put together.”
We both laugh because that's not true at all. Sure, I'm not usually this
big of a mess, but put together? That's not me either.
“Is it okay that Fitz is here?”
“Of course. Why wouldn't it be?”
She gestures noncommittally. “You know…all your nerves. The slip of
the tongue. You calling him naughty and cute. Your intense staring session
out there. Is it your crush on him?”
I whip my head back. “My…” I sputter out a laugh. “What crush? What
are you talking about?”
She lifts a shoulder. “Well, I mean, I kind of figured you had one.
You're always talking about how hot he is.”
“Well, duh. You have eyes—you can see how attractive that man is. I
mean, those eyelashes alone.”
“Ugh, men always have the best eyelashes.”
“And that jaw of his? Perfection.”
“Greer's is better, but Fitz's isn't so bad.”
“And those hazel eyes? Wow. Wow! Talk about mesmerizing. Don't
even get me started on his missing tooth. It's just…” I sigh. “So hot.”
Stevie doesn't say anything for several moments, then suddenly, she's
doubled over, clutching her stomach as she laughs louder and harder than
I've ever seen her laugh before.
“What? Why are you laughing?”
She looks up at me briefly, then drops her head, laughing again. I fold
my arms over my chest, staring daggers at her while she continues to laugh.
It feels like hours before she finally settles down, but when she does, I am
not expecting what she says next.
“You're totally into him. Like full-blown writing his name and drawing
hearts on your notebook kind of into him.”
“What? You're insane!” I retort. “There is no way. Fitz is just…well,
he's Fitz. Cute, yes, but a crush? No. That's not… That's not…”
Oh god.
Realization smacks me right in the face.
Ohgodohgodohgod.
I've been a bumbling idiot around him all evening, and I was the other
day too. I chalked up the incident at the donut truck to just being tired and
exhausted, but now that I'm acting like a fool tonight, maybe it's more than
that. Maybe it's…
“Oh no. Oh no no no no.” The last time I felt like this was when I
realized things about my former best friend. When I realized… “I have a
crush on him.”
I look up at Stevie, who doesn't look the least bit shocked by my
revelation.
“I have a crush on Fitz,” I tell her.
“Yes, I know.”
“Like a real, true crush.”
“I know,” she repeats with a grin. “So, what are you going to do about
it?”
“Nothing!” I rush out. “Not a thing.”
“What? Why not?”
“Because I can't! I'm… I'm…”
“A totally single and available girl?”
“Well, yeah. But—”
“A smokin' hot babe who Fitz would be so lucky to have?”
“Of course, but—”
“No. No buts. You're going to walk out there and—”
“I can't, Stevie.”
“Yes, you can.”
“No. You don't get it. I can't.” I wring my hands and begin walking the
length of the bathroom, back and forth and back again.
Stevie's brows crash together as she watches me pace around like a
nervous lunatic. I'm sure she's wondering what's going on because this isn't
me. At least, this isn't the version of me Stevie knows.
I've worked hard over the last few years to not be the timid version of
myself I used to be, to not be scared to go after what I want. For the most
part, I've done that. I went out and got the baking job I wanted. I've started
putting myself out there with friends. I mean, I'm out at a bar with
professional hockey players. Hell, strangers pay me to stream in lingerie for
crying out loud! Not to mention I'm going to school for my business degree
so I can open my own bakery one day.
This me is so different from the woman I was. I overthought everything.
I let so much of life pass me by, and after what happened with Levi, I
vowed to never, ever be that person again.
But here I am—scared once more.
When Stevie gets tired of my pacing, she steps toward me, putting a
hand on my arm to stop me.
“I…” I blow out a breath. “I've been in this spot before. With my…” I
swallow a lump that's seemed to form in my throat. “With my ex-best
friend. We… Well, I sort of fell in love with him, and…”
“He didn't love you back,” she guesses with a sad smile.
I nod. “Yeah. So as you can see…”
“This is super hard for you.”
“Yes.”
She sighs. “All right, I get that. I really do, but being scared? That's not
the Rosie I know. That's not the woman who dresses like a wet dream and
streams for thousands of people every night. That's not the woman who
bosses me around on the regular and takes control of every crazy situation
like it's nothing. That's not the woman who has been working hard to
embrace everything she is. You're a badass who can do whatever she wants.
Own it.”
The longer she speaks, the more my shoulders press back because
Stevie is right. I've come so far. Why am I letting some guy set me back
now?
“I'm going out there,” I tell her confidently.
“Hell yeah you are!” Stevie shouts, hyping me up.
“I'm going to march up to him.”
“Yes!” She whoops loudly, clapping her hands together.
“And I'm going to ask him out.”
“There's my girl!” She grabs my shoulders, steering me toward the
door. “Let's go get him!”
“Yes!”
Only, when I reach for the handle, I pause because all those fears from
before start settling into my stomach again. What if Fitz turns me away like
Levi did? What if I'm not enough for him? What if he laughs and tells me
to get lost? What if…
“What if he doesn't like me?”
“I'm sorry, have you seen your knockers? Of course he'll like you!”
It's just enough to make me laugh, and all my nerves fizzle away.
I shove my shoulders back and pull the door open. My eyes zero in on
the table the rest of our party is at. Everyone is lost in conversation,
including Fitz, who is currently laughing at something Hayes is saying. He
looks so hot with his head thrown back, his eyes screwed tightly shut, and
his adorable toothless grin on full display.
“I want to kiss his face.”
Stevie laughs from beside me. “Maybe don't lead with that.”
We make our way back to the table just in time to hear them start
talking about the game they have on Thursday.
“Puh-lease tell me you're going to be starting in goal for the next
game,” I say to Greer, dropping back down into my chair. “Those two
points against Nashville after all the bullshit that happened with you getting
injured last season would be so damn good.”
“Not really up to me,” he says. “That's all on Coach.”
But I can tell from his eyes that he wants to be in goal too, wants to get
his revenge on the team that steamrolled him, knocked him out of the game
for a few weeks, and then subsequently cost the team a deep Playoff run as
they took another first-round exit. Everyone knows it's too many in a row
now, which spells trouble across the board.
“For what it's worth, Macie agrees,” Stevie says, referring to her
hockey-obsessed daughter. Sometimes I think she loves the game more than
the guys out there on the ice. “And, of course, she's hoping for a good
scrum or two.”
“Hell, I'm hoping for a good scrum,” Rhodes chimes in. “That fucker
barreled over Greer on purpose. I know it, and he knows it too. He's got a
beating coming.”
“Didn't you whoop his ass already?” Hayes asks.
“Sure.” Rhodes shrugs, then a vicious grin appears on his face. “Doesn't
mean I wouldn't like to do it again.”
Ryan, his wife, fans herself. “Ugh, I love it when you get all growly like
that.”
Several of the guys groan, but I hear no objections from the other wives
and girlfriends at the table because I'm sure they feel the same way Ryan
does. I know I do.
I'm not one of those people who watch the game just for the fights.
Hockey is entertaining in other ways too, but I'd be a damn liar if I said
seeing the guys dropping gloves doesn't make my lady bits tingle in all the
right ways.
“Can I be the one to go after him? I'm itching to have my first fight this
year.”
My eyes slide over to Hayes. “You've never been in a fight?”
“Not in the NHL. AHL, a few times.”
“You'll get one eventually. We all have to answer the bell at some
point,” Lowell says. He would know since last season he had his very first
fight himself. He came out with a black eye, a bruised knuckle, and a
Gordie Howe hat trick. It was amazing.
“I've never been in a fight either,” Fitz says from across the table.
Slowly, I turn toward him. “Never?”
He shakes his head. “Not even in juniors.”
“Damn.” Hayes whistles. “We gotta get our boy in a tussle or two
before his career is over.”
“How'd you lose your tooth, then? I always figured it was a fight.”
“I lost a tooth?” He sits forward, his brows wrinkling in fake concern. “I
didn't do inventory this morning, so you'll have to tell me which one.” He
smiles big, poking his tongue right through the gap in his teeth.
Heat rises in my cheeks for what feels like the fifth time in his presence,
and I'm really starting to think this reaction from me is exclusive to Fitz.
He laughs, sitting back in his chair. “I took a stick up high.” He points
to the faded scar on his chin. “Got me here too. Ten stitches.”
I lean across the table to get a good look at it. When I move, so does he.
He's right…there…only a few inches away, and I'm stuck. I can't
move. It's not possible, not when he's so near and when he's looking at me
like he is.
His eyes are the perfect swirl of green, brown, and amber. Those damn
long, dark lashes of his are thick and make the color ten times more potent.
Being this close, I can see the dots of freckles under his eyes. It's just a
smattering, and I itch to reach over and trace every single one with the tip
of my finger.
“Your eyes…” I hear myself say. “They're beautiful.”
Said eyes widen, and someone clears their throat, breaking the staring
contest we're trapped in. It's Greer, his stare bouncing back and forth
between us yet again. It lingers on Fitz for a moment longer than me, which
has him falling back in his chair. He reaches for his beer and chugs the
entirety of it, then drags the back of his hand over his mouth.
“Going to grab a refill,” Fitz mutters before abruptly rising from his
chair and making his way across the bar.
“Is anyone else going to say anything about the eye-fucking that just
happened?”
“Shut the fuck up, Hayes,” Greer mutters through clenched teeth.
I ignore them both, mostly because I'm already out of my chair and
following Fitz to the bar. It's clear I've made him uncomfortable, and we
both know it's not the first time today. I need to apologize.
“Hey,” I say, slipping onto the stool next to him.
He startles a bit, then gives me a tight smile, shifting around on the
stool, almost angling himself away from me.
Yep. I totally made things awkward between us. Awesome.
“Hey,” he says tentatively. His eyes go to the empty glass in my hand,
and he signals for Rod once more. “Vodka soda, too. My tab.”
Rod nods, letting us know he heard him.
“You didn't have to do that. Besides, I'm pretty sure it's me who owes
you drinks at this point.”
Fitz laughs. “True, but it's the gentlemanly thing to do, and I'm pretty
sure my momma would whoop my ass if she heard I didn't offer to buy you
a drink.”
“Are you, a grown man, scared of your mom?”
He lifts both brows. “Damn right I am. She might be a tiny Russian
woman, but she's scary as hell.”
“Your mother's Russian? That explains your first name.”
“Yep, that's from her. My father is Irish. Quite the combo, huh?”
“Do you speak anything other than English?”
He leans into me, and I find myself matching his movements, eager to
hear whatever it is he's about to say. Those hazel eyes peer into me, and I
swear he's looking right at my soul as he whispers a few things in a
language I know nothing about.
Well, fuck me. I swear every word he just spoke—whatever the hell they
were—went right between my legs.
“What does that mean?” I ask, hoping he doesn't hear how breathy that
came out.
“I have a pet goat.”
“Oh.”
My cheeks heat yet again, and a laugh bubbles out of me.
“What?” he asks, his lips quirked up in a smile. “What's so funny?”
“Nothing.” I shake my head. “I just…I didn't expect that.”
Did I just get totally horny from him saying that? Guilty as charged.
Rod sets our refills in front of us, and I reach for mine as if I haven't
had anything to drink in days. I drain half the glass, then immediately regret
it. I've not had a lot to eat today, and I'm a bit of a lightweight. I already
know this is going to go straight to my head.
I set my glass back on the bar top, then turn to Fitz, who is slowly
sipping on his beer. “So, do you really?”
“Hm?” He shifts until he's facing me.
“Do you have a pet goat?”
“Oh, no. But there's a guy who is a season ticket holder for the Comets,
comes to all the games and spends a shit ton of money at the events, and he
has several pet goats—like a whole litter of them.”
“A litter?”
Fitz nods. “At least eight, but it could be more by now. Who knows.”
“He sounds amazing. I've always wanted a big farm with lots of
animals.”
“Really?” He tips his head, studying me. “You seem like more of a bigcity gal to me.”
I shrug. “I mean, sure, I like living in the city, but being somewhere
quiet with land would be nice too. And great internet, of course.”
He laughs. “A necessity at this point.”
“Sometimes I love the internet and sometimes I hate it. It's this great
place where everybody can be whoever they want to be, but it's also
dangerous for that exact reason.”
“A double-edged sword, that's for sure. I don't get on social media
often, but sometimes I'll see the comments on the team's pages and…” He
shudders. “They're something. And creepy.”
“Oh, trust me, I am well aware of how creepy people can be.”
During my last live stream, I had no less than ten people tell me they
wanted to jizz all over my tits. The saddest part is that's a tame night for
me. The messages that fill my inbox… They're downright pornographic.
There are some diamonds in the rough, though, like ShootsAndScores.
Every time I sign off my streaming videos and he's been watching, he sends
me a note that always feels so…genuine compared to the rest, like maybe
he's not watching me just for my tits. Like last time when he chose my nail
polish color. It wasn't the usual “pink to match the head of my swollen
cock” comment. He was one of the few who wasn't a total perv. While that
shouldn't be unique enough to make him stand out, it is.
“So, do you know anything else in Russian?”
“Not a damn word.”
I bark out a laugh. “You can only say I have a pet goat?”
“Much to my grandmother's dismay, yes.”
“Does your mother speak Russian?”
“A little. When my grandparents came over to the US, they tried hard to
blend in and only speak Russian at home or whenever they absolutely
needed to. So, my mother grew up speaking English and only picked up a
little bit of Russian over the years. Whenever she'd read to me and my
sister at bedtime, there was this book about this bad goat, Billy B. Bad or
something like that. She'd read some parts in Russian and some in English,
something her mother would do with her. I don't remember the entire story
now, but I still remember how to say I have a pet goat in Russian because
that was the opening line of the book. My sister knows more and even
studied it in college, but I just don't have the knack for picking up other
languages.”
I don't say anything because I don't know what to say. It's not only the
most I've ever heard Fitz say all at once, it's also the most I've ever learned
about him. Seeing him open up and talk like this…I'm not used to it, and I
wish he would do it more.
“What?” he asks after several seconds of silence.
I shake my head. “It's nothing. It's just…you don't talk very often, so
I'm taking it all in.”
“Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm not big on talking. I like listening more. I'm more
of an observer. A…”
“A loner?”
When his brows shoot up, I realize how awful that came out.
“That sounded so bad, like I was calling you a loser or something. I
wasn't. I would never. There's nothing wrong with being a loner. Hell, I'm
a loner. In fact, if I wasn't out tonight, I'd be at home sitting in front of my
co—what? Why are you grinning at me like that?”
“It's nothing. You're just, uh…” His cheeks flush. “I like it when you
ramble.”
Now it's my cheeks that heat up.
He likes it when I ramble? Well, I like that he likes it when I ramble.
Hell, I'm beginning to suspect I like everything about him. Minus the
running, of course. That part is just gross, and you cannot change my mind
on that.
“Thank you.” I tuck a loose strand of hair behind my ear. “I think.”
He chuckles quietly. “You're welcome. It's cute.”
I cover my face, groaning into my hands at his reference from the other
morning, and I hear him laugh. No, I feel him laugh, my entire body
vibrating from the rumble that leaves him.
Then he does something I'm not expecting. He wraps his hands around
my wrists and pulls at my arms. All at once, every fiber of my being is on
fire, and if this is what it feels like to burn, I'll do it every day for the rest of
forever.
“Come on, no hiding. I didn't hide.”
He tugs gently on me again, and this time I let him pull my hands away.
“Because you couldn't. I banished you.”
Another laugh rolls out of him. “Yeah, you did. That was very naughty
of you.”
There is no doubt in my mind that I look like a fucking tomato with how
red my face feels. I try to hide again, but he doesn't let me. In fact, he
doesn't stop touching me at all. He just holds my wrists in his hands and…
Is that his thumb rubbing against me?
I glance down just in time to see him swipe it over the inside of my
wrist twice before he realizes what he's doing and yanks his hands away.
I miss his touch instantly.
“I'm sorry,” he says. “I didn't mean to embarrass you.”
“And I didn't mean to embarrass you. I'm not usually so…”
“Frazzled?”
I nod. “Yeah, that. It was just an…off morning for me.”
“I know. That's why I didn't think much of it.” He shrugs, then brings
his beer up to his lips, taking a healthy sip before setting it back on the
counter. How he makes drinking a beer that smells like a skunk's ass so hot,
I don't even know, but watching as he swallows…the way he drags his
tongue over his lips…it's mesmerizing. I swear I could watch a ten-hour
movie on this alone.
Holy crap, my crush on this man is so bad. Like beyond bad. The last
time I felt this way about someone was…
I swallow back the lump that's formed in my throat, trying to ignore it,
trying to ignore all the old insecurities that are rising. I don't need them. I
don't want them. They aren't true.
I'm Rosie Calhoun. I am a badass who goes after what she wants, and
right now, I want Fitz.
“Well, now that we've gotten all that out of the way…I was wondering
if—”
His cell buzzes against the bar top, drawing both of our attention.
“Sorry,” he mutters, grabbing it and turning the screen on. He sits
forward, his eyes attached to whatever's happening. A small smile plays at
the corners of his lips. “I'm sorry,” he says again, completely enamored by
whatever is on his screen, which I can't see from my vantage point. “I, uh, I
have to go. Someone needs me.”
He's up and out of his chair, leaving before I can even ask if everything
is okay. He stops to quickly say goodbye to the rest of the raucous crowd
we're with, then he's out the door and disappearing into the night.
I'm Rosie Calhoun. I am a badass who goes after what she wants, and
right now, what I want just walked out the door to go home to someone
else.
Lucky me.

FITZ
I'm not proud of what happened at Slapshots tonight.
Not the walking-out-of-the-bar part—while I didn't like leaving Rosie,
especially when we were having a good conversation, that part was
justified.
It was something else.
It was when we were sitting with the rest of the group and she leaned
over the table to get a look at my faded scar, and like some idiot, I let her.
Hell, I even met her inch for inch.
She was so close and smelled so fucking good, like strawberries, and
she was staring me right in the eyes, and then it happened…the thing I'm
not proud of.
I got a boner.
I got a fucking boner. I'm in my mid-twenties, dammit! I should be able
to control my dick a whole lot better than that, but I didn't. I didn't control
my dick and I popped a fucking boner from a staring contest, then ran away
like a scared child.
Only she followed.
She followed me, and I hated it…but I loved it too.
It's not usual for me to get worked up like that, especially not in public,
but her sitting there looking at me like she was seconds away from reaching
her tongue out and running it along my jaw… Fuck me. It did something to
me, something I really liked…something I wouldn't mind a repeat of.
But I have a feeling I completely blew it tonight, all thanks to fucking
Carl.
I glare over at the fluffy white-brown cat who is snoozing away in her
tower like she didn't just ruin my entire night. When I initially got a
notification on my phone, I laughed when I saw her prancing about the
apartment. Sure, she was a little shit for being up on the countertops when
she knows I hate it, but it's her place too. Then she had to go and do the one
damn thing that drives me nuts and is the whole reason I installed the
cameras to begin with: she locked herself in the pantry.
For being smart enough to pull the door open—I really need to get my
super to fix that—she sure is dumb when it comes to not locking herself
inside. This is the fourth time she's done it. Last time, I was at an away
game and had to get my neighbor, Miss Drake, to let her out. I, of course,
then saw Miss Drake take her bathrobe off and sit stark naked on my couch.
Since I just got those images out of my brain, I really didn't want a repeat
of that tonight, so I grabbed an Uber and booked it home to let Carl out.
So now I'm sitting at my computer with a controller in my hand, trying
to work out my frustration because I got cockblocked by my cat.
“Holy fuck, my life is sad,” I say to myself.
Carl stirs a bit at my words, and her eyes peek open just enough for her
to narrow them at me. So, I do the mature thing and flip her off. She gives
me a look that says, Do it again and I will murder you in your sleep. I don't
doubt her threat for a second.
Ugh, how pathetic am I? Having a pissing contest with my cat? What a
sad, sad life I'm leading. I'm even sadder than—
Ping!
My eyes go to the corner of the screen, and my lips part when I see the
notification that's bouncing there.
RoPlaying is online. Would you like to watch?
I've never in my life clicked a button faster.
I toss my controller to the side, not caring at all about saving whatever
game I was just playing, then give all my attention to the screen as Rosie
fills it.
I can tell almost instantly that something is different tonight. For one,
she's streaming way later than she typically does, but it's more than that.
She looks…off. Still gorgeous, but off. Maybe it's how tightly her brows
are drawn together as she lies on her belly on the floor with a coloring book
spread out before her. She's pressing so hard on the pages her knuckles are
turning white. She's quiet as usual, but it feels like more tonight. It's like
she's…
“Oh, fuck.”
She's upset.
She's upset, and I have no doubt in my mind I'm to blame for it.
I left her sitting at the bar like a total asshat. I didn't give her any sort of
explanation. I bolted. I should have explained better, should have told her I
wasn't leaving because I didn't want to talk to her anymore. I should have
just told her I had to leave because my cat insists on cockblocking me and it
had nothing to do with her.
But I didn't say any of that because my social skills when it comes to
women are about non-existent. I had the same girlfriend through high
school. We broke up when she went off to college, and hockey consumed
my life from there. I've had some one-night stands and short flings, like the
girl who dumped me for liking to watch, but nothing serious, especially not
with women like Rosie, who is so damn strong and fierce. She scares me as
much as she turns me on, and I'm not exactly sure what that says about me,
but I don't have the time to analyze it now.
I'm too worried about how I've somehow managed to screw up Rosie's
night by being an asshole. Albeit unintentionally, but still.
My eyes stay trapped on the screen as she colors for an hour. It's a full
hour of nearly complete silence. The only sound she makes is the
occasional sigh or groan. Nothing has been said, and yet, I still can't seem
to look away. She has that kind of effect on me.
When her eyes flit to the side of the screen of her laptop, I know she's
about to log off, and I swear I've never wanted her to stay more.
I wish I had more courage, wish I were brave enough to reach out and
tell her I'm sorry for leaving tonight. But I can't because that would be
admitting so much, and I don't want to open that can of worms.
“Sorry I was extra quiet tonight,” she says, looking directly into the
camera. “It's been a long day, but being here with you all has made it
better.”
Her eyes go to the chat box that's already filling with mostly disgusting
comments from anonymous assholes.
WineDine69: I want to cum all over your titz bby gurl.
EatinP: SHOW US YOUR CANS!
BigDNRGY: I want to motorboat you, then fuck your ass.
I want to find every single one of these idiots and kick their ass.
But I can't. So instead, I do what I do every night—I send her a
message.
ShootsAndScores: It sounds like you had a rough day, and I'm sorry about
that. I hope tomorrow is much better. You deserve it. Good night, Ro.
A genuine smile forms on her lips for the first time this evening, and I tell
myself it's because of my message.
“Good night,” she says, and once again, I pretend it's just for me.
The screen goes black, and I lean back, staring at the void, wishing I'd
never gotten myself into this situation and had never found her stream.
Maybe then I wouldn't be sitting here with a giant hole in my chest that
makes me feel like shit.
I want to make this right with her. Tonight. Now.
But I can't.
Ping!
My eyes find the notification in the corner of the screen, then I'm
stumbling out of my chair and away from the computer because What in the
actual fuck?
RoPlaying has sent you a message.
I read the notification once.
Twice.
Three fucking times.
She messaged me.
She fucking messaged me!
What. The. Fuck.
I drag my hands through my hair repeatedly, like I'm trying to scrub this
from my brain because I am trying to scrub this from my brain. She can't
message me, and we can't talk because she cannot know it's me.
I mean, sure, I can be anyone. She doesn't have to know it's me. Hell,
she streams anonymously, so it's the same thing, right?
I shouldn't. I really fucking shouldn't. I— Fuck me. How did this
mouse get into my hand? Why am I clicking Read? What the hell am I
doing? I exit quickly before I can see what she wrote.
“Fuck, fuck, fuck.” I jump out of my chair and toss the mouse anywhere
but in my hand so I don't do something stupid like actually read the damn
thing.
But just like before, I don't know what happens because suddenly I'm
not standing anymore. I'm sitting, and the fucking traitorous mouse is back
in my hand, and I'm clicking on my inbox.
“I'm possessed. I have to be.”
But do possessed people actually know they're possessed? And do they
say it out loud?
My heart batters inside my chest as the page loads, and I swear I'm
about two seconds away from ripping the plug on the computer and
hammering this room shut. My super won't like it, but I don't give a shit. I
need to walk away, and apparently, I can't be trusted to do it myself.
RoPlaying: Hi.
It's a simple message. Totally normal. Nothing to freak out over.
RoPlaying: This is probably totally inappropriate, but I just wanted to
let you know your messages always make me smile. And tonight, I
REALLY needed it. So, thanks.
RoPlaying: You don't have to respond, by the way. I know this is
weird.
I do have to respond. She knows I've seen the messages. She knows I'm
currently online. I'll look like a complete asshole if I don't reply.
Never mind the fact that I want to respond. So fucking badly.
“Keep it simple. Don't fuck this up,” I mutter to myself as I put my
fingers on the keyboard.
I take a deep breath, then type out a message.
ShootsAndScores: You're welcome.
See? Simple. Easy. Totally not weird.
ShootsAndScores: I'm sorry people are creepy to you in the
comments. I hope that's not what upset you tonight.
“No, no, no. Fucking shit,” I curse.
Something is wrong with me. My limbs are operating of their own
accord. Maybe it's like Invasion of the Body Snatchers or something? I
don't know, but I do know this is wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong, and I have
to stop. This cannot go any further.
“Please don't respond,” I whisper, watching the bubbles appear, then
disappear in the chat like they're directly tied to my last breath and the next
message she sends is going to be all the oxygen I need to survive.
RoPlaying: Unfortunately, I'm used to the creeps at this point. I just
ignore them. Tonight, it was something…else.
RoPlaying: I was sort of…ghosted?
“Shit.” I drop my head into my hands, crushing my palms against my eyes,
trying to delete this whole night from my memory.
I'm the fucking worst.
Is that what she thinks happened? That I ghosted her?
I so badly want to type back: “Hey, it's Fitz. I didn't ghost you. My cat
is just a fucking idiot.”
But I can't do that.
Another message pops up, and I lift my head to read it.
RoPlaying: Maybe ghosted isn't the right way to put it.
RoPlaying: But let's just say this night didn't go the way I thought it
would, and the guy I was talking to isn't the guy I thought he was.
ShootsAndScores: I'm sorry. It's never fun when that happens.
RoPlaying: Do you have experience being ghosted?
ShootsAndScores: Honestly, no.
ShootsAndScores: But that's mostly because I don't do much
dating.
RoPlaying: Right. I'm sure you wouldn't be here watching me if you
did.
RoPlaying: Oh my god. That came out SO wrong and insulting.
ShootsAndScores: It's fine. I understood what you meant.
ShootsAndScores: And you're right. If I were in a relationship, I
wouldn't be here. I'm not that kind of guy.
RoPlaying: Well, I suppose that's good to know. It is something I
worry about doing this. I don't ever want to be considered “the other
woman.”
RoPlaying: You were saying you don't date…
ShootsAndScores: I didn't say I don't date, just that I'm not dating
currently. My job just keeps me busy. Lots of travel involved.
RoPlaying: Ah, that makes sense.
RoPlaying: So no secret girlfriend in every city?
“Ha. Hardly,” I murmur.
Some guys definitely do that shit and it makes me fucking rage,
especially because the assholes who do it are usually wearing a wedding
band, but that's not my style at all. I'm a one-woman kind of man. Well,
whenever I can find a woman, that is.
As sad as it is to admit, I don't remember the last time I had someone to
warm my bed. It's been… Fuck. At least a year?
ShootsAndScores: Not even close.
RoPlaying: Good.
RoPlaying: Not that I have any say in the matter anyway.
RoPlaying: You know what? That was out of line. Ignore me. I'm
having an off night.
ShootsAndScores: Because of the guy?
RoPlaying: Yes.
ShootsAndScores: Whoever he is, he's an idiot.
RoPlaying: Right? Biggest dum-dum alive. I'm a catch!
Oh, she has no idea what a catch she really is.
I itch to tell her that. I want to type so many things, want to tell her she
deserves so much in this world. But I can't.
In fact, I need to stop this conversation immediately. It's already gone
too far.
My computer pings again with a new message.
RoPlaying: That sounded conceited. I swear I'm not usually this full
of myself. In fact, in the past, I NEVER believed I was worth much of
anything, but I'm trying not to be that person anymore.
“What the…”
ShootsAndScores: Who the hell told you that you weren't good
enough?
I read my message a few times, hoping like hell I don't come off as some
psycho who is entirely too invested in a stranger's life, but I can't help it.
Who told her that shit? And did she kick them in the nuts? I sure as fuck
hope so.
RoPlaying: Well, nobody SAID it, but it was heavily implied.
RoPlaying: Let's just say striking out tonight isn't the first time I've
had a guy blow me off for someone else.
I really hate that she thinks I blew her off for someone else. I look over at
the someone else again. Carl is awake now, watching me intently with those
damn blue eyes of hers that made me unable to say no to her in the first
place. Right now, they're saying, You love me and you're going to forgive
me for tonight.
“Not a fucking chance,” I tell her. “You're a little shit, and I'm
withholding treats tonight.”
It's an empty threat. I know it, and she does too. She's a spoiled fucking
princess. Hell, I left Rosie to take care of her ass. She's got me wrapped
around her finger.
I'm either a really good cat dad or a complete idiot. Based on what
Rosie is saying to me, I'm leaning toward the latter.
ShootsAndScores: Maybe the guy from tonight has a really good
reason for ghosting you.
RoPlaying: Are you defending him?
ShootsAndScores: No? Just playing devil's advocate.
ShootsAndScores: I mean, I clearly don't know the guy, so how
could I defend him?
Those damn dots dance on the screen again, and a full minute goes by
before she responds.
RoPlaying: That's fair.
RoPlaying: And you're right, maybe he does have a good reason.
But why didn't he give it to me when he had the chance?
ShootsAndScores: He could have been nervous? Or shy? Or just
stupid?
“Monumentally stupid.” I shake my head at myself.
ShootsAndScores: You're a beautiful woman, so maybe you
intimidate him?
RoPlaying: LOL me intimidate someone? Not likely.
RoPlaying: But he is pretty shy…
ShootsAndScores: I know if I saw you out and about, I'd be
completely tongue-tied.
RoPlaying: You're going to make me blush.
ShootsAndScores: Sorry. I think.
RoPlaying: Don't be. I like it.
RoPlaying: But it is getting late, and I should go. I have an early
morning.
RoPlaying: Thank you for chatting with me and letting me vent. I
think I needed it, and all my friends are still out at the bar.
ShootsAndScores: Sure. Glad I could help.
RoPlaying: Maybe we can do this again?
No. Never. We can never, ever do this again.
ShootsAndScores: Of course we can.
“God, you're pathetic.”
Something tells me I should really stop having conversations with
myself, but at this point, it's pretty clear I'm insane, so why stop now?
RoPlaying: Good night. XO
ShootsAndScores: Good night, Ro.
The green icon next to her name goes red, indicating she's away, and I
breathe a sigh of relief.
“I'm fucking screwed.”
Meow.
I glare at Carl. “That's enough from you, cockblocker.”
Meow.
She doesn't care that I took an already shitty situation and made it even
shittier.
I need to fix this. I have to fix this. I'll go to Scout's Sweets tomorrow
and I'll make this better. I'll set the record straight about why I left tonight.
I'll tell her everything and hope like hell she can forgive me.
“I'm going to make this better, Carl. I'll fix it.”
Meow.
She sounds like she doesn't believe me, and I'm not sure I do either.

ROSIE
Four years ago, I realized I was madly in love with my best friend, the guy I
grew up next door to and had known my entire life.
Three years ago, I was ready to tell him I loved him. I just needed to
find the right time. This was big, life-changing. I couldn't just spring it on
him. It had to be right.
Two and a half years ago, everything fell apart when he told me he'd
met the love of his life and was moving out of the country and the lease on
the apartment we shared wasn't going to be renewed.
And as of yesterday, I have officially blown my shot yet again. Fitz has
a girlfriend, or someone waiting for him at home. I'm too late again.
I should have stayed home. I should have stayed in my little cave of
happiness and spent those hours streaming, making money to make my
dream of having my own bakery come true. I should have never thought
asking him out was a good idea.
But I did think it was a good idea, and I got my hopes up that something
might be possible between us. I should have known it would never happen.
I tried to salvage the night by doing some coloring while streaming. I
thought zoning out a bit and making some money doing it would make me
feel better, but it didn't. I talked less than normal, and by the end of the
stream, I was still upset. Even though I promised I wouldn't interact with
my subscribers in my DMs, when I saw the message from
ShootsAndScores, well, I couldn't help myself.
Sure, I could have reached out to Stevie, but I knew she'd still be out
with Greer and everyone else. She doesn't get out much without Macie in
tow, so I wasn't about to ruin her night away. Besides, what's the point of
this new “go-getter” attitude of mine if I'm not willing to make new friends
and do bold things?
I was stunned when he read the message and even more surprised when
he wrote back, but I think talking to him helped. I felt a little better by the
time I went to bed, and then this morning when I got to the truck, I was
feeling a lot lighter, maybe even good. I think it has to do with the
conversation I had with ShootsAndScores.
“Oooh, you're smiling. Who are you thinking about?” Stevie waggles
her brows. “Fitz?”
My smile drops, and she doesn't miss it.
“Oh no.” She sets down the box of spice refills and crosses her arms
over her chest, leaning against the prep table. “You two left last night right
after each other, so I figured you were making a poor attempt at trying to be
discreet, but now I'm worried things didn't go as well as I'd hoped.”
“Things did not go as well as you hoped.”
A frown tugs at the corner of my lips, and Stevie reaches out, squeezing
my forearm.
“I'm sorry,” she says. “What happened?”
“Well, I thought we were hitting it off. We were even joking about what
happened the other morning. Hell, I had literally opened my mouth to ask
him out when…” I trail off, thinking back to the look on his face. That
damn smile. How warm it was, how full of affection…the love.
“Did he say something?” Her back goes straight. “Do something?
Because I swear, I'll call Greer right now and he'll find Fitz and he will
gladly take a skate to his di—”
“No, he didn't do anything.” I smile. “Though I am very happy to know
I have Greer in my corner if that ever did happen.”
“Oh, honey. You don't even know. His gruffness is just a front, and
when he gets mad, he gets mad. He'd do anything to protect the people he
cares about, and that includes you.”
Warmth spreads through me because I know she means it. This little
family they've created here is something special, and I know without a
doubt in my mind I'm included in that too. Sure, it might just be because I
serve the whole team delicious fried dough, but I'm okay with that. It's still
nice to know they have my back if I need it.
“So, you were about to ask him, and then…” Stevie prompts.
I wince. “He got a text or a call. I'm not sure which, but whatever it
was, he got this smile on his face and said he had to go. Actually, he said,
‘Someone needs me.' Then he left.”
Stevie's brows are pulled tightly together, her head tipped to the side as
she stares at me. She doesn't say anything for several moments, so I
continue.
“I'm guessing it was a girlfriend or something. It just felt so…familiar,
you know? Like whoever it was, it was personal.”
“Fitz doesn't have a girlfriend.”
“Maybe it was a booty call?”
Stevie chuckles. “No, that's not Fitz either. He's not that kind of guy.”
“How do you know?”
“Because Greer knows, and that man loves to give me all the good
gossip from the locker room. You'd be really surprised what comes out of
his mouth when he's lying there in a post-orgasm daze.”
Now it's my turn to laugh because I just picture Greer spilling all the
dirty secrets of everyone on the team. Stevie's right—he might come off as
a grump, but deep down, he's a big softie. Hell, one time, I caught him on a
phone call to his mother, and even I about swooned when he told her he
loved her. Sweetest damn thing I've ever heard.
“Maybe it was something else,” Stevie suggests. “Maybe it was a
friend? Or family? I know he has a sister and a few nieces. Could have been
something with them?”
“Yeah, maybe.” I lift my shoulder. “But whatever it was, it was enough
for him to just up and leave with no explanation.”
“But maybe it's a good explanation.”
“That's what the guy online said too.”
“Excuse me? What guy online? Are you talking to someone? Are you
cheating on Fitz?”
I glower at her. “First of all, there is nothing happening between me and
Fitz. Second, no, I'm not talking to someone. He's just…a friend. A new
friend. I just met him last night. Sort of.”
Stevie looks completely unconvinced, and I'm not sure I blame her.
Don't sound exactly sure of myself at the moment.
“Care to elaborate on that very confusing statement?”
I sigh. “He's a subscriber.”
“What? I thought…”
“That I promised to never DM them? I know, but he's not a creep. He
always leaves the sweetest comments. So last night after everything that
happened…” I shrug. “I was feeling lonely. I needed someone to talk to.”
“Um, hello?” She waves at me. “Am I invisible or something?”
“I know I have you, and I totally love you for that, but I also didn't want
to interrupt—”
Stevie holds her hand up. “I swear, if you're about to say something
stupid like interrupt your night with Greer, I will boob punch you.”
I grab said boobs, protecting them because no, thanks. Boob punches
are the worst.
“I wasn't going to say that.”
She lifts both brows.
I groan. “Fine, I totally was. But”—I step away when she moves toward
me—“you guys never get time away to just be you, and when I left, you
were making sex eyes at each other. There was no doubt in my mind you
were going to end up banging in the bar bathroom.”
A slow grin spreads across her face as she gets a faraway look in her
eyes, telling me I am right on the money. She shakes her head, pulling
herself out of her dirty little reminiscence.
“Who cares!” She pushes a finger into her chest. “Friend. There when
you need me, no matter what.”
I sigh. “Yes, I know. And I promise next time, I'll totally bother you
with my trivial issues.” She glares at me but allows me to continue.
“Anyway, this guy was online and said basically the same things you are,
that maybe Fitz left for a good reason and maybe I should hear him out.”
“You totally should. I agree with this dude, whoever he is. What's his
name?”
I shrug. “Not sure. We didn't get that far. I just know his username,
ShootsAndScores.”
Stevie's brows rise. “ShootsAndScores?”
“Yeah? Why are you making that face?”
She shrugs. “No reason. It's just…a little odd, isn't it?”
“No? Should it be? I mean, I just kind of assumed it's because he's a
jock or something.”
“Huh.”
“Huh what?”
“Nothing.” She waves me off, but I have a feeling it's more than
nothing. “So, what'd you two talk about? Anything pervy?”
“It's not all pervy stuff, you know.” She shrugs when I send her a
pointed look. “I just said I was having a bad day and told him a little about
why, and he convinced me I should give Fitz another chance. Then I went to
bed because I had to be up at four for prep and he had an early morning
too.”
Stevie nods a few times, her lips pursed, but she doesn't say anything.
I'm not sure how to gauge her reaction, thinking maybe she's upset that I'm
chatting with some random guy online. So, I ask her that.
“No, no.” She shakes her head. “It's not that. Well, I mean, it's a little
bit that because I worry about your safety, but it's also so common now I'm
not too surprised by it. I just thought…with Fitz and all…”
“I know. I thought with Fitz and all too, but I'm telling you, I think he's
seeing someone else.”
“Maybe. Maybe not. But I agree with this ShootsAndScores guy—you
should give Fitz a chance to explain. He might have a good reason for
leaving like he did.”
I'm sure she's probably right because it doesn't sound like Fitz to have a
secret girlfriend, but who knows?
“I'll talk to him.”
“Yeah? Maybe you can do it at the Halloween party.”
I groan. She's been trying to get me to agree to this damn party for the
last three days.
“You do know Halloween was last week, right?”
“Of course I know. Macie dressed up as Greer, goalie pads and all, and
scored a ton of candy that I'm still snacking on. But the guys are gone, so
we're celebrating when they're home at an adults-only party. And you're
coming.” She sends me a sweet smile.
“I'll think about it.”
“Don't think. Come. It'll be fun!”
“We'll see.” I point a finger at her when she opens her mouth. “That's
all you're getting out of me, so zip it.”
She nods, a grin tugging at her lips. “Where do you want me to put
these extra spices, badass?”
I laugh at the nickname, then direct her to the storage area. We spend
the next several hours slinging coffee and donuts and chatting about
everything other than what happened last night, and I watch the parking lot
the entire time, searching for the hockey player with the missing tooth.
Fitz never shows.
The Comets are on the road and Stevie is driving me nuts complaining
about Greer being gone. I want to grab her by the shoulders and shake her
and ask her how she thinks I feel. The guy I'm totally crushing on might be
seeing someone else, and I don't know because I don't have his contact
info, so all I can do is sit around and wait for him to show up to get any
answers out of him.
It's been a tense few days inside the tiny donut truck, so tonight, I'm
turning to my favorite thing to do to take my mind off things: baking. I have
my laptop set up in the corner of the room, and I'm wearing my wig and
mask as usual. I have my lingerie—a very sexy maroon set that shows off
almost my entire ass every time I bend over to check the cookies—and a
new pair of heels I'm trying out.
I never thought this would be my life, especially having grown up in the
household I did. You kept quiet, and you did what all good little girls are
supposed to do—study hard, go to a college of your parents' choosing, and
marry a man who is going to take care of you. You do everything you're
told and you don't ask questions, so that was what I did. I listened and let
everyone else make my decisions for me. I was going to go to State, and I
was going to find a husband.
The older I got, the less and less I wanted that, but I was too scared to
tell them because I didn't want to disappoint them. So, when Levi came to
me and told me he was leaving and he'd like me to go with him, I did.
I didn't realize that just a few short years later, he'd leave me too.
I try not to think about that as I pull a fresh batch of sea salt caramel
chocolate chip cookies from the oven, making sure to press my ass out as
far as I can to give the camera a good shot. Based on the way my
notifications go nuts, they love it.
I smile to myself. Who would have thought I'd be doing this? Baking
half-naked and getting paid to do it on camera? I sure as hell didn't. I really
didn't expect to enjoy it so much, either. Sure, sometimes the pervy
comments can be taxing, but overall, it's nice. Most of my subscribers are
older single men or widowers who miss having someone around. They
don't want me to do anything sexual; they just want someone to spend time
with. I like being that comfort to them, and I like having their eyes on me.
It's a win-win.
I let the cookies rest as I strut back toward my laptop and grin into the
camera.
“How's everyone doing tonight?”
I keep my eye on the comments, knowing exactly what name I'm
hoping pops up.
I haven't spoken to ShootsAndScores since the other night, though not
for lack of wanting to reach out. I've just been swamped with classes. Who
knew going to college and juggling not one, but two jobs would be such a
damn struggle? I'm more tired than normal, but I know in the long run
when I'm operating my own bakery, this is going to pay off big.
Several answers come through on the chat. Some are polite, and some
are not so great. I do my best to ignore those, but one catches my eye.
BallSoH@rd: You're fat but you got some great tits. Show them to us! My
cock is aching for you.
I grind my teeth, trying not to let the comment get to me. I mean, this
person is literally paying to be here. They must like what they see enough,
right?
Another comment pops up.
ShootsAndScores: @BallSoH@rd, your cock is really going to be aching
when I knee you in the balls.
I laugh.
“I'm not sure you're supposed to knee your fellow man in the balls,
ShootsAndScores.”
ShootsAndScores: Two things…
ShootsAndScores: If he deserves it, fuck yes you can.
ShootsAndScores: And that's no man. A man doesn't treat a woman like
that.
His responses get several positive reactions in the chat.
In real life? His words go straight between my legs.
I don't respond to him out loud again, mostly because if I say
something, I'm nearly positive there's no way I'll be able to mask the lust in
my voice. Ridiculous since I don't know this guy, but still.
I stream for another thirty minutes or so and make another batch of
cookies, then decide to call it a night. I have some reading to do for my
economics class, and I'm not looking to fall behind when the semester just
started.
“Thanks for joining me tonight. I won't be back tomorrow, but I'll be
around on Sunday.”
I wait for a comment from ShootsAndScores since he always sends one
when I end my streams.
A minute goes by.
Then another.
When I finally hit three, I accept that he's not going to say anything, and
my shoulders slump in defeat. Maybe things were too weird the other night?
I don't know, but now I have two guys ghosting me. Sure,
ShootsAndScores is just a client, but it still stings.
I blow the camera a kiss, then cover the lens with my hand as I turn off
the stream.
A minute later, a message pops up.
ShootsAndScores: Evening, Ro.
Well, well, well, maybe this night isn't over yet.
Homework can wait.

FITZ
It's official: I'm the fucking worst.
Practice ran long, I was trapped in the doc's office for thirty minutes,
and then I got sent down to press and ended up spending entirely too
fucking long standing in front of a camera getting my picture taken about
ten billion times.
By the time I got out, the truck was closed for the day, and I knew I was
screwed, especially since we left for a road trip bright and early the next
morning. We got five out of six possible points, and now we're on the plane
back to North Carolina. I'm itching for two things: a strawberry smoothie
and to see Rosie so I can fix things between us because I know she must
still be upset.
I talked myself out of asking Greer to ask Stevie for Rosie's number
about ten different times. The most recent was in the locker room before we
boarded the plane. When Greer chucked his helmet across the room after
the shootout loss, I figured it probably wasn't the best moment.
Now, he's passed out beside me, and I have my phone out angled away
from him, Rosie's stream playing in my ears. She's currently pulling a fresh
batch of cookies from the oven, and when she bends over, I can see the
edges of her ass cheeks. I have to fight back a moan at the sight.
She hasn't spoken for a half hour, and I wonder if it has anything to do
with that asshole's comments. It's not the first time someone's been a dick
to her and I'm sure it won't be the last, but I fucking hate that I can't do
anything about it. I can't remember the last time I was so fired up about
something. Maybe when Greer told me about that piece of shit who
cornered Stevie at Slapshots and tried touching her?
I wasn't lying to Hayes when I said I've never been in a fight, but that
only extends to the ice. Off it, I've had my fair share of tussles, especially in
high school when guys would try to mess around with my sister. Hell, I
even missed two weeks of hockey when Richie Johnson slapped her ass in
the middle of the cafeteria. It was worth every fucking minute of riding the
bench.
Rosie keeps her video going for another few minutes, then signs off for
the night. I miss her the second the screen goes black, and I want her to
know she has someone in her corner. Before I can overthink it too much, I
pull up the chat and shoot her a message.
ShootsAndScores: Evening, Ro.
RoPlaying: Hey there. : )
RoPlaying: How's your night?
ShootsAndScores: Long and hard.
That's not a lie, but what I don't tell her is that we lost in overtime and I'm
kicking myself because it was my fault. I lost my edge and went down,
giving Seattle the opportunity for a breakaway in three-on-three hockey.
They ripped it past Greer, and that was the end of the game. If I had just
kept my stride, we'd have been fine. We lost a point thanks to me.
I'm not sure what it means that when I've had a rough night, she's the
first person I want to talk to, but I try not to think about it.
RoPlaying: Well, that sounds like a fun night to me. ; )
ShootsAndScores: Oh god, I didn't mean…
ShootsAndScores: Anyway, I meant what I said. That guy deserves
a kick in the nuts. I'd be more than happy to do it for you.
RoPlaying: And take away all my fun? Now that's rude. *pouts*
ShootsAndScores: I see those types of comments roll in
sometimes. The number of times I've had to bite my tongue so I
don't go off on people… Well, it's a lot.
ShootsAndScores: I'm sorry you have to deal with that.
RoPlaying: It's fine. I'm still getting paid either way. I mean, at least
they compliment my great cans while being colossal dicks.
ShootsAndScores: You signed up to stream. You didn't sign up to
be treated like a piece of fucking meat. Guys are pigs.
RoPlaying: Does that include you?
Fuck. It includes me in ways she doesn't even know.
ShootsAndScores: Sometimes, yes.
RoPlaying: Wow. I'm surprised by your honest answer. Most guys
would pretend they're perfect only to reveal later they were a liar the
whole time.
ShootsAndScores: Experience in that?
RoPlaying: Years and years ago. I had an ex in high school who
was very…friendly with everyone.
I gnash my teeth, trying my best to hold back all the bad words that want to
flow out of me.
ShootsAndScores: Fuck that guy.
RoPlaying: Lots of people did.
RoPlaying: LOL Sorry. Easy joke.
RoPlaying: But, yeah, fuck that guy. He didn't deserve me then, and
he damn sure doesn't deserve me now.
I love that she knows her worth, and I hope she always sticks to her guns on
that.
RoPlaying: Thank you, by the way, for saying something in the chat.
I think it helps when others comment back about what assholes
people can be. I try to block them whenever I see something, but it
moves so fast I don't always get the chance.
ShootsAndScores: I'm always there to back you up.
ShootsAndScores: Well, when my schedule allows me to catch a
stream, that is.
RoPlaying: You travel for work a lot, then, huh? Do you like it?
ShootsAndScores: I love it. I wouldn't trade the job for anything.
RoPlaying: What do you do?
“Shit. Fuck. Shit.”
“Shh!” Hayes says from behind me. “People are trying to sleep,
asshole.”
I glance over my shoulder to make sure he can't see my screen, but I
don't have anything to worry about. He's currently sporting a white eye
mask that says Go Fuck Yourself and his head is bent at the most
uncomfortable angle. Ford, the new guy on the team, is sitting next to him.
He's wearing headphones and his face is buried in his iPad, so I don't think
I have anything to worry about there either.
I turn my attention back to my phone, where another message is waiting
for me.
RoPlaying: Sorry. You don't have to answer that. I didn't mean to
pry. It's just, you know so much about me from streaming…
ShootsAndScores: Are you guilt-tripping me?
RoPlaying: Maybe a little?
ShootsAndScores: That's okay. I'll allow it.
Honestly, I'd allow her to do just about anything she wanted.
ShootsAndScores: I work in sports.
RoPlaying: Hence the name.
RoPlaying: Agent?
ShootsAndScores: Something like that.
RoPlaying: Do you work with hockey players at all?
I sit forward in my seat, my heart hammering so fucking loud I have a
feeling it's going to stir more than one guy awake.
Why the hell would she ask me that? I didn't give anything away, did I?
Calm down. She's probably just asking because the team is at the damn
truck all the time. She knows hockey players. It's cool. You're cool.
I choose my next words very carefully.
ShootsAndScores: I know a few.
RoPlaying: Me too!
RoPlaying: I mean, not to brag or anything, but I actually know a
whole team of them.
RoPlaying: Wow. That sounds like they're running a train on me or
something.
My breath gets stuck in my lungs, and I can't breathe. I'm wheezing, my
whole body burning with the inability to properly pull in air.
Hayes kicks at the back of my seat. “Dude, if you're going to die, do it
quietly, huh?”
I don't even bother responding to him.
RoPlaying: OH MY GOD. I don't know why I said that. Ignore me.
RoPlaying: I know them from my job. My other job. I bake. I LOVE
baking. It's my favorite thing.
ShootsAndScores: Even more than streaming?
RoPlaying: Oh, definitely. I mean, don't get me wrong, I love to
stream and do this. It's fun and it allows me to explore myself in
ways I never knew I wanted to, so how could I not love it? But it's not
my passion. My passion is making delicious sweets. I'd love to open
my own bakery someday.
ShootsAndScores: I think that's incredible. You should do it.
RoPlaying: Yeah? I think so too.
RoPlaying: Do you like sweets? What's your favorite kind? I'll bake
it next time so you can watch. : )
My cock aches at the idea of watching Rosie bake my favorite sweet. I can
just picture her in nothing but an apron, smears of flour and icing all over
her body as she whips up something with strawberries.
I try to wipe the image from my head, not because I don't want to think
about it but because if I keep thinking about it, there's a chance I could
blow my load without ever touching my cock.
ShootsAndScores: Strawberry donuts.
RoPlaying: Really? That's so strange. That guy from the other night,
the one who ghosted me, he's a big strawberry nut too. I know
because he ALWAYS orders two strawberry donuts. I don't know
where it all goes, though, because the man certainly doesn't look like
he eats two donuts every day.
RoPlaying: Sorry. I'm rambling. I do that sometimes.
ShootsAndScores: Don't apologize. It's cute.
RoPlaying: Okay, this is getting weird. HE said that to me too.
“Fuckfuckfuckfuck.” It comes out all one word, and I can't stop chanting it.
Why? Why would I say that? And why would I tell her strawberry
donuts are my favorite? I'm being so fucking obvious I might as well just
confess who I am right now.
ShootsAndScores: He sounds like a cool guy.
“Fucking really? That's what you come up with?”
Another kick to the back of my chair from Hayes. Beside me, Greer rips
his own eye mask off and whirls around in his seat, then smacks Hayes on
the side of his head.
Hayes sits up with a glare. “Hey, man. What the fuck?”
“What the fuck is right. He's not even being that loud, and you keep
fucking kicking the seat because you're being a little bitch about a tiny
amount of noise. Shut up and deal with it like the rest of us or I swear to
fucking god, I'm going to break your legs off and beat you with them
myself.”
“That's quite the vivid image,” Ford mumbles.
Greer turns his icy stare to the new guy, who just holds his hands up in
the air.
“I'm being quiet,” he promises.
“Good. Now stop kicking the seat and go to sleep, Princess.”
Hayes doesn't say anything. He just slips the mask back down his face
and settles into his seat.
Greer flips around and falls back into his chair, and suddenly I'm the
one he's scowling at.
“Shut the fuck up or I'll make you sit with Miller next time,” he tells me
flatly.
“Hey, I heard that!” the guy in question calls from the back of the plane,
earning himself a rousing chorus of “Shut up, Miller!” from just about
everyone.
Greer smirks and nods toward my phone. “What are you doing over
there? Watching porn?”
“I'm minding my own business.”
He shrugs. “Fair enough. Just keep it down.”
I nod, and he returns to his previous position, eye mask in place. It's not
even thirty seconds before he's snoring softly beside me.
RoPlaying: He is when he's not ditching me.
RoPlaying: Anyway, I don't want to talk about him tonight. I'm still
upset because he still hasn't explained what happened.
ShootsAndScores: I'm sorry. He sounds like a jerk.
RoPlaying: He really isn't.
RoPlaying: At least I don't think so.
RoPlaying: I'm going to give him another chance whenever he gets
back.
ShootsAndScores: Back?
RoPlaying: He travels for work a lot too.
RoPlaying: Wow. I just realized the two of you have a lot in
common.
ShootsAndScores: Sounds like we're both cool guys.
RoPlaying: That was terribly lame, and I loved it.
RoPlaying: Anyway, thanks for sticking up for me tonight. I like
having you there to have my back.
ShootsAndScores: Happy to be of service.
RoPlaying: If I can ever be of service, just let me know. ; )
Does she mean…
I shake away the thought.
RoPlaying: Good night. XO
ShootsAndScores: Good night, Ro.
I click my screen off and set my phone against my chest. I close my eyes
and am almost asleep when something hits me.
I pull the streaming site back up and navigate to our chat.
ShootsAndScores: In a totally non-pervy way, you're gorgeous and
worth watching…and not just because of your great cans.
I turn my phone off before I can see if she responds. This time, when I close
my eyes, I go right to sleep…and I totally dream of Rosie.
“But, Mom! Puh-lease! Pretty, pretty please!”
“No.” Stevie shakes her head. “It's a school night. You don't need to be
staying the night with Aunt Scout and Uncle Miller on a school night. You
basically spent all summer with them. You can survive an entire week at
home.”
“But they have a puppy!” Macie, Stevie's young daughter, crosses her
arms over her chest and sticks her bottom lip out. “I want a puppy.”
“You can get a puppy when you learn to not leave your backpack in the
middle of the living room every day. Dogs are a big responsibility. How am
I supposed to trust you with one when you don't even clean up your own
messes?”
“Because a dog is different!” The kid looks over at Greer. “Tell her,
Greer!”
He holds his hands up. “I'm not getting in the middle of this.” He leans
over to me. “Mostly because I'm totally on team Macie, and I'd rather not
go without sex for agreeing with the kid over Stevie.”
“I heard that.” Stevie glares at her boyfriend, then turns back to her
daughter. “Tell you what—we'll talk about it when you're twelve, how's
that?”
“Twelve? Twelve? That's forever away!”
It's not, but I'm sure to her, it feels like it. Thing is, I have a feeling
Stevie is going to cave well before then, especially if Greer has anything to
say about it.
Stevie pinches the bridge of her nose. “Macie…”
“Mom…” she mimics.
“I don't have time for this. I need to go help Rosie,” her mother says,
cutting her one last glare before turning and walking away, putting a pin in
the conversation.
The kid lets out a sigh, then flops down on the picnic bench next to
Greer. She looks up at me with sad eyes. “Do you have any pets?”
“I do.”
“What kind?”
“A shithead cat.”
She narrows her eyes. “You can't say shithead, but I promise not to tell
my mom.”
“Um, you just said shithead,” Greer points out.
Her eyes widen. “Oh crap.”
“You're not supposed to say crap either.”
I swear her eyes get even bigger, and I have to tuck my lips together so I
don't laugh because she looks like she might cry.
“But if you promise to cool it with the puppy begging, I won't tell your
mom.”
“Really?”
Greer nods. “Yeah, but mostly because I want a puppy too, and if you
keep it up, we'll never get one. Your mother is stubborn.”
Macie rolls her eyes. “I know. She always tells me I got that from her.”
The goalie reaches over and tugs on her braids. “You did, and it's my
favorite thing about both of you.”
She smiles up at him, then looks over at me. “Can I meet your shithead
cat?”
I shrug. “Sure. Why not?”
“Yes!” She fist-pumps the air, then jumps off the bench, racing toward
her mother, who is back inside the truck, rushing around with Rosie as they
try to placate the line of hungry people. “Mom! Fitz said I could meet his
cat!”
Stevie glowers our way, and Greer cowers under her heated stare.
We got in late last night and I crashed as soon as I walked through the
door. I didn't even cuddle with Carl like I usually do, something she was
apparently very unhappy about this morning based on the fact that she
ignored me when I was getting ready.
I was surprised to find Greer pulling into the parking lot of Scout's
Sweets at the same time I did. I wanted to beeline right for Rosie and
explain to her what happened at Slapshots, but I don't want to do it in front
of Greer.
So instead, I've just been sitting here waiting for the right moment to
talk with her.
“So, what's up with you being here this morning?” he asks. “I figured
you'd be at home being a loner or something.”
“Um, donuts. Obviously.”
He nods a few times. “Right. Obviously.” He slides his eyes toward the
truck where Rosie is currently grinning at a customer, listening intently to
whatever they say before throwing her head back on a laugh. “And it has
nothing to do with her, right?”
I whip my head back. “Excuse me? Why would you say that?”
“Just a hunch. You two looked awfully cozy at Slapshots right before
we left.”
“You were watching me at Slapshots? Didn't your mom ever tell you
it's not nice to stare?”
“First, leave my beautiful angel of a mother out of this conversation.”
He glowers at me. “Second, I was paying attention, not staring.”
“You know, every day you say something that makes me even more
surprised you got Stevie to fall in love with you.”
He reaches down and grabs himself between the legs. “It's my huge
dick, not my pretty words that did it.”
“More like you are a huge dick.”
He grins. “And proud of it.” The smile slips just as quickly as it
appeared because of course it did because it's Greer and smiling is so not
his thing. “Now tell me: do you have a thing for the hot baker or not?”
It's my turn to glare at him, and I'll give him credit because the dude is
no fool. He knows why I'm glaring.
“So you do have a thing for her, then. Stevie had a suspicion, but she
wasn't totally sold, especially after Rosie said something about you bailing
on her.”
I groan. “Stevie knows?”
He shrugs. “Not formally.”
“Good. She better not find out.”
“Oooh. Are we sharing secrets?” Rosie falls onto the bench across from
us. “Who are they about? Tell me everything.”
My heart begins to hammer wildly in my chest. Where the hell did she
come from? And did she hear any of that? Based on the way she's staring at
us both with wide, curious eyes, I'm going with no.
“Hey, Ro,” I say to her.
She narrows her eyes. “Ro?”
Oh fuck.
“Sorry, I meant Rosie. I don't know why I said that.” I swear my face is
on fire as her green eyes bore into me.
Greer presses his hand to my shoulder. “I'm going to go check on Stevie
now that the line has died down.” He winks at Rosie. “Ro.” He walks
behind her, pointing at her, then to me, then he makes a circle with his right
hand and pokes his left index finger in and out of it, all while grinning like
an idiot.
I want so badly to flip him off, but I know that's going to make
everything entirely too fucking obvious, so I don't.
She shrugs. “It's fine. I've never had a nickname before. I like it.”
“Nobody has ever called you Ro before?”
“Well, they sort of have.” She doesn't elaborate on that, but she doesn't
know she doesn't have to. “I've just always been Rosie. Even my…” She
pauses, then swallows thickly. “Just Rosie.”
I nod. “Well, Ro it is, then.”
She grins, and I realize at this moment I missed that grin over the last
few days more than I missed my strawberry smoothie and donut fix, and
that's saying something.
“So, Fitz…” She links her hands together, then rests her arms atop the
table, leaning closer to me.
“So, Ro…” I mirror her movements, loving how much sweeter she
smells the closer I get.
The corners of her mouth tug up, but it doesn't last. “Why'd you ditch
me at Slapshots?”
I sputter, completely caught off guard by her blunt question. She just
went right for the jugular. Rip the Band-Aid off and whatnot.
“Um…” I reach up with my hand, lifting the hat I'm wearing and
running my hand through my hair, then tugging the cap back down, this
time backward. “I had to get home to someone.”
“Yeah, you said that. I'm assuming they're okay. I mean, you were off
playing hockey and stuff. If it was serious, you wouldn't have been.”
“Yeah, everything is okay.”
“Oh. Good. I'm glad.”
She somehow looks upset by my answer, and I hate that. I hate that she
doesn't like it. I hate that there are probably a million questions and
scenarios running through her head.
I clear my throat, which suddenly feels so fucking dry, then sit forward
once more. Rosie looks up at me with unsure eyes.
“Do you want to know what I was doing?” I ask.
She twists her lips, flicking her eyes away before looking back at me.
She nods once. “Please.”
“My cat.”
Her brows slide together, a deep wrinkle forming between her eyes.
“Huh?”
“Carl, my cat. For some reason, she loves sneaking into my pantry and
sitting on the bread loaf in there. Don't ask me why because I don't know.
She's weird. Anyway, I have this app on my phone that shows me a live
feed of my place while I'm away, and I got a notification that she was in the
camera's view. I saw her go into the pantry. It wouldn't be a big deal if the
latch didn't stick so badly, which is why I never close the door fully. So,
when it shut behind her…”
“You had to go rescue her.”
I nod. “Exactly. I'm sure I could have explained that the other night, but
I was worried because she's scared of the dark, so I just…”
“Left.”
Another nod. “Yeah. I'm, uh, sorry about that. I'm kind of clueless
sometimes in social settings. I guess it's the loner in me.”
Rosie doesn't say anything. She just stares at me. It's not a blank stare
or an angry stare. It's just…a stare, and it has me twitching in my seat
because I don't have a damn clue what it means.
“Um, Rosie?”
“I have so many questions,” she blurts out. “I'm trying to figure out
where to start.”
“I'll answer them all.”
“Okay…” She leans forward, counting off the first question on her
finger. “One: your female cat's name is Carl?”
I chuckle because I knew this question would be first. It's always
everybody's first one.
“Yes. Her name is Carl. I found her one night when I was out for a
walk.” Before finding Rosie's stream, I used to take them at night all the
time when I couldn't figure out how to calm my brain down. For obvious
reasons, I don't tell her that. “I saw this cat down in the alley, just a little
thing, maybe six months old and skinny as hell. It had part of a Styrofoam
cup from Carl's Burgers around its neck. The cat was trying to get it off and
couldn't. It was so scared it scratched me all over the damn place when I
tried to pick it up. When I got hold of the thing, I got the trash off, but I just
couldn't leave it on the street alone. I took it home and let it stay the night,
then took it to the vet the next day. That's when I learned it was female. I
tried to change her name to something else, but she refused to respond to
anything other than Carl, so it just stuck.”
Rosie's grinning by the time my story is over, and… “Are you crying?”
“What? No!” She swipes at her obviously wet eyes. “Shut up. You're
crying.”
I laugh. “I'm not right now, but I totally did then.”
“Did you really?”
That same blush from before creeps back in. “Yeah. Now shut up.”
Rosie wipes at her eyes again with a sniffle. “Okay. That story is really
sweet and also strange, but I have more questions. So, number two: Carl is
afraid of the dark?”
“Oh yeah, big-time. She hates it. I keep a night-light on in every room
so if she's up roaming the apartment, she doesn't get scared.”
Her mouth drops open.
“What?” I ask.
“That is…”
“Weird? Yeah, I know.”
“Sweet, Fitz. It's incredibly sweet.”
I shift around, trying really fucking hard not to let that godforsaken
redness creep back into my face.
“Question three: You have a camera for your cat?”
“Sure do.” I take my phone out and pull up the feed, then slide the
device across the table. I point to the screen where Carl is sitting on her
tower, lazing around in the morning sun. “See.”
“Aww, she's so cute.”
I smile like a proud dad. “She's a handful.” And a total cockblock.
“Clearly.” She gives my phone back. “That's…cute.” She winks. “All
right. I forgive you, then.”
“Wait—no questions about why she likes to lie on the bread?”
She shrugs. “Bread is soft. Totally makes sense.”
I laugh. “Right. Of course.”
Quiet falls over us. It's almost awkward, but not quite there.
“So…” I start, trying to preserve the moment as long as I can. “Are we
good?”
Rosie nods. “We're good. Just maybe next time give a girl a short
description of why you're leaving so she doesn't think you're running off to
a girlfriend or secret wife or booty call.”
A look crosses her features, one I know…one I've seen from several of
the guys on the team before, especially when someone flirts with their girl.
It's jealousy.
And a little worry.
“I don't.”
“Huh?”
“I don't have one, a girlfriend or secret wife or booty call.”
“Oh. Okay.”
“Okay?”
She bobs her head up and down slowly. “Okay. Good.”
Good.
I don't know what it means. I don't know what I want it to mean, but I
do know it can't mean anything.
“Are you going to the Halloween party tomorrow?” she asks.
I suppress a groan. I hate going to parties, and I really hate going to
costume parties. But I find myself nodding anyway. “Yes. I have to. I'm
pretty sure if I don't, Lowell might rip my balls off, and since I'm kind of a
big fan of those, I'd rather that not happen.”
“Nah. He's getting soft in his old age, especially with that adorable baby
of his and now that Hollis just had their second baby.”
She's not lying there. I used to hear rumors of Lowell and his one-timer
ways, but now he's fully committed and settled down, officially a dad of
two.
“Dammit, Greer, did you put her up to it?”
We both look to the donut truck, where Stevie is looking at Greer like
she's about ten seconds away from murdering him. He has his palms up in
the air, doing his best to look innocent, though there is no doubt in my mind
he's not.
“Me? Never?” He bats his lashes, but she doesn't buy it, and I don't
blame her.
Rosie hitches her thumb over her shoulder. “I should get back before I
have to help Stevie bury a body.”
“You'd do that?”
“In a damn heartbeat.” Rosie rises from the table but doesn't make a
move to walk away. “Thanks for explaining things to me. I look forward to
hearing more stories about what a troublemaker Carl is.”
“Wait until I tell you about the time she snuck out and my neighbor,
Miss Drake, brought her back wearing nothing but a G-string bikini. She's
eighty.” I shudder just thinking about it.
Rosie laughs. “It's a date, then.”
She gives me a small wave before sauntering back to the donut truck,
and I'm ashamed to admit I watch her ass the entire time. I mean, can I
really be blamed? Especially when the material hugs all of her curves like it
was made specifically for her?
When she's about to step back inside, I realize something.
“Hey, Ro!” She spins around, her brows raised in a silent question. “Are
you going?” She tips her head to the side. “The Halloween party.”
Please say yes.
“I'm not sure.” She tucks a strand of hair behind her ear with a grin, and
it takes everything I have not to march over to her and pull it loose again so
I can feel it between my fingertips. “Maybe.”
“Well, then maybe I'll see you there.”
That small smile? It turns into a full-on beam.
Maybe this party won't be so bad after all.

ROSIE
RoPlaying: So, I finally talked to The Guy.
ShootsAndScores: Yeah? How did that go?
RoPlaying: Good. Really good, actually. He gave me a totally legit
reason for leaving like he did.
ShootsAndScores: And you believe him?
RoPlaying: I might be crazy for it, but I do. If you knew him, you'd
understand. He's just this…well, really sweet guy, so I can see it.
ShootsAndScores: Well, good. I'm glad you got it sorted out and
you're back on good terms.
RoPlaying: Me too.
RoPlaying: I think I may have you to thank for it.
ShootsAndScores: Me? Why?
RoPlaying: You convinced me to give him a shot at explaining
himself. So, yeah, thanks for that.
ShootsAndScores: Well, then you're welcome.
RoPlaying: You're a good friend.
When he doesn't respond after two full minutes, I click my screen off and
slip my phone back into my pocket. I might be a lovesick fool or the most
gullible person on the planet, but Fitz's reasoning for ditching me at
Slapshots was the sweetest thing ever.
It was so…Fitz.
He left to rescue his cat who is afraid of the dark because he didn't want
her to freak out? He may as well have been holding a lighter under my dress
because I swear my panties melted right off.
“Oooh. You look like you're thinking of something panty-melting. Tell
me.”
Stevie rests her arms on the countertop beside me. The morning rush is
gone, and we're all out of things to do until it picks back up at eleven when
people come in for their midday sugar coma.
“Fitz rescued his female cat who is afraid of the dark and likes to sit on
bread and is named Carl, and I'm pretty sure it makes him the most
beautiful man alive.”
When Stevie doesn't say anything, I peek over at her.
“Did you hear what I just said? Fitz rescu—”
“I heard what you said. I also heard what you said yesterday when you
told me this same story.”
“So why aren't you swooning?”
“Oh, I am, because that is sweet as hell, but I also don't want to be
creeping on your man.”
“My man?” I scoff. “He's not my man.”
“But he could be.” She bounces her brows up and down a few times.
“Maybe even tonight at the party.”
“Ugh, the party. I still don't know if I'm going.”
“What!” she explodes. “Of course you're going. You have to.”
I don't have to, but I'd be lying if I said a little part of me didn't want to
go. Fitz seemed excited by the idea of me going, and that made me excited
about the idea of going. And who knows? Maybe this could be our shot. A
loud party with flowing drinks, something to help ease the tension.
“I don't have a costume,” I complain.
“Just wear your streaming getup. It's not like anyone is going to know
it's you. Nobody knows you stream, right?”
I shake my head. “I haven't told anyone.”
Not because I'm ashamed of what I do, because I'm not. It just hasn't
naturally come up in any conversation. And besides, when people ask me
why I do it, I'm not sure I'm ready to explain the whole paying-for-school
aspect of it because then I'd need to explain why I'm going back. I'm not
ready to divulge that information to Scout yet.
“Then wear that. It's sexy and it's fun. And it shows off the incredible
curves you have.” She bumps her shoulder against mine.
I used to be ashamed of my curves. I hated that my boobs were big and
my ass spilled over the seats at restaurants. I especially hated the folds on
my belly every time I bent over and the stretchmarks that lined my skin. I
remember a time when I wore baggy clothes and gym shorts, doing
anything and everything I could to not have something clinging to me.
Then, after everything that happened with Levi and I vowed to never be
that meek little girl again, I did something daring—I wore a shirt that was
actually my size. Sure, I still had my saggy basketball shorts on, but it was a
huge feat for me. It took time, but eventually, I got to a point where it felt
wrong to wear something that didn't show off my body. Now, I'm proud of
what I'm rocking, rolls and all.
“Whatever you wear, it's going to have Fitz drooling, I know that.”
“And what if I show up to this party and he doesn't recognize me and
then we spend the entire night not talking or being awkward around one
another?”
“Well, there is no doubt in my mind Fitz is going to be awkward
because that's just how that adorable shy boy is, but I know you're not
going to be. It'll be a total movie moment: you walking in looking all hot,
the music coming to a dramatic pause, and then he'll see you and you'll fall
into each other's arms and ask Lowell to use one of his rooms.”
“Not one of his rooms,” I remind her. “It's a rental.”
“Even hotter because you don't have to worry about leaving the room
all messy. Actually, maybe I can sneak off with Greer…” The wheels start
turning in her head, and I have no doubt she's already plotting ways to get
him up to a room—not that she'll have to work hard. Greer is obsessed with
her, and he's not afraid to show it no matter who is watching.
She gives herself a shake. “Anyway, that's what's going to happen.
Mark my words.”
“Oh, yes, I'll just start holding my breath now.” I roll my eyes. “Don't
we have work to be doing?”
She groans. “Yes, but I don't want to do it. I hate working here.”
“So why do you?”
She twists her lips back and forth a few times before saying, “Because
it's easy, and sometimes easy is nice. But what I really want is to do
something else, maybe even teach.”
“You want to be a teacher?”
“I think so.” She bites on her bottom lip. “Do you think that's crazy?”
“What? No! I think it's a great idea! I mean, they're tragically
underpaid, so that part sucks, but I think it would be a good fit for you.”
“Really? Because I do too. I don't think I've done a bad job with Macie,
so working with other kids could be fun.”
“I think it's the perfect job for you.”
This is it, Rosie. This is your chance to tell Stevie about wanting to open
your own bakery.
“And this is the perfect job for you, you know. I don't think Scout or I
tell you enough, but we really appreciate what you've done here, stepping
up to give her room to fulfill her writing dreams. It means a lot, and you
mean a lot to us.”
Guilt eats at me more and more with every word that leaves her mouth.
I love this place. I love Scout and I love Stevie too, but making donuts isn't
my dream. I want to do more. I want to make more. Hell, I might even want
to cater some events.
I can't tell Stevie that now though, not when she's just said all these
incredible things about me. It'll only make her sad.
“Thanks,” I say instead. “You two mean a lot to me too.”
She smiles, then bumps my shoulder again. “All right. Enough sappy
shit. Let's get this place ready before all the fancy business boys come for
their midday hit of caffeine so we can get out early and get ready for the
party tonight.”
For the first time since she asked me to go, I'm actually looking forward
to the party because I have a feeling Fitz will be there, and tonight, I plan to
tell him just how I feel.
“Great. Now I'm the weirdo who showed up to the party in an Uber instead
of driving because she got nervous and did three shots before she left her
apartment.”
“Um, ma'am, this is an Uber, not a confessional, and I have other rides
to pick up.”
I wince. “Right. Sorry,” I tell my driver. “Thank you for the ride. Five
stars.”
“Fucking better be,” the guy mutters as I push the door open and climb
out of the old Honda Civic.
I shut the door, he peels off, and I think for a second about removing
one star just because, but I know he doesn't really deserve it. I mean, I did
just sit in the back of his car muttering to myself for a full ten minutes.
I give him five stars and a hefty tip, then slip my phone back into my
purse before I do something dumb like read over my messages with
ShootsAndScores again. He still hasn't responded from earlier, and for
some reason, it's not sitting right with me.
I do my best to brush it aside and focus on the here and now—this damn
Halloween party. I've never been a big party person, and this one has
butterflies swirling in my belly because I'm not sure what to expect. Fitz
seemed excited about the idea of me coming, but I wish I knew why. As a
friend? As potentially more? I don't know, and not knowing is killing me.
“Well, there is only one way to find out,” I say.
I stare up at the sprawling mansion Lowell rented for the party. I can
hear the music from out here, and I just know it's going to be a madhouse
when I get inside. I mean, it's a bunch of professional hockey players; they
aren't exactly known for keeping things tame.
I blow out a breath, pull my skirt up, and make my way up the stairs. I
don't bother knocking—it's not like anyone could hear me anyway—and
push the door open. I'm immediately assaulted by the thumping bass of
whatever rap song is blaring through the speakers. It's so loud I can feel it
in my chest, and I already regret coming.
“This is so not my scene,” I murmur as I wade through the groups of
partygoers.
There are so many people, many more than there are on the team, that's
for sure. They're all dancing or talking, and some are even kissing. It's
exactly what I imagined a party with a bunch of hot hockey players would
look like—pure chaos.
“Hey! You made it!”
I spin to find Stevie walking toward me, a black and orange cup in each
hand. She's decked out head to toe as Elsa from Frozen. She wraps me in a
hug, and it's apparent I'm not the only one who has already had something
to drink tonight. I can smell the booze wafting off her.
“You look great!” she shouts in my ear, giving me a big smile. “Fitz is
going to love it.” She points to the room behind her. “He's in there
somewhere. Last I saw he was on the couch being a party pooper.” She juts
her bottom lip out, and I laugh.
“You look amazing, too. I love the wig.” I finger the braid that's
hanging over her shoulder.
“Isn't it great? Greer said he already has plans for later, something about
acting out a dirty Disney version, one where I'm on my knees and he's the
evil guy who is going to spank me instead of trying to take over my
kingdom, and I cannot wait.” Her eyes widen. “Oh my god, pretend I didn't
say that. I'm drunk.”
“You don't say,” I tease. “Where's everyone else?”
She nods toward another side of the house. “Lots of them are over there.
Some are in the kitchen, a few in the basement. I think they're playing strip
poker? I don't know. Oh!” She smacks her forehead with her wrist, and
whatever alcoholic beverage she has in her cup sloshes over the side. If any
gets on her, she doesn't seem to care. “I almost forgot. We need your
phone.”
“My phone?”
“Yep. Them's the rules, straight from Lowell's mouth. No phones
because it means evidence, and if things go awry, as captain, he's the one in
trouble.”
“Okay…” I dig into the small clutch I brought, then hand it over.
She tosses it into a bucket near the door that's already overflowing with
other devices, then leans in close to me. “Don't tell Lowell, but I totally
have my phone on me. I have a kid, dammit! I have to know if she's okay.”
I mimic zipping my lips. “I won't say a word.”
She winks and bumps me with her hip. “Come on. Let's go show
everyone how hot you look.”
I shake my head at her, letting her lead the way.
“Hey, guys, Rosie's here!” she announces to the room.
I stop dead in my tracks when I see what's before me.
“Is that… Is that Collin's ass?”
Stevie barks out a loud laugh, pulling just about everyone's attention
since the music is a little quieter back here.
“It's beautiful, isn't it?” says Harper, who, based on the mask that's
pushed up on the top of her head, is dressed as Michael Myers. She smacks
her husband's exposed cheeks.
“Hey!” Collin whirls around, glaring at her. “What'd I tell you about
that, woman?”
“That I'm your wife and I'm legally allowed to smack your ass?” she
challenges.
He shakes his head, pretending to be mad, but it's obvious he's enjoying
her ogling him.
“Wait. If you're Michael, then he's…”
“Laurie Strode circa Halloween II. The first time we came to one of
these, he dressed as Michael, and I was Laurie. Figured we'd switch it up
this year.” She shrugs. “Why he insisted on not wearing any damn
underwear under his hospital gown is beyond me.”
“Because it's funny.” Collin rolls his eyes at his wife.
She holds her fake knife up to him. “Keep it up, babysitter. I'll cut you.”
“And I'll escape. It's what I do.”
“I swear this is foreplay for them and we're all being forced to witness
it,” Rhodes grumbles from the other side of the counter.
I'm shocked to see him in costume, but when I notice who he and Ryan
are dressed up as, it makes total sense.
“Beauty and the Beast, huh?”
Ryan grins over the rim of her cup. “Fits us perfectly, doesn't it?”
“I love it,” I tell her, and I do. He's the big scarred grumpy man and
she's the beauty queen of YouTube who is currently in talks with a major
makeup company to launch her own line. It's totally fitting for them.
I check out the rest of the group's costumes. Smith and Emilia are
dressed as The Big Bad Wolf and Little Red Riding Hood, which seems
appropriate for them. Though I'm surprised to see them here with the new
baby at home, I love that Hollis and Lowell are dressed as two different
versions of Freddie Mercury, looking seconds away from bursting out into
“We Are the Champions.” The new guy, Ford, is dressed as Han Solo (I
guess a play on his name), and his girlfriend is Princess Leia. I don't know
either of them very well yet, but I'm excited to have new faces showing up
at the truck.
After seeing Stevie's costume, I'm not surprised to find Scout dressed
up as Anna, nor am I shocked to find Miller as Kristoff. But the one that
really gets me is the nose that's on a very, very grumpy-looking Greer.
“What?” he growls at me.
I tuck my lips together, refusing to laugh, mostly because I'm a little
scared of him.
“Nothing. I like your cos—” The word ends with a laugh because I
cannot hold it in any longer. “Really? That's the best you could muster up?”
He glowers at me. “Shut up. I make a damn fine Olaf, thank you very
much.”
He's wearing a full-on snowman costume complete with a fucking
carrot for a nose. He looks ridiculous, and I love it.
“You look great,” I tell him, speaking honestly. I really love seeing the
big grump be miserable.
“Doesn't he? We're playing find the carrot later.”
“Jesus,” Greer mutters, pinching the bridge of his nose, then setting
down his drink. He wraps his arms around Stevie's waist. “That's it—
you're cut off.”
“Oooh, are we starting now?” She grabs him through his jeans. “I found
something long and hard!”
Everybody laughs as he carries her from the kitchen.
“Please nobody hold this against her. She doesn't drink often,” Scout
says in defense of her sister.
I hold my hand up. “No judgment from me. I don't hold my liquor very
well either.”
This is exactly why I stopped at three shots before I left, and I'm
refusing to let another drop of alcohol touch my lips tonight. I'd rather not
be completely obliterated just in case I do happen to run into Fitz.
“So, what's your costume?” Scout asks.
“Oh.” I glance down at my outfit. It's not far off from what I'd wear for
my live streams. I paired my usual lingerie with a long, silky black skirt
with a slit that sits dangerously high on my thigh. “I'm not sure. I just threw
something together.”
“It looks familiar,” says Hayes, who is just wearing his jersey, eyes
narrowed as he takes me in.
I shrug, hoping he doesn't know what I spend my evenings doing.
“Well, it's cute. I love the top. I wish I were brave enough to wear
something like that.”
“Um, you do all the time for me, babe.” Miller presses a kiss to her
head. “Not that it's on long before it's on my bedroom floor.”
“Miller!” she hisses.
He doesn't look the least bit sorry.
I slide my eyes around the room, hoping maybe he abandoned his spot
on the couch and decided to join us, but with everyone wearing costumes,
it's hard to figure out who he is. I glance through the dining room and into
the second living room, and I stumble back when I find someone standing
in a corner, staring at me intently.
He's not dressed as anything I recognize, wearing a simple black suit
and a mask that's similar to mine, just inverse in coloring. His eyes are
burning a hole right through me, like he couldn't look away if he tried, and
frankly, I don't want him to.
Something about him seems familiar…like I should know him…
Someone passes by, and by the time they clear the area, the stranger is
gone.
Huh. Weird.
“Hey, I think I just saw Fitz head into that room,” Collin says, pointing
in the direction I was just looking. “Someone go get his antisocial ass and
bring him in here.”
“I'll do it,” I find myself saying before I realize what I'm doing.
Oh my god, can I be any more obvious?
If anyone is shocked by my volunteering, they don't show it.
I weave my way through the crowd, trying to avoid the drunken bodies
that are moving all over the room. When I finally make my way to where
Collin pointed, I know Fitz the second I spot him.
He's leaning one arm against a floor-to-ceiling window, looking out
over the dark yard. One hand is in his pocket, and even from here, I can tell
he's lost in thought. I don't expect him to spot me when I move closer, but
the shift in his posture is clear—he knows I'm here.
He turns toward me, a grin spreading across his face, showing off that
toothless smile that makes my stomach do all kinds of flips. The gold and
black mask he's wearing shifts with the movement, and he takes a step
closer. The scent I love so much, fresh linen with a hint of lavender, hits me
all at once, making me feel safe and comfortable.
He takes another step. Then another.
And suddenly, he's only inches away. So damn close that if I moved just
a little, we'd be touching, and I really want to be touched.
He leans toward me, his breath tickling my ear. “Evening, Ro.”
Two words…that's all he says. It's all he has to say.
And I know without a doubt there is no way I'm leaving this party
without making him mine.

FITZ
RoPlaying: You're a good friend.
I've read her message no less than fifty times since she sent it earlier.
I'm not a good friend. In fact, I'm the worst fucking friend ever. I'm
lying to her. Hell, I've been lying to her for months, in more ways than one.
A good friend wouldn't do that. A good friend would be honest. They
would walk up to her and say, Hey, I like watching your streams. I'm proud
of you. A good friend would definitely not reach for his cock in the shower,
thinking about the lacy top his friend was wearing during her last stream.
But that's exactly what I fucking did not even an hour ago as I was
getting ready for this stupid party. I felt awful afterward and promised
myself I'd never do it again, but seeing Rosie stand just a hundred feet
away from me completely decked out in her RoPlaying ensemble, I know
that's a promise I'm not going to be able to keep.
She looks incredible. Her tits are pushed up high, threatening to spill
over the top of her lacy bustier with every move she makes. And that
fucking slit in her skirt? The one practically painted onto her body? I want
to rip it off and do very, very naughty things to her.
It's taking everything I have not to cross the room, grab her hand, and
haul her away.
She's laughing at something Greer says, then I watch as he grabs his
girlfriend by the waist and pulls her away from the rest of the group.
“Fitz!” she calls out to me. “Rosie's here. She wants to bang you.”
“Holy fucking shit. Shut up, Stevie.”
“What?” She shrugs. “He totally wants to bang her too. They just need
to do it already.”
“Fucking Christ,” Greer mutters. He looks over at me and shakes his
head. “Ignore her. She's—”
“Plastered? I can tell.”
He grins, then drops his head closer. “But really, she isn't lying. Rosie is
totally into you, and I don't think it would be such a bad thing to see where
that goes.”
I pull back, surprised this is coming from a guy who just earlier this
year swore up and down he'd never, ever fall in love.
He shrugs. “I'm a changed man,” he says like he can read my mind.
“Besides, being in love is fun.”
“Your girlfriend is drunk off her ass, and it's barely nine.”
“Yeah, but she's cute when she's like this. Besides, between you and
me, you could really loosen up out there on the ice. You're tight.”
“I already have five goals this season.”
“Right, but you could have ten.”
I shake my head. “I'm not doing that. I'm not going to try to get into
Rosie's pants because I think it will help me play better hockey.”
“Then don't, but at least try to get into her pants because you really
fucking want to and this damn dance you two idiots have been doing is
getting tiresome to watch. She's clearly into you.”
I peek over at where she's still standing, talking to everyone else. She's
wearing her pink wig and mask, and I want to march over and pull them
both off so I can see the real her.
I like Rosie. I've liked her for a while now, long before I even knew
about her streaming. Never thought I had a chance in hell, but now…
“You think?”
“Dude, I know. Just trust me on this.”
Stevie drops her head to Greer's shoulder. “Jacob…” She moans his
name, and I have a feeling the rest of Greer's night is going to be spent
sitting up with her in the bathroom.
He sighs, but it's one of those sighs that comes out sounding sweet.
“I need to get her upstairs. Just…” He looks over his shoulder at the
baker, then back at me. “Don't fuck it up, man. I really fucking love those
donuts.”
“Hey! I'll make your donuts. You don't have to pimp Fitz out for
donuts. I can make them just as good as—oh, who am I kidding? I hate
making donuts. I'm awful at my job.”
I chuckle at Stevie's drunken rambling. “Go take care of her.”
Greer hauls his girlfriend into his arms, then carries her up the stairs.
I'm about to move from my spot when something catches my eye.
Rosie.
She's looking over. No—scratch that. She's looking at me.
Her green gaze is locked on to me, and I couldn't walk away if I tried,
not when she's practically staring into my soul like she's searching for all of
my deepest, darkest secrets.
Does she know what I did an hour ago? Does she know I had my hand
wrapped around my cock as I thought of her? Does she know at all what she
does to me? The power she holds? The power I want her to hold?
I don't think she does because if she did, we wouldn't be having this
staring contest we're participating in. We'd be upstairs in one of the
unoccupied rooms, and I'd be showing her the effect she has on me,
showing her how badly my cock is aching inside these tight slacks.
I need to move before I do something crazy like march over and pull her
into my arms. When someone passes by, I use it as my opportunity to slip
into the party, then I make my way to the great room.
In an effort to cool down, I lean my forehead against the glass of the
giant window that overlooks the sprawling backyard. I have no clue how
Lowell finds these places, but it's the perfect mixture of seclusion so we can
all have fun while still being elegant.
I take a few deep breaths, trying to talk my dick back down and regain a
sense of control. It's a futile attempt, especially when I feel the moment she
walks into the room.
I focus my eyes on the reflection in the window and watch—always
fucking watching—as she scans the crowded space. I already know it's me
she's looking for, so when her eyes land on me, I'm not surprised by the
small smile that plays at the corners of her lips.
She saunters into the room. That slit that's already too fucking high
moves with her, inching up and up until it's touching dangerous territory…
territory I don't want anyone else to see.
I spin around and stuff both hands into my pockets, telling myself it's
for her own good, and let a slow smile spread across my face. Unable to
stop myself, I take a step toward her, and my favorite scent in the entire
world hits my senses.
Strawberries.
Another step.
She doesn't move. Doesn't try to stop me. It's like we're the only two in
the room, and fuck how I wish that were true.
When there's barely any space left between us, just enough so we're not
touching because I know I'm a fucking goner if I touch her, I lean down so
she can hear me and say, “Evening, Ro.”
The hitch in her breath is clear, and I love how it sounds.
“Fitz,” she whispers.
I step back, letting my eyes roam as if I haven't already memorized
every single thing about her. “You look incredible.”
Color creeps into her cheeks, her jade eyes sparking with delight at my
words. “Thank you. You don't look too bad yourself. Who are you supposed
to be?”
“A guy who put his costume together at the last minute.”
She laughs. “I like your mask.”
Thanks. I picked it because it reminded me of yours. But I don't say that.
“It's Venetian.”
No shit, you idiot.
She smirks. “You don't say.”
Feeling the heat spreading across my cheeks, I blurt out the first thing
that comes to mind: “Did you see Wright's ass?”
She blinks twice, then a loud laugh tumbles out of her. “Unfortunately, I
did. Actually, who am I kidding? It's a great ass. Nothing unfortunate about
it.”
The overwhelming urge to find Wright and tell him to cover his shit up
hits me, and I have to physically pinch myself to keep from doing just that.
“I think Greer as Olaf might be a favorite, though,” she says with a
smirk.
“I offered to give him a warm hug and he punched me.”
“That sounds exactly like Greer. Between everyone teasing him about it
and Stevie being hammered, he's in for a long, long night.”
“Good. Serves the asshole right.”
“Poor Stevie.”
“Brave Stevie.”
Rosie laughs. “You got that right. I'm not sure how she puts up with his
gruffness, but she's totally into it. In fact, she told me they're off to play a
game of find the carrot.”
I shake my head. “She's had a bit too much to drink. Speaking of…can I
get you something? A vodka soda?”
“You know, I said I was done drinking, but I think I could use one right
about now.”
You're telling me.
I place my hand on the small of her back, steering her toward the
bartender in the corner. Lowell always goes all out with these things, and
there are about six different bars set up around the house.
I order myself a beer and a vodka soda for Rosie.
“You remembered,” she remarks.
Of course I did. I remember everything about you.
The bartender slides our drinks over to us, and we step to the side.
“So, how's Carl doing?” she asks before I can say anything stupid like
what I just thought. “Has she trapped herself in the pantry lately?”
“Worse—she snuck out again when I was bringing in the groceries,
darted right down the hall to my neighbor, Miss Drake's, apartment.”
“Aw. Does your neighbor not like Carl?”
“Oh, she loves Carl. The problem is my neighbor also loves walking
around her apartment in the nude. So, when I went to retrieve my shithead
cat…”
“You got to see granny in the buff?” She winces.
“Unfortunately. And unlike with Wright, I very much mean
unfortunately.”
Rosie laughs, then taps my cheek a few times with her palm. “You poor
thing, you. Are you traumatized? Do I need to kiss you to make you forget
all about Miss Drake and her hot bod?” Her eyes widen when she realizes
what she's just said, and she slaps her hand over her mouth. “Oh my god.
Pretend I didn't just say that,” she mutters through her fingers.
I don't want to pretend she didn't say that, and I really don't want to
pretend I don't want her to follow through. Before I think too much about it,
I step into her, not missing when she swallows roughly.
“And what if I want you to kiss me?”
Several seconds pass. Too fucking many seconds, in fact.
We stand there so damn long just staring at one another that I'm pretty
sure I just completely overstepped and messed everything up.
But then, Rosie runs her tongue over her lips and says, “Hey, Fitz?”
I swallow the lump that's stuck in my throat. “Yeah?”
“Do you want to get out of here?”
I don't think. I act.
I grab her by the waist and pull her to my side, marching us both
through the party and up the stairs. I open the first door I find.
A bathroom. It will have to do, because there is no way I can wait
another second to feel her mouth on mine. I tug her inside, then close the
door behind her, pressing her back against the wood.
She gasps when I press myself flush with her body, and I have no doubt
it's because she can feel how fucking hard I am. I want this. I want her. In
fact, I can't remember a time when I wanted anything more, when I've
craved something so damn badly. Maybe when I was in a Game Seven
final? I don't know, but it felt different than this. This feels…like more.
I peer into her eyes, the beautiful green ones that are wide and full of so
many questions, yet also so much lust. I run my thumb over her cheek,
savoring this moment…this heated look in her eyes. She's gorgeous, her
cheeks tinged with a bit of pink, lips parted as her chest heaves heavily
against me.
She wants this as much as I do.
I have no clue who moves toward who first. All I know is the moment
her lips touch mine, I'm absolutely fucking done for. Her mouth is soft and
sweet like she might have snuck a piece of candy or two before coming to
find me.
She moans when I brush my tongue along the seam of her lips, and they
open effortlessly. Her hands twist into my hair, finding the tie on my mask
and tugging it free. We break just long enough for me to take it off and set it
aside.
“God, I've been dying to touch you,” I whisper against her lips, running
my palms over her hips, feeling every fucking delicious inch of her. It's
heaven and sin all at once, and at this moment, I'm totally okay with going
to hell for this.
“I've been dying for you to touch me,” she says back as her lips ghost
over my chin. She nips along my jawline until she hits my ear, then she
sucks the lobe between her teeth and bites me just hard enough for it to
sting, and I fucking welcome it.
My grasp on her tightens, tugging her close, begging her to keep going,
and she does. She bites at me gently, then runs her tongue over each and
every place she's just sunk her teeth into. I groan when she hits that spot
just below my ear, and she doesn't miss it.
“Ro…you smell like strawberries.” I nuzzle my nose against her neck.
“I fucking love strawberries.”
“I know.” She kisses me again. “They're your favorite.”
“You're my favorite.”
She grins against me as I capture her mouth in another kiss, plunging
my tongue inside. She kisses me back with fervor, pulling on my suit jacket
and yanking me closer. I reach down and bunch her skirt in my fists, lifting
it high enough for me to press a knee between her legs, thankful as hell for
the high slit that gives me more room to work with.
She groans the second she makes contact with my thigh and begins
rocking against me, trying to find the angle that works best for her. I drag
my hands back up her body, loving how soft she is beneath my palms, and I
don't stop until my fingers are at the top of the lacy dark purple bustier
she's wearing. Only then do I break the kiss.
I search her eyes in a silent question. Can I?
She nods, then watches as my fingers work to unhook the lacy material.
My mouth fucking waters like a teen seeing boobs for the first time the
minute she spills out of her top. Her tits are big, definitely more than a
handful, and her nipples are the exact shade of her rosy lips. I want to kiss
them just as badly as I want to kiss her.
“Fitz…” she pleads, likely tired of me just standing here looking at her
like the angel she is and wanting me to touch her. “Please.”
I can't deny her what she wants, not when her voice comes out as
nothing but a strain.
I capture a nipple between my lips, sucking the sweet bud into my
mouth. She groans and shifts her hips against me harder…faster. I take my
time tasting her, learning what she likes and what she doesn't. Based on the
way she slips her hands into my hair and holds me to her when I use my
teeth to tease her, she really likes that.
“I need…” I hear her say, and I pull away, understanding exactly what it
is she needs.
I drag her by the waist, setting her in front of the mirror as I take my
place behind her.
“I want to watch you finger your cunt, Rosie,” I say against her ear.
“Can you do that for me?”
She gulps loudly and nods. “Yes.”
“Good. Very good. Take your panties off and put them in my pocket.”
She bends, making sure to press her ass against me, and grabs them.
When she straightens, she slides them into the pocket of my pants, knowing
exactly what she's doing when she brushes her knuckles against my cock,
which is rock hard inside my slacks. I hiss at the contact, and she smirks.
“Evil,” I mutter, and she laughs.
She rests her back against me and spreads her legs as I bunch her long
skirt up in my hands, pulling it up until her pussy is exposed. Her thighs are
thick just like the rest of her and rub together.
I bet they'd feel incredible wrapped around my head.
I intend to find out, but not tonight. Tonight, I want to watch.
I hold the material and watch as she slides her hands down her body,
something I've seen her do countless times on her streams. She's taunting
me, and I love every single minute of it. My mouth is literally watering with
anticipation as she takes her time getting to where I want her. It's like she
knows I need this buildup.
She runs her fingertips over every curve and dip until she gets to her
mound, which is neatly trimmed. Only then does she slip two fingers
between her legs, parting her pussy and giving me my first glimpse of her.
Fucking shit.
She's wet and pink and absolutely fucking everything I thought she
should be.
“You're beautiful,” I tell her, not caring when my voice comes out all
scratchy. “Fucking perfect.”
A sickly-sweet grin curves her lips, then she slides her fingers over her
clit, not taking her eyes off me as she plunges two fingers inside.
“Oh god,” she mutters as she begins to fuck herself, grinding down on
her hand and using her palm to stimulate her clit.
It's perfect. She's perfect.
I tell her just that, and she sighs at my words.
I lift my eyes from what she's doing between her legs to look at her
face, and I'm surprised when I find her staring right at me in the mirror.
She's not watching herself. She's watching me watch her, and I swear it
spurs her on even more.
My knuckles are pure white at this point and there's no way it won't be
obvious her skirt was in my hands with how wrinkly it will be, but I don't
care. Not when I have this fucking goddess in front of me. Not when her
panting picks up and her chest begins to move rapidly. She's close, and I
want nothing more than to watch her fall apart.
“Get yourself there, Ro. I want to see what it looks like when your cunt
is squeezing your fingers.”
My words motivate her, and with just a few strokes, she's detonating
before my eyes, her body going rigid, her lips parting, but that's not what
gets me. That's not what sends me completely over the edge.
No.
It's my name tumbling from her lips as she rides out her orgasm.
“Ivan.”
I'm ashamed of what happens next. It's something I can't control,
something that's never happened before.
I come in my fucking pants.
Like some teen who can't control themselves, I fall apart right along
with her, pressing myself against her as waves of pleasure crash over me.
The second I've regained my breath, I spin her in my arms and crash my
mouth to hers, desperate to taste her again. She groans against me, tugging
me closer until I'm not sure where I end and she begins. I kiss her lips, up
her jaw to her ear, going as far as I can until her mask gets in the way. I slip
my hands into her hair, searching for the tie, never taking my lips from her
body.
“I always wondered what it would feel like to peel this off you,” I
mutter against her when my fingers finally find the end of the string.
She goes limp in my arms, and I feel it instantly. I pull back to search
her eyes, worried I've done something to hurt her.
“Is every—”
“What did you just say?” she asks sharply, those green eyes I love so
much darting back and forth between my own hazel ones.
“I said, I always…”
The rest of the words die on my lips because I know. I fucking know.
I messed up. No, I more than messed up. I wrecked this. Completely
fucking ruined it. Obliterated any chance we had.
She shoves at me, and I stumble backward, letting her push me out of
the way; I deserve it. She crashes her hands through her hair, ripping her
mask off, letting me see all of her for the first time tonight.
“Do you…” She sucks in a deep breath. “Fitz, do you watch me?”
I could lie. I could make something up, could find a way out of this.
But I have no fight in me. So, I tell her the truth.
“Yes.”
Her jaw drops, but no words come out of her mouth. She shakes her
head a few times. She appears disgusted with me, like she can't believe the
person she's looking at.
I take a step toward her. “Listen, I—”
“How long?” she interrupts, holding her hands up to stop me.
“Excuse me?”
“How long? How long have you been watching me?” I hate the
emphasis she puts on the word, like she's completely revolted by the idea
even though she's the one who gets paid to be watched. “How long have
you known?”
I gulp. “A few months.”
“Months? Months, Fitz?!” I hate the way my last name drops off her
tongue, especially now that I know what it's like to hear her speak my first
name.
She gasps, her hand going to her chest, and I know what she's going to
say next.
“You're ShootsAndScores.”
I say nothing. I don't confirm it, but I don't deny it either, and that's
enough for her.
She scoffs, shoving her skirt back down into place and pulling her top
back up, covering those very tits I just had in my mouth, the ones I know
taste so damn sweet.
She grabs the door handle, shooting me a glare. “You're nothing like I
thought you were, Fitz.”
Then she's gone, disappearing right out the door before I can stop her.
Everything I ever wanted flashes before my eyes, then shatters like
someone just shot a hundred-mile-per-hour puck right at it, everything
inside me breaking right along with it.
I need to fix this. I have to fix this. She can't leave.
I yank the door open, praying and hoping she's not gone. I spot her at
the end of the hallway, one foot already on the top stair, ready to flee.
“Ro!”
She pauses, then looks back at me. “Don't ever call me that again.” She
spins on her heel and leaves…taking every bit of my heart along with her.
I am so completely fucked.

ROSIE
Fitz watches me.
Fitz subscribes to my channel.
Fitz is ShootsAndScores.
Fitz pays me.
That's all that's been playing in my mind for the last three days as I've
lain in bed. I've skipped work, leaving Stevie to pick up my slack. I've even
skipped classes. I sure as hell haven't done any streaming, leaving my
subscribers to resort to DMing me trying to figure out where I've gone to. I
have no doubt I've lost a few of them by now, but I can't be bothered to
worry about losing that income. I'll figure something else out, possibly
something that has nothing to do with being on camera because right now,
just looking at my computer has my stomach rolling.
Fitz watches me.
I can't believe it. I can't believe the sweet guy behind the keyboard, the
guy I thought was just being friendly…it was the guy I've been crushing on
the entire time. Every conversation, every gentle push to give Fitz another
chance…it was all him.
I'm hurt.
I'm mad.
I'm…still craving his touch.
God, how messed up does that make me? Probably pretty damn fucked
in the head, but I can't help it. Having his hands on me…his lips…having
him watch me as I fingered myself to release…it was everything I didn't
know I needed. I loved every minute we shared in that bathroom—until he
uttered words that changed everything.
I steer my car into the gravel lot and pull into my familiar parking spot.
I shift into park and finally drag my eyes to the place I've been avoiding for
days now. It still looks the same, the bright baby blue truck with the cute
little awning and the books stacked on a shelf that sits off to one side. The
picnic tables each have a basket of napkins and a small vase filled with
fresh flowers from the market down the street. Everything looks the same,
but it all feels so different. This is the place I first met Fitz, and now it feels
tainted too.
Stevie is moving around inside the truck, bustling from one side to the
other as she preps the donuts for the day.
I owe her so much for covering for me. I know there's no way she
wasn't completely hungover after the party, and I know Sunday must have
been nuts because it's always packed. Monday tends to bring a crowd too.
I'm awful for letting her manage this all on her own, but I couldn't bring
myself to show back up here. Not after everything.
I check the clock on the dash of my Toyota: we're set to open in half an
hour. I should really get in there and help her.
“You can do this, Rosie,” I mutter. “You're a badass who has handled
heartbreak before. You got this too.”
I let out a heavy sigh, shut my car off, and push my door open. I grab
my purse from the passenger seat, then step out. Slowly, I make my way
toward the truck I'm dreading walking into.
When I'm halfway there, Stevie spots me, and the smile that fills her
face makes the guilt that's sitting in my chest feel ten pounds heavier.
“You're here!” She claps her hands together, looking like her usual
sunshiny self as she bounces on the balls of her feet. “I missed you!”
I smile for the first time in days. “I missed you too.”
And it's true. I did miss her. It was never her I was upset with or
avoiding.
It's him.
I cross the rest of the way to the truck, and the minute I'm inside,
Stevie's throwing her arms around me, pulling me into a hug.
“Oh my gosh,” she practically squeals, hugging me tightly. “I was
starting to worry I'd never see you again.” She pulls back, her eyes
scanning over me in that typical mom look they all give a child they're
worried about. “How are you feeling?”
There's so much sincerity in her words and in the stare she's giving me,
and before I know it, my chin is wobbling and I can feel the stupid tears
forming in my eyes.
Stevie's face falls. “Oh no, what's wrong? What happened?”
And then the tears fall free.
She steers me over to the chair we have in the back, the one that hardly
ever gets used inside the truck, everyone always opting to take it out back
and into the sunshine. She pushes me into it gently, then kneels on the floor
in front of me. She sits there for several minutes, not once rushing me or
asking me to talk to her. She just rubs my arm, letting me work through
whatever this is.
I can't remember the last time I cried like this. Maybe when Levi told
me he was leaving? But this…this feels different.
When I've finally calmed down enough, I wipe my tears from my face
and blow out a breath.
“I'm sorry,” I say to her.
She shakes her head. “Don't you dare apologize to me. I'm just… Are
you all right?”
Now it's my turn to shake my head. “No.”
“Do you want to talk about it?”
“Not really, but I probably should.”
She smiles sadly. “I know how that is.”
I sigh shakily, then roll my tongue over my lips, tasting the salt from my
tears. “It's…” The words get stuck in my throat.
It's hard because it hurts but also because it's so damn embarrassing.
How stupid am I? How could I not have known something like this would
happen?
“Is it Fitz?”
My eyes snap to Stevie's. “How…”
She shrugs. “He's been coming by every day since the party asking for
you, and every day, he looks worse and worse. You weren't coming in and
he looked like crap and I might have heard from my sister and Miller that
they saw you run away from the party, so I just kind of assumed…”
“Oh.” I nod, squeezing my eyes shut, holding back the tears that
threaten again. “It's Fitz.”
“What happened? I thought maybe the party was finally your chance. I
mean, I was pretty drunk”—she grins sheepishly—“but I saw how he was
looking at you. He was totally into you, and I know you're into him.
What'd I miss?”
“It's kind of a long story, and we don't have long before we open…”
“If you think opening this truck is more important than whatever's
going on, you're wrong.” She squeezes my arm. “Talk to me.”
I sigh, then launch into the long story of everything that's happened
with Fitz over the last few weeks, including what happened at the
Halloween party over the weekend. She listens to every word, not
interrupting, letting me get it all out.
When I'm finally done, she gives me a soft smile. “He's a fucking
moron.”
A laugh bubbles out of me, and it feels so damn good. I needed it more
than I realized.
“He really is,” I agree, and I mean it.
“But…” Stevie sighs. “Please don't get mad at me for saying this, but I
don't think he meant any harm.”
I nibble on my bottom lip, because as much as I hate to admit it,
Stevie's right. That's just not who Fitz is.
“He's too nice for his intentions to be malicious. I mean, hell, you've
seen the guy—he's always blushing, almost never talks, and he's just…
Well, he's Fitz. He's quiet and polite and just so…nice.”
“I know,” I say, nodding a few times. “He is all those things. But he also
lied to me.”
“He did, and that was wrong, and you have every right to be mad at
him, but…”
“But I don't think he did it on purpose,” I finish for her. “I don't think
he set out to be deceitful.”
“Yeah, me either.”
That's the hardest part of this. I know Fitz. Doing this…it's not him. A
part of me wishes I could say it is, could say he's nothing but a jerk and
doesn't deserve my time…but I can't say any of that because I don't feel
like it's true.
“He's been here every day,” she says. “Like every day. He comes in the
mornings before practice. He just sits on one of the benches out there and
waits for you. I tell him you're not coming, but he doesn't believe me. He
just…waits. Then he comes back after practice and does the same thing. It's
been like that every day, and I'm sure the only reason he's not here now is
because they play in New York tonight, but tomorrow, he'll be back. I
guarantee it.”
I hate that my heart skips a beat with every word she utters. I hate that I
love it that he's shown up here, but I do. I do love it—so damn much.
“I should talk to him.”
“You should,” Stevie agrees. “Because I think if you two work this out,
you could be something great together. I mean, you like being watched and
he likes watching, so it works.” She waggles her brows and grins.
I smile back, but it's gone as quickly as it came, unease settling into my
belly.
“What's wrong?”
I bite my bottom lip. “Am I… Is it weird that I like it? Being watched?
That I liked it when he…when he just watched and got off on it?”
She's shaking her head before I even get the entire question out. “No,
not at all, but I understand how you feel, why you'd feel that way. I thought
something was wrong with me and my…tastes too.”
My brows crush together. “Do you like being watched too?”
“No. I mean, I don't hate it if it's Greer, but it's…other stuff. Greer is…
He's rough, you know? He's commanding and he likes it that way. And I
like it that way. I didn't think I would after…” She trails off, her eyes
dropping to the floor of the truck, but I know what—and who—she's
referring to. It's her ex. “I didn't think after the abuse I went through that it
would be something I'd like, didn't think I'd crave the roughness and him
bossing me around, but I like it. I want to please him. I want him to tell me
when I'm doing good for him, you know? It makes me feel good, powerful,
like I'm taking back everything that was taken from me. I think it's because
even though I know Greer's the one doing the bossing, I'm really the one in
charge, and if I ever want it to stop, I only need to utter a single word and
he'll back off. I feel safe with him, comfortable.” She finally looks up at
me. “Is that how Fitz makes you feel?”
Yes.
Not once during our time in the bathroom did I feel unsafe. It's not that
I ever feel unsafe on my streams or anything, but with Fitz it just felt…
different. It felt right, like that's how it's supposed to be. Never mind that
orgasm I had. It was easily the most intense of my life. I can't remember
ever getting so damn aroused by fingering myself, and I masturbate
regularly.
“It is,” I tell her.
“Then don't let it pass you by. Give him a chance to explain.”
I nod. “I will.”
“And if it makes you feel any better, my first sexual experience with
Greer sucked too. Well, I mean technically I sucked, but still.”
“Stevie!” I admonish, and she laughs. “But seriously…what happened?”
She tells me about going down on him the first time and then him
leaving immediately afterward.
“Wow. These hockey boys are idiots, huh?”
She nods. “You have no idea. But after he explained things, I
understood. I mean, he'd never been with someone he actually cared about
before. He had no clue how to act. And plus, he was worried about how I'd
react to his roughness. He didn't realize I was totally into it and would have
been more than fine with the night continuing.”
“And now you two horndogs can't keep your hands off each other, Miss
Plays Find the Carrot in Front of the Entire Halloween Party.”
She buries her face in her hands. “Oh my god. I still can't believe I did
that. Drunk Stevie is a whole other version of me.”
I laugh because she's not wrong. “It was fun. I'm sure everyone's
forgotten by now.”
She gives me a look that says I'm full of shit, and I don't blame her.
There is no way anybody is letting her live that down.
“All right,” she says, shoving up from the floor, then holding her hands
out to me. “Come on. Up.” I let her tug me out of the chair. “Today, let's
focus on donuts. Tomorrow, we'll fix your broken heart, deal?”
I nod. “Deal.”
So that's what I do. I throw myself into work. I knead dough, I shape
donuts and ice them, and I refill coffee, rinse and repeat for hours and
hours.
And the entire time, I think about one thing: Fitz.
11
FITZ
“Yo, Fitzy Baby! Come here!”
I suppress the groan crawling its way from my throat. The last thing I
want to do is go talk to Greer. In fact, I don't want to talk to fucking
anybody. It's been days since I've seen Rosie, and all I want to do is get out
on the ice and beat New York so I can get back on the plane and home to
her because I need to fix things.
I've gone to the donut truck every day since the party. I've been
attached to my phone and computer, waiting for her to get on her stream.
I've even tried messaging her on MyFans, but nothing. Not a damn thing
from her. It's killing me, tearing me completely apart. I haven't even had a
strawberry since Saturday morning because I can't stand the fucking sight
or smell of them. All it does is remind me of Rosie.
I shove my phone into my pocket and spin on my heel, backtracking
across the parking garage toward Greer, who is standing beside the bus we
just got off.
“What's up?” I ask him.
“Over here. Got something I want to show you,” he says, motioning for
me to follow him around the other side of the bus.
I have no clue what's going on and don't really have the patience for
this, but I follow him anyway. I regret it the second I round the vehicle
because all of a sudden I'm being slammed against the big rig and there's a
forearm pressed heavily against my throat.
“W-What the…” I manage to sputter out. “Get the fuck off me.”
“Not a damn chance.” He shoves me harder, sneering. “What the fuck,
man? What'd I tell you?”
“What?” I cough, slowly losing my ability to breathe. “What are you
talking about?”
“Rosie, you fucking asshole. That's what I'm talking about. I just got
off the phone with Stevie, and I swear to god, if you don't tell me what the
hell crawled up your ass, you'll be walking back out there with a black eye,
which I'm sure you'll have great fun explaining to the press and Coach.”
“Fuck,” I mutter, dropping my head back against the bus. It hurts, but I
welcome the sting.
“Yeah, fuck is right. What the hell, man? What'd you do?”
“Can you let me go?”
He laughs, and it's downright fucking scary. “Not a chance.”
I sigh. Since he's not going to let me go until I explain things, I tell him.
Everything.
Only when I'm finished does he finally let me go, and I drop back to the
flats of my feet and reach for my throat, massaging it. It's aching and I'm
definitely going to be hoarse, but honestly, I deserve it. Hell, I deserve
worse.
“What the hell, man?” he asks again. “Why?”
I shrug. “I don't know.” But that's not true. I do know. “I just…couldn't
stop myself. I couldn't help it. I wanted to be close to her. No…I needed to
be close to her, and this felt like the only way.”
“You couldn't have, I don't fucking know, just asked her out?”
“I…” I drag a hand through my hair. “I didn't think she'd be into me,
you know? I'm not exactly smooth with the ladies.” I show off my missing
tooth. “And then there's this ugly fucking thing.”
“Your missing tooth?” He rolls his eyes. “You're kidding, right? That's
basically real-life porn to women, especially the ones who love hockey.
Rosie loves your damn missing tooth. Hell, I've seen her swoon over it
before. I don't know how your stupid ass has missed it, but she's totally into
you.”
“Well, I know that now.”
He laughs, but there's no humor in it. “You're an idiot.”
“I know.”
“Like Miller-level idiot.”
I half expect the man in question to come out of nowhere and yell at us
in protest, but he doesn't.
“Yeah, I know,” I tell Greer. “But I'm going to fix it.”
“Good. You fucking better.”
I glare at him. “I will.”
He eyes me hard, possibly harder than he ever has before. “You really
like her, huh?”
I nod. “So much. I have for a while, before I even found her stream, but
I've been so focused on hockey I didn't let myself really think much of it,
you know? I know this season means a lot to Coach, and I want to focus on
it for him and for the team. Then I found her stream and I thought, this is it.
It was my way to be close to her without worrying about screwing with my
game. It felt like it was meant to be…but I couldn't stay away.”
With how things played out, a huge part of me wishes I could have kept
my distance, but now that I know how good she tastes, how good she
feels…I was doomed from the start.
And dammit if I'm not okay with being doomed.
“I get it, man. I do. I didn't want to get involved with Stevie, but…” He
shrugs. “Here I am, completely fucked for that woman.”
I grin, because it's still so weird to hear him say that. “You're totally
whipped, man.”
He lifts a brow. “Like you're not screwed when it comes to Rosie?”
I wince, because I am. I'm completely screwed, and now I have to fix it
before she realizes how much better than me she can do.
“That's what I thought.” He shakes his head. “Damn, man. We have
some dumb people on this team who have done some really dumb things,
but this…” He whistles. “You've been lying to her for months, pretending
to be someone else.”
“I know,” I say, shoving off the bus. “I fucking know. I'm going to fix
it.”
He gives me another hard stare, then nods once. “All right. I'm giving
you a chance, but if you don't—”
“You'll beat me to a pulp—yeah, I got it.”
What he doesn't know is I'd let him. I'd certainly have it coming. I just
hope it doesn't come to that. I hope I can fix things with Rosie.
I have to.
“I'll fix it,” I promise, but I'm not sure if I'm talking to Greer or myself.
Either way, I hope it's a promise I can keep.
We beat New York, no fucking thanks to me and all the asinine penalties I
took. Stupid stuff, stuff I know I shouldn't be doing but did anyway. Too
many crosschecks right in front of the linesman. Straight-up tripping
someone and not even trying to hide it. Slashing.
And that was all in the first period.
I played so awful Coach benched me for the last ten minutes of the
game, and I don't blame him. He refused to talk to me afterward, so I'm
dreading going to practice this morning because I know I'm going to get my
ass reamed for my behavior. My list of people I need to fix things with just
keeps growing, and it's really starting to feel like a bad omen.
I lift my head, watching the robin's-egg blue truck get closer and closer
as my feet pound heavily against the pavement.
Please let her be here. Please let her be here. Please let her be here.
I repeat it with every step I take until I skid to a stop in the parking lot.
The closed sign is still up on the counter, but the window is open, and I hold
my breath, welcoming the ache in my lungs as I wait to get my first glimpse
of her in days.
I don't have to wait long because not even fifteen seconds later, she's
there. There's a giant box in her hands. I can't make out from here what's in
it, but it looks heavy, and I want so fucking badly to waltz into the truck and
take it from her like some knight in shining armor so I can prove to her I'm
more than just some asshole.
Even from here, she looks beautiful. Maybe a little tired, but still
gorgeous. Always fucking gorgeous. Her hair is tossed up in her usual bun
and her trusty apron is tied around her waist, covering all those curves I
know she has, those same curves I committed to memory the other night at
the party and really fucking want to touch again.
As if she can feel my eyes on her, she lifts her head and looks directly at
me.
And I…wave.
I lift my damn hand and wave.
God, what a moron.
Both of her brows rise and I swear I see her lips mutter idiot, but that's
all that happens. She doesn't run away. She doesn't try to hide from me.
No. She does something worse.
She pretends I'm not even here.
Rosie returns her attention to the task at hand, and it hurts more than if
she were to march out of the truck and tell me off. I press my palm to my
chest, an ache forming that I wish I could never feel again because I hate it
so much. Is this how Greer felt when he screwed everything up with Stevie?
This blows, and I need to make it go away. Now.
I pull my headphones from my ears and tuck them into my pockets, then
cross the lot to the truck. Rosie lifts her head when she hears the gravel
crunching beneath my feet, but she doesn't tell me to fuck off. I take that as
a good sign and keep moving forward.
In fact, I don't stop until I'm at the end of the truck. The doors are open
wide, and I peer inside. She's standing there, just staring at me. Watching.
Waiting.
I take a step in.
When she doesn't protest, I take another. Then another.
I reach over to grab the bar that's holding the window open and give it a
tug. It folds in on itself easily, trapping us inside under the low interior
lights. Rosie still doesn't say anything, and part of me wishes she would. I
wish she would yell or call me names or tell me to get lost. Something.
Anything. God knows I deserve it.
But she doesn't. She just stands there, her arms folded over her chest,
her brows lifted high as she takes me in, sweaty state and all.
I grab a plastic cup from the stack, retrieve the pitcher of water I know
they keep in the fridge, and I pour myself a glass. I chug it in five seconds
flat, then refill it just to do it all over again.
I drag my hand over my mouth and meet Rosie's hard stare. “I—”
“Oh, no. You don't get to talk first, Fitz.”
Fitz.
She's called me that before. Hell, except for the one time, it's all she's
ever called me. Nobody ever calls me by my first name; they haven't since
middle school. It's always been Fitz or Fitzgerald, never Ivan…until her.
I want to be Ivan again.
“You're a dick.”
I swallow the lump that seems to be superglued inside my throat. “I
know.”
“Like a major, massive dick that's covered in warts and moles and all
kinds of other awful things I can't think of right this moment because I'm
so damn mad at you.”
“I know.”
If it's even possible, her stare hardens further. “You hurt me.”
“I—”
“You led me on. You pretended to be someone else. You manipulated
me into letting you apologize for ditching me at Slapshots. You lied to me,
Fitz, and it fucking hurt.”
I just nod, not because I don't have things to say, but because I know
she doesn't want to hear them.
“I thought you were different. I thought you were better than that. I
thought…” She looks away a moment, then rolls her tongue over her lips. “I
thought I knew you.”
I take a step toward her, unable to help myself. To my surprise, she
doesn't move back.
“You do know me, Rosie. You do. I'm still the same guy. I just…” I
drag my hand through my hair. “I just fucked up. You're so…” I gesture
toward her. “Well, you. You're comfortable with who you are, in your body.
It's kind of intimidating sometimes. I didn't think… I never thought
someone like you could be into someone like me.”
“What's so wrong with you that you thought that?”
I shrug. “I don't know. I mean…” I flash her my smile. “This, for
starters.”
“That? Are you kidding? I wanted to throw my panties at you the first
time you smiled at me, and about ninety percent of that was because of your
missing tooth. It's cute, Fitz.”
“It bothers me.”
“So get it fixed.”
I give an Are you serious? look.
“Oh. Right. Hockey.”
I nod. “Hockey. Sure, I could do flippers or something, but why bother
while I'm still playing? At first, I was cool with it, you know? It felt like a
badge of honor or something. But then some comments…the stares I'd
get…I don't know. It just all added up to me feeling incredibly selfconscious about it.”
“I like it.”
“I know. I mean, now—I know that now. But still.”
She gives me a sad smile. “What else? Why do you think you're not
good enough to just ask me out?”
“Well, there's the watching thing. The…voyeurism.” It's the first time
I've said the word out loud. Sure, I've googled it countless times, but I've
never acknowledged that I might have a kink like that.
“What about it?”
“It doesn't…bother you?”
“Um, hello.” She waves both hands. “I'm basically a cam girl over here.
I think you know I like being watched.”
Images of what it was like the last time I watched her flash through my
mind. Heat creeps up my neck and into my cheeks just thinking about how
beautiful she looked as she fell apart in front of me.
“Did someone tell you it's not okay?”
That fucking lump returns, and I try to swallow around it.
“Please tell me you told them they're completely in the wrong.”
“She wasn't really wrong. It is weird, right? I get off on watching
someone have sex more than I like having sex. That's fucked up, no?”
“It's not fucked up, Fitz. It's just who you are, and that's okay. Would
you tell me I'm fucked up for liking being watched?”
“No! No. Never.”
“Okay.” She shrugs. “Then you're not fucked up either.”
When she says it all out loud like this, it sounds…reasonable. It sounds
okay. It sounds like something that could work…like we could work.
“Rosie, I…” I swipe my tongue over my lips, then take another step
toward her because I need to be close to her. “I'm sorry. I'm sorry I lied to
you. I'm sorry I tricked you. I'm sorry I didn't come clean from the
beginning. Hell, I'm sorry I kept watching your videos even when I knew it
was you. I just…I really like you. Like, a lot. And I'd really, really like it if
you gave me another chance. I'd like a chance to be real and honest with
you.”
Her green eyes bore into me, her teeth clamping tightly on her bottom
lip as she considers my words—my plea.
That's what this is. I'm a desperate man in a desperate moment. I need
her to believe me, to give me another chance. Because there is no chance in
hell I'm going to be able to stay away from her. Not now. Not after
everything.
“How?” she says softly.
“Sorry?”
“How did you know it was me?”
“Oh.” I take another step forward, lifting my hand. I pause just a
moment before I touch her, making sure it's okay. She doesn't move or tell
me no, so I reach out, cupping the side of her face and running my thumb
over her cheek. “Your eyes. I knew because of your eyes.”
Her brows pinch together. “Lots of people have green eyes. I—”
“No.” I shake my head, lifting my other hand to her face, using my
thumb to trace the freckle that sits just below her eye. “Not like yours. They
don't have green eyes like yours, Ro. I'd know them anywhere.”
She swallows harshly. “Oh.”
“Yeah. Oh.”
She's back to nibbling on her lips, and all I can do is watch as she works
through everything in her mind.
Please give me a chance. Please, please, please.
After what feels like hours of us standing here, of her just chewing on
her lip, she drags her eyes back to mine. Her jaw drops, and I worry for a
moment she can hear my heart beating in my chest because I swear it's
moving harder and faster than it ever has before.
“I—”
“What the hell?” A muffled voice breaks the moment, and I turn around
just in time to see the back door being ripped open.
“What in the actual fu—oh.”
Scout, the owner of the truck, is standing at the back door. She has one
foot inside, her eyes wide and her face full of shock.
“Scout, hi,” Rosie says, stepping out from behind me.
“Um, hi,” Scout says tentatively, her gaze flitting from me to Rosie and
back again. Her brows slide together. “Is everything okay?”
“Yeah, everything is—”
“I wasn't asking you,” Scout says tersely, cutting me off. She looks at
her head baker, checking in with her directly. I love it. I love how protective
she is. “Rosie, is everything okay?”
I peek back at Rosie, who sends Scout a soft smile.
“Yeah, everything is okay,” she tells her. “I'm sorry. We were talking
and I—”
Scout holds her hand up. “Is everything ready to go?”
“Yes. All the donuts are prepped, coffee is made, and the drawer's been
counted in. We're good.”
“All right. We open in ten minutes, so whatever this”—she waves her
hand between the two of us—“is, just wrap it up.”
Rosie nods. “We will. Thank you.”
“Of course.” Scout looks at me, her eyes still hard. “I have a feeling
you're being dumb, aren't you?”
I grimace and nod.
Scout rolls her eyes and mutters, “Fucking hockey players.” She walks
out of the truck, shaking her head and pulling the door shut behind her,
bathing us in the low light once more.
The moment she's gone, I turn back to Rosie.
“You know, I'm really starting to think that whole people believing
hockey players are stupid thing is true.”
Rosie arches one brow. “Sometimes it is.”
I nod. “I deserved that.”
“You did.”
Silence falls between us again, and I hold my breath once more, waiting
for her answer, hoping and praying she'll tell me what I want to hear.
“You're kind of killing me here, Ro,” I say after several minutes. “And
we are on a time crunch.”
She glowers, and I can't help the smirk that curls up one side of my
mouth. She's being sassy with me; I like it when she's sassy with me.
Then finally, after another minute of silence, she utters a single word.
“Okay.”
My heart stutters in my chest. Did she just say what I think she did?
“Okay?” I ask.
She nods. “I'll give you another chance. But, Fitz? I need you to be
honest with me. Completely.”
“It's not Carl who is afraid of the dark. It's me.”
“What?”
I lift a shoulder. “You said you wanted honesty. The reason I keep nightlights in every room is because I'm scared of the dark. I mean, Carl isn't the
biggest fan, but she's got that cool crazy cat vision. I don't and am totally
afraid a monster is going to reach out and grab my leg and drag me away to
hell. When I go on the road, I take a night-light with me and plug it in. I tell
everyone Miller does it to make myself feel better, but he doesn't. It's all
me.”
A laugh bubbles out of her, and not until this moment did I realize how
much I missed hearing that sound over the last few days. This is the longest
I've gone without seeing her for months, and I needed it more than I knew.
“That's a good start. I was thinking more like you could not pretend to
be someone else, but that works too.”
“That's a fair request.”
“Speaking of requests…” She clears her throat. “I'd like it if you… Will
you unsubscribe?”
A heaviness hits my gut. I hate the idea of not being able to see her.
But…I get it. It's probably weird. I mean, she's working; why would
she want me to watch her?
“It's just…I'd feel weird if we're dating and I'm accepting money from
you like that.”
Oh. Well, that makes sense too.
“Okay,” I tell her. “I'll unsubscribe as soon as I get home.”
Then her words hit me.
“Wait… Are we?”
“Are we what?” she asks.
“Dating. Are we dating?”
“Yes.”
My chest fills with something I haven't felt in a long damn time, and I
love it.
I take another step toward her, closing that distance we created when
Scout interrupted us. I cup her face once more, loving how soft her skin is
under my touch.
“I know I'm not in any position to request something of you, but…can I
kiss you?”
A slow smile spreads over those lips I know taste so damn incredible.
“I thought you'd never ask.”
I don't hesitate, don't waste another second. I capture her mouth with
mine, and a groan leaves me the second our lips collide because kissing her
feels so good, so right. Like coming home after a long road trip, it just feels
right.
I gather her in my arms, hauling her to me, reveling in the way she feels
pressed against me. I know I've only had it once before, but I missed this. I
missed her.
And this kiss? It feels so different than our last one. That one was great,
amazing even, but this? This feels like more than that. It feels like how our
first kiss should have been—us.
I run my tongue along the seam of her lips, loving how she easily opens
for me, giving me a taste of her.
Strawberries.
I love it, and it eggs me on. I slide my hands under her shirt, and she
sighs when my palms coast over her body.
“Ivan…” She groans my name, and if I wasn't holding on to her, I think
my knees might buckle under me at the sound of it falling from her lips.
I kiss her harder, grinding my hips against her so she can feel what she's
doing to me under my running shorts. I have no idea how long we kiss, but
it's long enough for Scout to bang on the back of the truck.
“Wrap it up, you two!” she shouts.
“Yeah! I want donuts, dammit.”
I pull my mouth from Rosie's.
“Is that…”
“Miller?” Rosie finishes for me.
I groan, resting my head against hers. My cock is hard as hell, and there
is no way I'm going to be able to hide it.
“Think of something terrible, Ivan,” I mumble to myself.
Rosie laughs, and it does nothing to help.
“Stop that,” I tell her, pulling away, putting distance between us, hoping
it will help with the situation in my pants. “You're making it worse.”
“By laughing? That's turning you on?”
“Rosie, everything you do turns me on.”
She grins up at me, clearly proud of herself.
“Stop smiling.”
“Why?” she asks, taking a step forward.
I retreat, glaring at her. “You know why.”
She doesn't stop moving toward me, and fucking hell, I'm running out
of space behind me. Truthfully, I'm okay with that. I hope I run out,
because that means I get to touch her again, and I really want to touch her.
“I don't. Can you enlighten me?”
“Rosie…”
“Ivan…” she teases, my name rolling off her lips like it was always
meant to be there.
“You're playing a dangerous game.”
She's close, so damn close if I really wanted to, I could bend down just
slightly, and my lips would be on hers.
She presses up on her tiptoes, narrowing the space between us even
more. “A game I intend to win.”
“Oh, fuck it,” I mutter, then I crush my mouth to hers.
She sighs against me like I haven't kissed her in years, never mind that
we were just locked together.
Another loud knock sounds on the door, and it's enough to break the
kiss.
“Come on, man! I'm fucking starving. My woman didn't make
breakfast this morning.”
“Um, probably because you have two hands that are perfectly capable
of making their own breakfast, you butthole.”
“Did Scout just call Miller a butthole?” I whisper.
“Did you just call me a butthole?” Miller echoes my words
unknowingly.
“You're damn right I did. Keep it up, and I swear, I'm going to pinch
you, Miller.”
“Aw, come on. You know you love me.”
“Not today I don't.”
I can just picture Scout stomping away and Miller chasing after her like
the lovesick man he is.
“Those two are something else,” I remark.
“Yeah, but they're cute together. They work.”
We work.
But I don't say that.
“I should go,” I say instead.
She nods. “I think that's probably best.”
I press one last soft kiss to her lips, then move as far away as possible
before I do something crazy like kiss her again. “Can I make you dinner
tomorrow?”
“Will Carl be there?”
“Yeah, it's kind of her apartment too.”
Her smile is so bright. “Then, yes. I'd love that.”
“Good.” I step toward her but catch myself before I can go any further,
and then I open the back door.
Something hits me before I leave, and I turn back to find her still
watching me.
“Hey, Ro?”
“Yes?”
“Your live streams…do you ever accept private video requests?”
She shakes her head. “No. Never.”
“Good. Keep it that way.”
Then I disappear out of the truck.
Somehow, I don't run into Miller as I leave, and I've never been more
thankful in my life. It's already awful enough I have to run home with my
cock rock hard. I don't need to deal with Miller's crap too, though I'm not
sure it could ruin my mood.
Because kissing Rosie? It's my new favorite thing, and I can't wait to do
it again.

ROSIE
I'm not sure what it says about me, but I spend more time selecting my
outfit for my date at Fitz's place than I do for my live streams where
thousands of people watch me in lingerie.
Maybe it's because I'm far more nervous to spend time alone at his
apartment than I am hitting that Go Live button. I don't know if that means
anything either, but I push the thought away to deal with later. Right now,
I'm just focused on hitting the right floor number.
I double-check our texts from earlier, then hit the button for the
sixteenth floor and hold my breath as the car takes me up, up, up. I was
surprised as hell last night when, after I got home from my classes, there
was a message waiting for me on MyFans from Fitz.
ShootsAndScores: Look, I know I said I'd unsubscribe, and I
promise I will, but I realized I don't have your number. I thought
about asking Greer to get it from Stevie, but then I wasn't sure how
you'd feel about everyone knowing we're dating. So, yeah, here's my
number.
I laughed, then sent him a text, and we set up a time for dinner. He begged
me several times to let him pick me up, but it felt silly and totally
unnecessary since he's cooking me dinner at his place, so here I am, waiting
on the elevator to hit his floor.
A few seconds later, it does, and I blow out the breath I was holding,
trying to calm my racing heart. I have no idea why I'm so nervous for this.
It's not as if it's the first time I've spent time with Fitz, but somehow, that's
exactly what this feels like. Actually, I guess that's what this is—our first
date.
My first date with Fitz.
I reach down and pinch myself because Is this real?
“Ow,” I mutter, rubbing at the spot I just pinched. “Yep, totally real.”
I'm still reeling after his confession in the truck yesterday. He's worried
he's not good enough for me? Is he insane? He's good enough for me and
then some. It was hard to see him so down on himself about his tooth and
his…kink, but I also liked how real it made him seem. He's a professional
hockey player who makes millions of dollars a year; it was nice to see him
knocked down a few pegs and have real-people problems.
I find his apartment at the end of the hall, then lift my hand to knock.
But before I can make contact with the door, it's being pulled open, and
suddenly he's there.
Holy shit, hold my panties he looks incredible.
He's wearing a pair of dress slacks—maybe even the same ones he
made a mess in on Halloween—and a simple gray button-down shirt. The
top few buttons are open, and the sleeves are rolled up, showing off his
impressive forearms. I kind of want to reach out and grab them, confirm
that they're as strong as they look.
He's not wearing any shoes, but he does have on socks, and it's just all
so…cute. I love that he dressed up for an at-home date.
“Hey, you found it okay,” he says, stepping to the side. “Come on in.”
With one last steadying breath, I cross into his apartment.
No turning back now.
Not that I'd want to, but still.
He closes the door behind me, then grabs the peacoat I'm wearing,
tugging the material down my arms. He takes my purse from my hands and
sets it on the table just inside the entryway.
“You look beautiful.” He presses a soft kiss to the exposed skin of my
shoulders. “I love this color on you.”
“Of course you do,” I say, turning to face him. I look down at the silky
dress I'm wearing, loving how it hugs all my curves. “It's orange.”
“So?”
I lift my hands, which I recently refreshed the color on. “You were the
one who requested I paint my nails orange. I just kind of took a guess…”
He steps toward me, and that scent of his I'm so damn familiar with
floods my senses. He reaches up, grabbing hold of a piece of hair that's
fallen from the clip I put it up in. He rubs it between his fingers, looking
into my eyes.
“You wore my favorite color?”
Heat floods my cheeks. Since when did I get all blushy? Until Fitz, I
hadn't blushed in years, but around him, I can't seem to stop.
“Yes,” I confess.
“Good,” he says. “Very good.”
His words transport me back to the Halloween party. He said that exact
same thing to me just before he demanded I take my panties off and stuff
them in his pocket. I have no idea what he did with them since I never got
them back after I rushed out, but a part of me doesn't want to know, nor do
I care. I like knowing he has something of mine hidden around his
apartment.
“Come on,” he says, grabbing my hand and tugging me deeper inside.
“There's someone I want you to meet.”
“Carl?” I ask, practically bouncing on my heels.
“Yep.”
He leads me to the kitchen, where I inhale deeply.
“Ohmygod.” The words come out a moan. “It smells amazing in here.”
“Thanks. I'm not the best cook in the world, but I can whip up a few
things. I hope you're okay with lemon pepper chicken over penne noodles.”
“Are you kidding? That's my favorite! My mom used to make it all the
time.”
“I'm sure this isn't going to be anywhere near as good as hers, but I'm
glad to know it's something you'll like. I probably should have asked first.”
Now he's the one blushing, and all feels right in the world.
He pulls me to a stop in front of the famous pantry, then looks back at
me. “You ready?”
“Yes, but why is she in the pantry?”
“Because if I don't lock her up, she'll escape, and Miss Drake's body
isn't the one I want to see tonight.” He says it so casually, like getting me
naked is a guarantee.
And…I like it. I like how sure he is that this is leading to something
more because I want it to be something more. Like really want it.
“She might run,” he warns, hand on the knob. “One…two…three!”
He pulls the door open, and my heart damn near leaps out of my chest at
the sight before me. There on the third shelf sits a fluffy white and brown
cat right on top of a fresh loaf of bread. She's looking up at us with a glare,
but it doesn't feel mean. It feels full of affection.
“She's on her bread.”
“Her bread is right. I have Carl bread, and I have people bread.”
It's the silliest thing I've ever heard, and possibly the cutest.
Fitz reaches into the pantry and scoops her into his arms.
“You can come out now, you little shit,” he says affectionately, pressing
a kiss to her head. “I want you to meet someone, and you're going to be
nice, and you will not scratch her. Do you understand?”
Meow.
I grin. It's like she can understand him and is answering him.
Fitz turns her until she's facing me, and I tentatively reach out. She
doesn't hiss or arch her back, just lets me run a few fingers over her soft fur.
It takes several strokes, but it's not long until she's purring from my
ministrations.
“Aw, she likes me.”
“She wants you to think she likes you. She's banking on you bringing
her treats. After you do, she'll forget you exist until she's hungry again.”
“From what I've heard about cats, that sounds right.”
He sets her on the floor, and she takes off like a shot, darting to the
other side of the apartment, jumping on her tower with ease.
“Do you have any pets?”
I shake my head. “No. I've thought about it, but I'm nervous. I've never
had one before.”
“Never?”
“Nope. I grew up in kind of a…strict household.”
“Really? That's surprising considering…” He clamps his lips together,
like he doesn't want to finish that sentence.
“Considering the MyFans account I have?” He nods, his cheeks ruddy.
“That's kind of part of the reason I have the account. I didn't really get a
chance to explore much of anything when I was younger. I had one life plan
and that was it, no deviating. Obviously, I did, but even after that, I was still
so…” I tap my finger to my chin, trying to find the right words. “Let's just
say I was a much tamer version of who I am now and spent too much time
letting everyone else make decisions for me.”
Fitz's brows shoot up as he moves around me to the stove, flipping off a
burner, then picking up a spoon and stirring the sauce.
“I can't imagine you being tame. I mean, it's not that you're out of
control or anything, but you're…” He pauses, tipping his head to the side
before settling on: “Strong. You're strong. You know who you are. You're
confident. I like that about you. I like how well you know yourself.”
His words surprise me. I never in my life thought someone would say
I'm strong or confident or that I know myself. I know I've come a long way
from who I used to be, but I don't always feel those things he says I am.
Some days, I still feel like the little girl who had someone telling her how to
live her life.
It's strange to hear Fitz describe me. What's even more strange is how
much I want to be those things…for him.
“God, I'm a terrible host,” he says, setting the spoon to the side and
making his way to the fridge. “Would you like something to drink? I have
wine, beer, soda, water. Dinner is just about ready.”
“Sure, but I can grab it. You finish up what you're doing.”
He nods and goes back to the stove as I round the island and start
opening cabinets to find a glass. It takes me two tries before I get the right
one. I grab two glasses, then open the fridge and pluck out a bottle of
strawberry wine.
I grin, because it's just so…him.
Fitz reaches into the drawer nearest him and pulls free a bottle opener,
then hands it to me without saying a word. And that's how we work—side
by side in complete silence as I pour us some drinks and get the plates set
out on the counter while Fitz finishes up dinner.
It's comfortable, like we do this every day. We don't need to fill the
silence. We're okay with it.
When dinner is ready, Fitz brings the pan to the counter and fills both
our plates. Nothing is said until I take my first bite, and it's me who breaks
the silence.
“Holy hell,” I mutter. “This is incredible. I'd never tell my mom, but
this is a million times better than hers.”
“Come on now. You don't have to lie to me.”
“I'm not! Scout's honor.”
His smile melts my heart…and my panties.
The conversation flows easily, and it feels like this is our hundredth
date, not our first. We talk about the first time we met, when I totally picked
on him for his strawberry donut habit. We talk about Carl and his love for
her. We talk about the boudoir shoot that got me interested in taking sexy
photos. We talk about so much that two hours pass before we even think
about cleaning up dinner.
It's all so easy it feels like I've known Fitz my whole life, and not once
has he judged me for anything I've said or done. He just accepts it. It's a far
cry from anything I've ever experienced before.
“Can I ask you something?” he says as he scoops our leftovers into a
dish. Those damn forearms that are still on display and still look entirely too
lickable stretch with each movement, and I think I could watch him do
mundane things like this forever.
I smile to myself, because isn't that what he's been paying me for?
Watching me do silly, simple things?
“Anything.”
He finishes what he's doing, then sets the dirty pot in the sink. He looks
up at me. “Why don't you do private videos?”
It's not what I was expecting him to ask at all.
I take a sip of my wine and shrug. “I'm not sure. It would definitely
bring in more cash, but to me there's a difference between racy photos and
streaming like I do and doing private videos. Those usually lead to more,
and I don't want that with just anyone.”
He stares at me a moment, and I'm sure it's because my answer is
probably strange to him. Is there a part of me that wouldn't mind doing
private chats? Yeah. I can get pretty hot during the live streams and
sometimes the idea of going into a private room with someone sounds nice,
but I'm always scared of how I'm going to feel afterward.
Will I feel dirty for what I've done? Will I even like it?
“Would you ever do it?”
“With the right person, probably.”
He swallows roughly, then turns on the water, adds soap, and fills the
sink. He stands there with his hands on the counter, his muscles bunched as
he watches the sink fill. His jaw is tight, and it's obvious he's grinding his
teeth. I bet I could hear it if I listened closely enough.
“Ivan?” I say softly, and his head whips up my way. “Are you jealous?”
His knuckles turn white around the spatula he's holding. “I'm not sure
how you want me to answer that.”
“Honestly. We are still doing that, right?”
“Yes,” he says quickly. “To both questions. The answer is yes.”
My shoulders slump, and he sees it.
He drops utensils into the sink, bubbles and water going everywhere. He
rounds the counter, pulling my chair until I'm facing him and he's standing
between my legs. He cups my face, stroking my cheeks just under my eyes
like he loves to do.
“Stop that,” he says roughly. “It's not in the way you're thinking. I'm
jealous because…because I want to be the right person, and I'm terrified
I'm not.”
“I'd do it with you,” I tell him honestly. “I'd be on camera for you.”
“You've already been on camera for me.”
“I know, but you know what I mean. I'd do more for you. Only you.
And if you want me to stop streaming, I'd do that too.”
He's shaking his head before all the words are even out. “No, don't do
that. I…I like it.”
“You like other people watching me?”
He moves his head up and down slowly…like he's afraid to admit it.
“Yes. It's… Fuck,” he mutters. “I don't know. I just know it doesn't bother
me because it's my name that's going to be falling from your lips when you
come.”
My mouth is completely dry. He's okay with me continuing my
streams? He likes it? I'm surprised, especially since I expected him to ask
me to stop, but I realize I'm glad he doesn't. I think he understands how
important this is for me.
“Oh god. Does that make me fucked up? That I'm okay with my girl
being seen practically naked by thousands of people? That I'm okay with
her being watched?”
“No,” I say adamantly. “No. It might not be traditional, but it's not
fucked up. You're not either. I don't know who told you that, but it's not
true.”
He presses his forehead to mine, taking in my words.
“I really want to kiss you right now,” he whispers.
“I really want you to kiss me right now.”
He doesn't waste another moment. His mouth finds mine, and it feels
like coming home.
I just kissed him yesterday, but it somehow feels like it's been years.
I'm so desperate for his mouth, and it's startling because I've never felt this
way about anything before.
I thought before with Levi that I wanted him. Hell, I pined for him for
years, and I thought I knew what that felt like, needing someone so damn
badly you can't breathe.
But I was wrong. So damn wrong. It was nothing compared to what it
feels like with Fitz. I can be kissing him, like now, and still miss him, still
need him.
His hands move from my face to the back of my head, and before I
realize what he's doing, he opens the clip that's holding my hair back and
lets my hair fall free. His fingers tangle in my blonde strands, tugging at
them in that delicious painful-pleasurable way. I should be ashamed of the
moan that leaves me just from him playing with my hair, but I don't care,
not when a low growl rises from his chest.
He hauls me into his arms, picking me up as if I weigh nothing, even
though I have no doubt I'm the heaviest woman he's ever been with. He
sets me on the counter, fitting himself between my legs. He never stops
kissing me, never stops stroking my tongue with his own. His hands
continue to play with my hair, and I think I could probably get off on the
sounds he's making and the way he kisses me alone.
Suddenly, he wrenches his mouth from mine, his hazel eyes full of lust
and need.
“What do you need?” I ask him.
“What we did at the party…” He swallows. “Can we do that again?”
“You want me to touch my pussy while you watch?”
He groans and fire dances across his gaze.
“Yes.” The single word comes out strained, like it's painful for him to
talk.
I shove at his chest lightly, then nod toward the living room.
“Over there,” I instruct, resting back on my palms and crossing my legs.
“Sit.”
He does as I say, dropping into the leather chair, spreading his legs
wide, never taking his eyes off me. His lips are slightly parted, and his
cheeks are flushed. His cock is already straining against his pants, and I've
not done anything yet.
Other than the night of the party, I haven't done this in person. I've
recorded myself privately doing this, just for practice, but never for
someone else. I keep thinking any moment now I'll feel awkward being on
display like this, but I don't. If anything, it's the opposite. This feels
perfectly right.
I'm burning up under his gaze, can already feel sweat beginning to form
on the back of my neck. I'm hot, and it's all because of the way he's staring
at me.
I think maybe I should cool down…
I reach behind me to a fresh stack of dish towels he's set on the counter,
and I grab one. I turn on the faucet and get the rag nice and wet. When I
turn back to him, he's still watching, and when I lift the fabric over my
body and wring it out, letting the cold liquid slide over the silky fabric of
my dress, his chest begins to heave as his breaths intensify.
The material clings to my body, leaving nothing to the imagination. My
nipples are poking through, standing hard and ready, aching to be touched.
With the rag still in one hand, I drag it over my neck, squeezing just enough
to let the water run down my throat and between my breasts, using it to cool
me down. It's just what I needed, and based on the way Fitz is gripping the
armrests of the chair, it's just what he needed too.
I slide my free hand up my body, making sure to go slow and touching
myself like I know he would touch me. I don't stop until I reach my aching
nipple. I rub my thumb over the sensitive bud, letting out a low hiss at the
contact I so desperately needed.
“I'm imagining it's your hands on me, Ivan. Your palms are the perfect
mixture of rough and soft, and they feel so good on my tits, baby.”
A hum of approval leaves him, and it spurs me on. I uncross my legs,
letting them fall apart, giving him a glimpse of the white thong I'm
wearing. His tongue darts out when he gets his first eyeful, and I fucking
love it. I drop the rag, then grab the bottom of my dress, shimmying it
higher so I can spread my legs wider.
“Fuck,” I hear him whisper, and I grin.
I glide my hands over my thighs, getting close to my pussy but not
touching it just yet.
Every time I get close, Fitz inches closer. I do it until he's resting his
elbows on his knees, looking like he can barely hold himself in the chair
any longer. Only then do I slip a hand between my legs and pull my thong
to the side, giving him a look at my center. I drag a single finger through
my folds, shuddering at how fucking good it feels, not just to be touching
myself, but to have him watch me touch myself.
I slip a finger inside my pussy and immediately need to add another
because one just isn't enough, not with how worked up I am.
“Tell me,” he commands gruffly. “Tell me how your hand feels on your
cunt.”
“So good. It's soft and warm and wet. God, Ivan, I'm so fucking wet.
Having your eyes on me…I'm soaking the counter.” I rock against my
hand, squeezing my eyes shut and biting my lip to keep from crying out. “I
wish this was you. I wish these were your fingers inside me, wish you could
feel what I do. My pussy is craving your touch.”
The unmistakable sound of a belt being undone fills the room, and I
open my eyes just in time to see him unzip his pants and pull his cock free.
“Oh god,” I moan, sliding my fingers in and out as he begins stroking
himself.
I've never found dicks particularly nice to look at, but him? He's
beautiful. Not so long it's going to be uncomfortable and just thick enough
that I know I'll stretch perfectly around him.
His movements are lazy and steady, and he never once takes his gaze off
me. He alternates between watching my fingers disappear inside of me and
my face. Every time he looks in my eyes, I tumble closer and closer to the
edge.
As if he knows I'm getting close, he strokes himself faster…harder,
rolling his thumb over the head of his cock.
“That's it, Ro,” he says. “Get yourself there. I want to watch you fall
apart. Make me jealous of those fingers in your pretty cunt. I want to see
what me watching does to you. Coat those fingers with your release.”
His words are just what I need, and with a few more strokes, my orgasm
rocks through me, sliding all the way up my spine and spreading through
my body.
Then suddenly he's there, dropping to his knees between my legs.
He doesn't hesitate, doesn't say a single word. He just knocks my hand
out of the way, pulls my thong down my legs, drags me to the edge of the
counter, and covers my pussy with his mouth. He plunges his tongue into
my hole, groaning when he tastes the evidence of my release. He fucks me
with his tongue just like I was fucking myself with my fingers, then moves
to my clit, sucking it into his mouth with a fervor I've never experienced
before.
A second orgasm races through me before I even realize what's
happening. I grip his head, grinding against his face as I ride it out and even
through the aftershocks. He doesn't pull away, and I honestly don't want
him to. I'm pretty sure I can live the rest of my life with Fitz's face buried
between my legs.
I have no idea how long he slowly eats at me, but it has me shuddering
once more, this orgasm far less powerful than the others but just as
delicious.
When my third orgasm of the night subsides, he finally releases me,
kissing the insides of my thighs softly before falling back onto his
haunches, sucking in breath after breath. His once artfully styled hair is a
wreck, and his face glistens with my cum.
He's never looked hotter.
He grins at me, and I realize I was wrong—now he's never looked
hotter, smiling up at me with that damn toothless grin of his I love so much.
And I realize something scary…
I could get seriously used to this.

FITZ
If I thought I was addicted to watching her before, it's nothing compared to
how I feel now after watching her with her hands on her pussy. When she
first spread her legs and I saw how drenched her cunt was just from rubbing
her hands over her body, it took everything I had not to leap out of the chair.
Then when she fell apart…fuck. It killed me.
I've always been content to just watch, but I wanted to be next to her in
that moment. I wanted to touch her, taste her. I had to.
It was everything I wanted and more.
“I've been dying to know what your thighs feel like wrapped around my
head,” I tell her after I've finally caught my breath.
She quirks a brow. “And?”
“Fucking glorious.” I shove up to my feet and drop my forehead to hers.
“I think I'd like to move in.”
She laughs, but the sound is cut off when I capture her mouth with
mine. She moans when my tongue tangles with hers, and I wonder if it's
from tasting herself. She tastes good enough, that's for damn sure.
I slide my hands under her ass and lift her from the counter, carrying her
through my apartment straight to my bedroom. I drop her onto the bed,
loving how beautiful she looks sitting there. I feed the buttons of my shirt
through the holes, then tug it over my head, tossing it aside. I shove my
pants down my legs along with my boxer briefs, kicking them out of the
way.
Then I reach for her, grabbing the hem of her dress and tugging the silky
material over her head, and step back to admire how she looks. The
luminosity of the moonlight shining through my open window, the way her
pale complexion contrasts with the darkness of my blankets, the soft, dewy
glow of her skin…she looks like a fucking wet dream come to life.
One I intend to have my way with.
I settle back between her legs, loving how she feels underneath me.
“God, your body is incredible,” I tell her, running my hands over every
inch I can reach. “I love how you feel against me.”
“I love how you feel against me.”
“Your curves…” I place a kiss to her collarbone. “They're my favorite.”
“I used to hate them,” she says quietly. “I used to hide them.”
I pull back. “What? Why?”
“Because I was told to.” She shrugs like it's no big deal, but it is. I want
to know who made her feel like she had to hide any part of herself.
“Who? Why?”
“Society. My parents. My…ex-best friend.” Pink creeps into her cheeks.
“It's why I stream—to make myself feel beautiful—and it does. I feel
confident on camera. Desired. Sexy. Wanted.”
I swallow the emotion in my throat because it makes my heart ache that
she's ever felt anything but those things.
“Fuck all those people. You're beautiful. I love every damn dip and
curve you have. You should never, ever hide.”
“I know. I know that now. But sometimes…”
I shake my head. “Ignore the voices. If you ever think you need to hide,
if you ever think you're not good enough, remember what you do to me.
Just watching you gets my cock so fucking hard I can't think straight.” I roll
my hips against her, letting her feel the evidence. “You're perfect the way
you are, Ro, and I promise to remind you of that every goddamn day if I
need to, no matter how long it takes.”
She smiles shyly, and it's still so strange to see her like that. It's a
different side of her she hides so well.
“Okay?” I ask.
She nods. “Okay.”
“Good. Can I start now?”
A laugh bubbles out of her, and she nods. I drop my lips to hers once
more, kissing her with everything I have, making sure she knows I'm not
kidding. She needs to know she's beautiful just the way she is.
I grind my hips against her, letting my cock slide over her heat, loving
how wet and ready she is. If I moved down just a little, I could slip inside of
her with ease. She rocks against me, searching for that friction we both so
desperately seek.
“Ivan…” she whispers. “Please. I need…”
I know what she needs because I need it too.
I pull away and laugh when she reaches for me.
“No,” she protests. “Don't go.”
“Condom,” I explain, pushing off the bed.
“I'm…” She rises up on her elbows. “I'm on birth control.”
I pause at her words. I'm sure it's reckless, probably one of the dumbest
things ever, but just the thought of taking Rosie bare… Fuck.
“Are you sure?”
She nods. “Yes. I'm diligent with it, and I've never had sex without a
condom before.”
I believe her. I know she would never lie to me about something like
this.
“I'm good too. We get tested regularly, and I've never gone without a
condom either.”
She swallows. “Okay.”
“Okay.” I place my knee back on the bed and nod toward the white lacy
bra she's still wearing. “Off. I want to see your tits bounce as I fuck you.”
The hitch in her breath is unmistakable, and she reaches behind her,
undoing the hook, then slips the material down her arms, tossing it to the
side. She leans back on her elbows, letting her legs fall apart.
I lick my lips—fucking literally—at the sight of her glistening cunt.
She's still so damn wet and ready for me, and I love it so much. I want to
take my time with her, want to be gentle and go slow, but I don't think I
can. I need her too damn badly.
I crawl up the bed, fitting myself between her legs, then without another
word or hesitation, I slide inside her. The sound that leaves me is feral as I
sink into the most heavenly place I've ever been before.
“Holyfuckingshitohmygod,” she cries out in one breath. “You're so…oh
god.”
“I know,” I tell her, because I do know. Her pussy squeezes my cock
with the perfect amount of pressure, and I honestly don't have a single clue
how I'm going to last. It's not going to be possible. She feels too fucking
good.
I bury my face in her neck, trying not to blow. “Stop squeezing me.”
She laughs, which only makes her contract around me more.
“Stop it.”
Her body shakes with the laughter I can feel her holding in, and I move
my hips, just to shut her up.
“Fuck,” she moans, and now I'm the one laughing.
I lift my head, grinning down at her. “Not so fun, is it?”
“Actually, this is my exact definition of fun.”
“Mine, too.”
I roll my hips into her again, earning me another moan.
“More,” she begs. “Please.”
I pick up my pace, fucking her with everything I have. We're a mess of
sweat and moans, our skin slapping together, creating the most beautiful
sounds I've ever heard.
I never want this to end. I want to stay buried inside of her until the end
of time.
“Ivan! I…” She doesn't finish her sentence, so lost in her lust.
I push to my knees, not giving up my pace, just changing the angle as I
slide one of her legs onto my shoulder.
“Yes, yes, yes,” she chants when I set my thumb against her clit.
“More.”
“Fuck, Ro, I wish you could see this,” I tell her, watching as I disappear
inside of her. “Your cunt looks so pretty stretched around my cock. Like a
painting you'd see in a museum. Just fucking perfect.”
“So good,” she mutters, her eyes falling shut.
“No.” I stop my movements. “I want to see your eyes when you come.”
She peels her eyes back open, and the look in them as she gazes at me…
fuck, it's going to be burned in my memory for the rest of time.
“Very good,” I mutter, then I slap her clit.
“Ohgodohgod.”
“I've been called a lot of things before, but not God. I'll take it.”
She laughs, but it's short-lived, turning into a full-blown moan when I
press against her clit again and rut against her harder than I have before.
“I'm so close,” she tells me. “So, so…”
“That's it, baby. Milk my cock. Give me all you can.”
One more stroke and her entire body shakes around me as she finds her
release.
“Ivan, Ivan, Ivan,” she says over and over again, keeping her eyes on
me as I continue drilling into her, fucking her through her orgasm.
It's enough to send me over the edge, and I pull out at the last second,
coating her belly in my cum. Seeing her covered in me…god, it's almost
enough to make me blow again, and there's no mistaking the low growl that
leaves me.
“Mine,” I say.
“Yours,” she promises.
Then, to my absolute shock, she reaches down, runs her finger through
it, and lifts it to her lips.
“Holy fuck,” I mutter. I press my lips to hers, not caring about the taste
of my cum on them. I can't not kiss her, not after that.
I couldn't say how long we lie there, but at one point, we're not even
kissing, our mouths just pressed together as we try to catch our breaths. It
takes all my willpower to convince myself to roll off her, and the second I
do, I miss her. So, I grab her by the waist and haul her to me, needing to
feel her.
“That was…” she starts, her fingers tugging at the smattering of hair on
my chest. “Everything.”
Yes, it was.
Because Rosie? She's everything.
And I know for a fact there is no way I'll ever be able to walk away
from her.
Leaving Rosie behind in my bed this morning was the hardest thing I've
ever done, and that includes when I was playing in Vancouver and we made
it to Game Seven and I had to sit on the bench as the other team celebrated
winning the Cup.
She looked so peaceful sleeping. I hated slipping out like I did, but I had
to go. I'm already on thin ice with Coach, and I don't want to get higher on
his shit list.
We landed in Minnesota, then headed straight for the rink for a short
skate to get our legs going. Now we're sitting in the locker room with
twenty minutes to go until we're done for the night. I haven't talked to
Rosie all day, and it's slowly killing me.
“Come on, boys! Get fucking pumped!” Miller slaps his hands together.
“We got this!” He bounces up and down on his skates a few times, then
shakes his hands out.
At least someone is jazzed to be playing hockey. Right now, for the first
time ever, I wish I were back at home and not at the rink, and I know it has
everything to do with the blonde I left in my bed.
“Dude, shut up,” Greer snaps.
Miller ignores him. “We're down two, but that ain't shit. We can
fucking do this.”
“Shut up, Miller,” Rhodes grumbles, looking every bit as salty as Greer
does.
They might be telling him to shut up, but I know they secretly like it
when he tries to pump us up like this. It's worked enough times for them to
believe in it.
The clock in the corner of the room counts down the minutes, and when
we're down to just one, I rise from my temporary stall.
Miller bumps his shoulder against mine. “You ready, Fitzy Baby?”
I grunt at him in response, and he juts his lips out.
“Aw, come on. Don't you be grumpy too. We can get back in this
game.”
“I just want it to be over.”
He tips his head at me, and I get it. I never wish for games to be over,
not even when we're losing. I love being on the ice even when we're down
a few goals. But right now…right now, I want to be somewhere else.
“You got it so bad.”
“Huh?”
He shakes his head, a grin spreading across his lips. “Don't play dumb
with me. You know what I'm talking about. Rosie.” He waggles his brows.
“Someone's totally getting some.”
I don't care that he knows about Rosie and me—I assumed he did from
the other day at Scout's—but it doesn't mean I want him talking about her
or our sex life in any capacity.
I glower at him. “Shut up, Miller.”
He laughs, but only because he knows he's right.
We hit the ice and do a few warmup laps before the period is underway.
“Let's go, boys. Keep your head in it,” Coach says from behind us,
clapping his hands a few times.
The puck is dropped, we win the faceoff—something we've struggled
with all night—and Lowell zips it back to Rhodes, who zings it to Wright.
Our entry to the zone is clean, then the puck is on my stick, and I'm looking
around for a good shot. I got nothing, so I shoot toward Rhodes, who
bounces it over to Wright, who sends it back to me. It's just enough
movement to screw with the other team, and I see my lane. I drag my stick
back and let it rip.
The goalie flips his pad out, stopping the puck, but I'm rewarded with a
juicy rebound, and I shoot it just over his shoulder, sending it right to the
back of the net.
“Fuck yes!” Rhodes shouts, skating over to me and wrapping me in a
hug, a smile on his scarred face.
“Hell yeah!” Wright says, tapping my helmet a few times.
“See? What'd I say?” Miller bumps his glove against mine. “Now, let's
get to work and get this game tied.”
And that's what we do. Two shifts later, Lowell is the one who rips the
puck past the goalie, and suddenly, we're in a tied game. With just over two
minutes left, everyone on the bench is thinking we're heading to overtime.
The arena is buzzing, and the fans are going wild.
I step onto the ice and get right into the play, shoving the opposing
player into the boards. I'm not even out there for five seconds before the
whistle blows.
“You!” the official yells, pointing at me.
“What? What the hell for?”
“Holding.”
Fucking shit. I hang my head, frustrated as hell as he makes the call and
the whole arena cheers. It's the worst feeling, hearing a crowd of thousands
celebrating your demise.
It's a bad call, and based on the way my bench is screaming, they agree
with me, but I don't argue it because I know it's pointless. I climb into the
penalty box, pissed as fuck and wanting to do nothing but break my stick,
but I try to keep my cool. Some guys go nuts over a penalty, but I try not to
let it get to me.
Luckily, Lowell's faceoffs have been much better this period, and he
wins the draw. Normally he'd shoot it down the ice, but Rhodes is there,
and he's on his horse, galloping away toward the Minnesota net. He's not
usually a charger like that, so nobody is expecting it…especially the goalie.
He drags his stick back and shoots. It pings off the crossbar and goes
directly to Wright, who picks up the rebound and zips it past the goalie for
one of the prettiest short-handed goals I've had the pleasure of witnessing.
“YES!” I shout, banging against the glass as the rest of my team goes
nuts, having capitalized on my fuckup.
They manage to kill off the penalty, and with just three seconds left on
the clock, we win the game in the best comeback we've had in years. We're
nothing but smiles as we hit the locker room and get cleaned up, and I don't
even complain when I have to hit the press room. I'm feeling too damn
good.
My high follows me along to the hotel room, and the minute my door
shuts behind me, I have my phone in my hand, ready to call Rosie. I swipe
past the messages of congratulations from my mother, mentally reminding
myself to text her back later, and go right for Rosie's name.
I hit call and wait, settling onto my bed, my back resting against the
headboard of the hotel room that looks exactly like every other I've ever
been in.
It takes two rings before her face fills the screen.
“Hey!” she says with a grin. “How was your night?”
“It was fine.”
“Just fine? Nothing special happened?”
I shrug, unable to keep my smile at bay. “Guess something did.”
Her grin grows wider. “That was a beautiful goal.”
“From who?”
She lifts a brow in warning. “Ivan…”
I swear, just hearing my name causes my cock to stir to life.
“Which did you like better, my goal tonight or the orgasms I gave you
last night?”
“Wow, way to put a girl on the spot,” she jokes before winking at the
camera. The image shakes a bit as she moves through her apartment, and I
don't miss her walking out of her streaming room.
She was online tonight.
I wait for the jealousy to settle into my stomach, but it doesn't come. I
meant what I told her—I don't mind if she still streams because I know I'm
going to be the one she ends up with at the end of the night.
My eyes fall to the rest of her, and I sit forward.
“What are you wearing?”
A seductive grin spreads over her lips. “Oh, this? It's nothing.”
“The fuck it is. Show me.”
She jostles around and sets her phone down, giving me a view of her
empty bed. Then she's there, just at the edge of the frame, and she crawls
onto the mattress, right to the center. A logo I'm more than familiar with
fills the center of her chest.
“Turn around,” I tell her.
She heeds my instruction, spinning around, then looking at the camera
over her shoulder.
“Do you like it?”
Do I like it? Is she nuts?
If she could see how hard my cock is at this moment, she wouldn't be
asking me that.
She's wearing my jersey, and the number 91 and my name stretched
across her back does something to me I wasn't expecting. I've seen plenty
of people wear it before, but never her. It means so much more than she
could ever imagine.
“I swear to fucking god, Ro, you've never been more beautiful.”
She giggles, then goes to turn around.
“Stop!” I shout.
She pauses, a brow raised.
“I want to see more.”
A sly smile pulls at her lips. “How much more?”
“All of it.”
Her teeth sink into her bottom lip as she reaches down, grabbing the
ends of my jersey, then inching it higher and higher. She does it slowly, so
fucking slowly that if I were there, I'd reach over and yank it up myself,
that's how impatient I am right now.
The bottom of her ass peeks out, and I have to physically bite my lip to
suppress my groan. She lifts it higher and higher until her ass is completely
exposed, and that's when it hits me.
She's not wearing any underwear.
“Did you wear that on your stream?”
She shakes her head. “Nope.”
“Good.” I'm okay with her streaming, but I want this part of her to
myself. “Show me more.”
“More?”
I nod. “Bend over, baby. I want to see all of you.”
Her lips part and I can hear the stuttered breath that leaves her, then
slowly, she does as I asked. Her hips fold over, the jersey inching higher
with her movements, and I watch with rapt attention.
She peeks at me over her shoulder, her bare ass up in the air, completely
exposed to me, and I commit this moment to memory.
“Holy shit,” I mutter, and she giggles, causing her ass to jiggle, and the
desire to see my palm print on it hits me out of nowhere. I've never really
been one for spanking, but right now, I want to see Rosie covered in my
handprint so damn badly. “You're perfect.”
“Thanks,” she says quietly, squeezing her legs together. She's just as
turned on as I am, and I love it.
“Have you ever played with your ass before, Ro?”
Her eyes widen slightly, but she nods. “A few times.”
“Good. Do you have any toys?”
“Yes.”
“Can you grab one?”
Another nod before she's sitting up and moving to her bedside table. I
rip my shirt off over my head and undo my pants but leave my cock tucked
inside of my underwear. I can't see at all what she's grabbing and am
stunned when she returns with a little silver plug in her hand.
“Yes.” The word comes out as a moan. “That one. Please.”
Her eyes fill with mischief as she resumes her position, giving me a full
view of her asshole. For what feels like the tenth time in the last hour, I
wish I wasn't on the road, and I wish I'd had more time with her last night
so I could have explored her body properly.
Next time.
She rests her weight on one shoulder, then reaches between her legs. I
see the plug peek through a few times as she uses it to rub against her clit. I
can see it glistening with each passing stroke, then suddenly it's gone, and
she reaches around herself, pressing it against her tight hole.
“Oh god,” she moans as she begins to push it in, and I watch as her ass
stretches around the toy.
“Talk to me, Ro. What's it feel like?”
“So good,” she mumbles. “So, so good. But I bet your cock would feel
even better.”
“Has anyone ever fucked you there before?”
She shakes her head the best she can. “No. Never.”
“Good. Because that ass is mine.”
“All yours,” she agrees, inching the toy in further.
When it's fully seated, I get my first real look at it. There's a little pink
gem on the end, and it shimmers in the soft light of the room.
She looks gorgeous, absolutely fucking stunning.
“I wish I was there,” I tell her.
“Me too.” A soft moan leaves her when she shifts around. “I feel so
full.”
“Just think how it'll feel when my cock is in your cunt and you're
wearing it.”
She lets out another moan, and I palm my dick, pressing on it to relieve
some of the ache that's building.
“Do you want to come?”
“Please.”
“Put your hand on your clit, Ro. Get yourself off. Pretend I'm there and
it's my hand fucking you.”
She doesn't hesitate, just slips her hand between her legs and begins
rubbing herself. I'm not surprised when just thirty seconds later, she's
falling apart.
“Oh, fuck. Ivan. Yes, just like that.”
I lied before. This is the most beautiful sight, Rosie with a plug in her
ass and her hand on her pussy, calling out my name.
I reach into my pants and pull myself free, gripping my length and
giving myself just three short strokes before I'm coming all over my lap as
her shudders continue to rack through her. When I've drained the last of my
cum, I sink back against the headboard, completely spent.
Rosie is still up on her knees, her eyes shut and looking every bit as
tired as I am.
“Ro?” I say softly.
“Hmm?” She peels her eyes open and looks at me, giving me a lazy
satisfied grin.
I laugh at how sleepy she looks. “Go to bed.”
She nods, then pushes herself up, another noise of pleasure leaving her.
She turns around, facing the camera once more, and I don't think I'll ever
get over the sight of her wearing my number.
“How, um…” She chews on her lip. “How was that? For you, I mean.
That was my first time…”
“Mine too,” I tell her, “and I'm not sure it can get better.”
Her eyes light up. “Really?”
“Really. You did so good, baby.”
She smiles, then tucks a strand of hair behind her ear. “Thank you.”
“Now, go to bed. You have an early morning tomorrow.”
“Ugh, I know.” She rolls her eyes. “I swear, when I open my own
bakery, I'm not doing early mornings.”
“You mentioned that before with…” I trail off, not wanting to remind
her of when I tricked her with my identity. “Is that something you want to
do soon?”
She looks startled a moment, then nods. “Yes. I'm taking classes to get
my business degree.”
“No shit? That's awesome.”
“It's not a big deal. I still have a long time left before I graduate.”
“Hey, no. Don't do that.” I give her a hard look. “Don't sell yourself
short. You're busting your ass at Scout's, you're streaming, and you're
going to school? That's fucking amazing. Be proud of that.”
“I… Thanks,” she murmurs, her focus anywhere but at the screen.
“Ro?” She peers up at me with uncertain eyes. “I'm proud of you.”
“So you don't think I'm an ungrateful moron?”
“What? No. Why would I think that?”
“Well, Scout and Stevie have done so much, letting me run that truck.
Wouldn't that be me throwing it in their faces?”
“Do you really think they'd think that?”
She twists her lips back and forth a few times before finally shaking her
head. “No.”
“Yeah, I don't either. They'll support the hell out of you, even when you
kick ass and steal all of Scout's customers. You're going to be amazing at
it.”
“Thank you.” She smiles softly, then grabs her phone, bringing it closer,
and I love how bright her eyes look in the light of her screen. “Hey, Fitz?”
“Hmm?”
“I wish you were here.”
I sigh heavily. “Me too, Ro. Me too. Good night.”
“Good night…Ivan.”
With reluctance, I end the call. I take a quick shower to clean myself up,
then crawl into bed alone, wishing like hell Rosie was here and not over a
thousand miles away.
I can't wait for this road trip to be over.

ROSIE
“Can I just say that the fact that we're all here is the best thing ever? I love
afternoon games because it gives us a better chance at getting everyone
here.”
I glance over at Harper, who is grinning down the aisle at us.
She, Ryan, Hollis, Emilia, Scout, Stevie, and I are all sitting together.
Even little Freddie and Macie are here, each sitting next to their mom.
Hollis' new baby is at home with her grandma since she's too tiny for the
rink just yet.
This isn't my first Comets game and I know it won't be my last, but it's
my first time getting to sit with all the wives and girlfriends of the core
group. It's so nice to be included in this, and tears are jumping to my eyes. I
never, ever thought my crush on Fitz would land me here, sitting with all
these badass women.
I blink them away, hoping nobody sees.
“It's about time we got all of our schedules to work out,” Ryan says.
“Between your booming prop business, my demanding YouTube schedule,
Hollis being a kick-ass mom of two, Emilia keeping our idiots in line, Scout
running her truck and her author career, Stevie being an overall badass, and
Rosie doing her thing…”
“It's a wonder we ever hang out at all,” Hollis finishes for her, bouncing
her adorable daughter who is wearing the cutest headphones ever on her
knee.
“I for one still can't believe we pulled Scout away from her laptop,”
Stevie says pointedly to her sister.
“Hey! I'm on a deadline!”
“You're always on a deadline.”
Scout shrugs her comment off.
“I'm just glad Rosie and Fitz finally pulled their heads out of their asses
and decided to get together.” Stevie giggles at her own words.
“Hey!” I protest. “I'm sitting right here.”
“I know, and I meant what I said.”
“Um, Mom, you can't say ass, remember?”
“You're right, Macie. I meant I'm glad Rosie and Fitz decided to pull
their heads out of their jackasses.”
“Again, right here,” I say.
She ignores me, and so does everyone else, but truthfully, I'm not mad
about her words. I'm glad we're together too.
When Fitz finally got home from his road trip, the first thing he did was
show up at my apartment. I questioned him as to how he got my address,
but then I realized I didn't care and threw myself into his arms. He carried
me right to the couch, dropped to his knees, and showed me just how much
he missed me by eating me to orgasm twice before finally letting me ride
his cock until he came inside of me.
We spent the rest of the night in my bed and have spent the last three
weeks alternating between his place and mine. During his away games, we
spend our nights on video chat. I used my plug again, and once he let me be
the one to watch as he jacked himself to release. It was so hot and made me
really understand his desire to just sit back and observe.
Of course, when we got off the video, I used my rabbit toy to get off…
twice.
It's not all about the sex, though. I've spent more time talking to Fitz in
the last three weeks than I have in the last year I've known him, and I
learned his obsession with strawberries extends past donuts. Honestly, it's a
little scary how much he loves them, but that's his problem, not mine.
He told me about his childhood and his parents and how supportive his
mom is of his hockey career. I caught him on the phone with her one
morning, and seeing him blush every time she called him “Baby Boy” was
the cutest thing ever.
I'm so damn happy with him that I couldn't stop smiling even if I tried.
I'm not usually a grumpy person by nature, but this happiness feels like
something so much more.
He feels like something so much more.
He makes me feel seen and desired, and he's so damn supportive of
everything I do that sometimes I have to stop and stare at him, wondering
what I did to deserve it all. Then I remember…I don't have to do anything
to deserve it. I do deserve it, full stop.
It's such a weird feeling, and now that I've experienced it…I never want
to let it go.
“Stop it,” Stevie hisses, jabbing me with her elbow.
“Oof!” I grab my boob. “What was that for?”
“You're grinning like an idiot and it's scaring people. Especially that
kid.” She nods toward a little boy who is peering up at us, his eyes wide
with fear.
I wave at him, and he hides behind his mother, who then turns around
and shoots us a glare. The moment she turns back around, Stevie and I
giggle like schoolgirls.
“This is so much fun,” she says, and I nod. “By the way, I can't thank
you enough for volunteering to let Macie come over after the game. She
will not stop going on and on about wanting a pet, and I know Fitz has a
cat. I tried to get Ryan to agree since she and Rhodes have pets, but…”
“Rhodes is…well, Rhodes?”
She laughs. “Yes. And Harper and Collin have so much creepy stuff
around their house that I don't want her to get scared.”
“That's fair.” Harper runs her business out of her house. Pair her horror
prop business with her obsession with all things horror, and it's safe to say
their house is not kid friendly. “It's no problem at all. We're looking
forward to it. Fitz even went out and bought snacks for the playdate.”
“But not sugary snacks, right?”
“No, of course not.”
It's a lie, a complete and total lie. In fact, I'm pretty sure sugar is all he
bought.
She nods, seemingly satisfied with my answer, then shoots to her feet
when the guys hit the ice for the last period.
I was surprised during the warmups when they all took turns skating
over here. I was even more surprised when Fitz did the same. He skated
right up and bumped his stick against the glass, then pointed at me, sending
me a full smile, missing tooth and all.
I melted right there.
They're up three goals at the beginning of the period but refuse to take
their foot off the gas, and by the end of the game, they add another three to
the score sheet without giving anything else up. I don't think a single soul
leaves the building as they announce the three stars of the game: Greer for
his saves, Fitz for his assists, and Miller for all the goals he racked up.
“A natural freakin' hat trick? My man is the best! I need to change my
panties.”
“Scout!” Stevie glares at her younger sister, then slides her eyes toward
her daughter, who is very much paying attention to what's being said.
“Pantyhose,” Scout says in an attempt to cover her blunder. “I need to
change my pantyhose.”
Macie wrinkles her nose. “Why are you wearing pantyhose with jeans,
Aunt Scout? Mom only makes me wear those with dresses on Easter or
Christmas.”
Scout mumbles something to her niece, then begins shuffling out of the
aisle as the rest of the arena clears out. I stifle a laugh, following behind
them closely.
Flashing our badges to the security team, we make our way through the
back hallways to the parking garage where we're meeting the guys. One by
one, they all come out of the arena, every player wearing a smile, still flying
high from their incredible win.
“Jackass!” Macie yells, running from her mother's side and into Greer's
arms. “You did so good! I mean, it would have been cool to get a shutout,
but only letting in one goal is amazing.”
He squeezes his girlfriend's daughter tightly. “Thanks, kid. I can always
count on you to tell me my weak points.”
“You're welcome,” Macie says, not picking up on his sarcasm at all.
“Hey, Rosie,” Greer says, lifting his hat and running his hand through
his hair before placing the cap back where it belongs. “We appreciate you
letting Macie hang out for a bit.”
I wave him off. “No biggie, really. We're excited.”
He leans into me and whispers, “Between you and me, if she starts
driving you nuts and you put Miracle on, she'll be out within the first thirty
minutes. She loves the movie, but she's seen it too many times. It's
basically cinematic Benadryl at this point.”
I nod, smirking at him. “Thanks for the tip.”
“Fitz!” Macie yells, promptly abandoning us. She races up to him and
bumps her fist against the one he's holding out. “Does Carl like mac and
cheese? I can make her some.”
“Um…” Fitz's eyes shoot to Stevie, who is shaking her head, then he
looks back at Macie. “You know what? She doesn't, but I love mac and
cheese.”
“Really? I mean, it's not mac and cheese night, but I can whip some up
for us if you're hungry.”
He pats his stomach, the one I know for a fact is practically an eightpack, and grins at her. “Oh, man. I am starving. I'd love that.”
“Yes!” She bounces up and down on her heels, then skips to Fitz's truck.
I have a feeling we're in for a long night. Who knew a kid would have
this much energy at this time of night?
“Hey, where's your mom's kiss, kid?”
Macie sighs dramatically but goes to her mother, wrapping her arms
around her and squeezing her tightly. Stevie kisses the top of her head, then
Greer steps up, accepting the hug Macie gives him. It's still so strange to
see grumpy Greer in a dad role, but it suits him so much more than I ever
expected.
“Be good for Rosie and Fitz, all right?” She nods. “And if you need
anything at all or want to come home early, just call, okay? We'll come to
get you like that.” He snaps on the last word, just to emphasize it.
Macie giggles. “I will.”
She gives him another hug, then heads back to the truck. When I look
back at Stevie and Greer, both are staring after her like their whole heart is
walking away.
We say our goodbyes, and they pile into Greer's fancy sports car, then
peel out of the garage.
“Who wants a strawberry smoothie?” Fitz asks.
“Oooh! Me, me, me!” Macie says, opening her door. “But can I get
mango instead?”
He gives me a look that says Can you believe this kid? “I'm not sure
why you'd pass up strawberries, but sure.”
I shrug, then climb in behind her.
Yeah, this is totally going to be a long night.
“Eight…nine…ten…eleven…twelve! Holy smokes!” Macie claps her
hands together. “You can fit twelve sour worms in your gap? That's better
than the four straws and the six Twizzlers.”
Fitz grins proudly like he's just as excited about this as she is. He uses
his tongue to pull them out, then chews them all at once and swallows.
“Pretty awesome, right?”
“Best. Day. Ever.”
They high-five, and I can't seem to wipe the smile off my face watching
them. I'm pretty sure after this evening, Macie is going to tell everyone else
to get lost and proclaim Fitz as her best friend, and honestly, I don't blame
her. He's pretty amazing.
When we got back to Fitz's place, he patiently introduced her to Carl,
who took a few minutes to warm up to the hyper kid, then quickly became
attached to her. In fact, the cat is currently curled up inside Fitz's hoodie,
which Macie is currently wearing. Another odd little thing I learned about
the brown and white cat—she loves to sit inside hoods.
After introductions, Macie did make us some mac and cheese. She
complained there were no hot dogs or baked beans to put in it but was
happy with the results after Fitz let her crush up Cheetos and crumble them
over the top.
It was surprisingly good.
Afterward, I whipped up a quick batch of peanut butter caramel cookies.
“Fu—”
“Fitz,” I warn him.
He widens his eyes, mid-bite. “Frick,” he amends. “These are amazing.
When you open your own bakery, you have to put these on the menu!”
“You're going to open your own bakery?” Macie's eyes are wide too.
“Can I come hang out there? Don't tell Aunt Scout I said this, but
sometimes the donut truck gets boring, and sometimes I just want cookies
instead of donuts.”
“Of course you can come hang out with me,” I tell her. “But it probably
won't be for a while. You'll be a teenager and way too cool for me.”
“I'm too cool now, but I still like you.”
Fitz lifts his hand for a high five, and Macie smacks her palm against
his.
I grab my chest. “Ow. That one hurt.”
“You still love us.” The kid shrugs, then looks at Fitz. “What about
Raisinets? How many of those will fit in your gap?”
His eyes widen, and he looks at me with panic in his expression.
“How about we put a movie in?” I suggest.
“Yes!” the kid shouts loudly. “Do you have any hockey movies?”
“Hello, hockey player here.” He rolls his eyes. “Of course I do. Come
on.”
We get Miracle loaded up and gather enough pillows and blankets for
about ten people, then snuggle up on the couch.
Turns out, Greer was right. We're not even thirty minutes into the
movie, and Macie is passed out. And she's snoring—like a full-grown-man
kind of snoring. It's cute until it's not anymore.
Luckily, we don't have to listen to it for long. Stevie and Greer show up
at eight like we planned.
“Thanks again, man,” Greer says to Fitz, lifting Macie into his arms.
She doesn't even stir when he jostles her around. She's definitely out for the
night, and I don't blame her. It was a big day for her between the game and
hanging out with Carl. “We really needed those few hours alone.”
“Any time you guys need a break, just let us know,” Fitz tells him.
My heart stutters at his words.
Us. Let us know.
I love how easily it rolled off his tongue, like it was always meant to be
there.
“We will. Good night.” He looks at me, then back at Fitz before leaning
in and not-so-quietly saying, “Don't do anything I wouldn't do.”
I roll my eyes at him, and Fitz slams the door in his face. I hear Greer
laugh on the other side.
“I was not aware that sound could come out of a child,” Fitz says,
shaking his head as he goes to the couch and begins cleaning up the mess of
blankets we've made. “None of my nieces snore like that. It's new
territory.”
“Do you get to see them often?” I grab one of the extra blankets and put
it inside the basket near the couch. For a guy, his place is surprisingly
organized and well-decorated. I briefly wonder if his mother came and
helped him. That would be a total Fitz thing.
He shrugs. “A few times a year. Not as much as I'd like, obviously.
They live in Arizona, so I always make sure to get them tickets to games
whenever we play there. Last season, I scored two goals with them in the
crowd, and since we had a day off the next day, I got to go to their showand-tell. It was awesome.”
His whole face is lit up talking about them, and it's a side of him I
haven't really gotten to see yet. I love it.
“Do you want kids?” The second I realize what I've just asked, I stop
dead in my tracks, spinning to face him. “Oh my god, forget I asked that. It
was totally out of line. I mean, we've only been dating for a month. That's
like a one-year-mark kind of question. I have no business asking you
questions like that. I mean, I'm nob—”
Fitz covers my mouth with his hand, his hazel eyes narrowed on me. “I
swear, if you say something ridiculous like you're nobody, I will be forced
to take you back to my room and spank your ass.”
“But, like, in a sexy way, right? A sexy spanking?”
“Do you really think you'd deserve a sexy spanking after that?”
“Yes.”
His eyes spark with lust, a smirk pulling one side of his mouth up.
“You're…”
“Amazing? I know.”
He laughs. “Something, Ro. You're something.” Another smirk. “To
answer your question, yes, I do want kids. But not for another few years.”
I'm suddenly hit with so many images all at once. The one that sticks
out the most is of me, Fitz, and a little girl with blonde hair and hazel eyes
smiling up at us as we stand at the kitchen counter all wearing matching
aprons and making cookies. Fitz boops the tip of her nose, leaving behind a
speck of flour. She giggles, and it's the sweetest sound I've ever heard.
“What are you thinking about?” he asks.
“Us,” I answer honestly. “Future us.”
“Yeah?” I nod. “I like the sound of that.”
Before I know what's happening, he grabs my hand, hauling me down
the hall toward his room.
Only we don't make it. He presses me against the wall halfway there,
then covers my mouth with his own. His tongue pushes past my lips, sliding
against mine. He tastes like my peanut butter cookies, and I love it more
than when he tastes like strawberry donuts. Those aren't mine, not really.
But this? It's all me.
He grinds his hips against me, and I can feel his hardening cock against
my leg, which tells me…
“We should really move this to the bedroom.” I grab his hand and drag
him the rest of the way.
The second he closes the door, I pounce. This time, it's me pressing him
against the door and covering his mouth. He groans as our tongues tangle
together, and he's so damn lost in the kiss I don't think he even realizes I
have his belt buckle in my hand and I'm undoing it, or that I drag his zipper
down. In fact, I don't think he realizes what's happening until I wrench my
lips from his and fall to my knees.
“Oh, fuck…” He stares down at me with glassy eyes. “You look
beautiful like that.”
“Do I?” I tug his jeans down his legs, dragging his boxer briefs along
with them. “Your cock is so perfect,” I tell him when it springs free. “I've
been thinking about sucking it all day.”
A low growl rumbles out of his chest, and I love it so damn much my
pussy throbs just from the sound alone. I lean forward and run my tongue
along his shaft, from base to tip.
“Christ,” he mutters, staring down at me. I know because I haven't
taken my eyes off his the entire time.
I lick him again, then again, like he's a lollipop and I'm dying to know
how many licks it takes to get him to explode.
“You're a terrible tease.” He reaches for me, and I shake my head.
“Hands on the door, Fitz.”
His eyes spark, and with one nod, he listens, flattening his palms against
it, earning himself another lick for following directions. He lets out a low
groan, and I smile against his cock.
“You're killing me,” he says, but I know that's not true. He loves being
teased like this as much as I love teasing him. The anticipation…the
buildup…it's important to him.
I continue to run my tongue along his shaft, occasionally sucking the
head of his cock into my mouth and applying enough pressure to drive him
crazy. The longer I lick at him, the more I get impatient. I have no doubt in
my mind that were I to reach my hand between my legs, I would find I'm
soaking wet.
“Ro…” he whines, driving his hips toward me.
He needs more, and fuck it because so do I. This time when I run my
tongue along him, I don't pull back. Instead, I cover his cock with my
mouth and pull him straight to the back of my throat.
“Fuckingshitohgod.” It comes out as one word, and I smile when I hear
his head hit the door.
I deep-throat him until I can't breathe, then pull back. I suck in a few
breaths of air and then swallow him again. His hands are literally shaking
against the door, and I know he wants to reach out and touch, so I grab his
hand and bring it to my head.
“Finally,” he grunts, tipping my head toward him. He holds my eyes
with his own. “I'm going to fuck your mouth so hard, baby.”
I nod, begging him to do his worst, and he does. He ruts into me, using
my mouth and using me. He drives into me over and over, and I love every
second of it.
“I want to come on your tits,” he tells me, pulling out. “On the bed.”
I shove up to my feet and rip my shirt off over my head, so glad I wore
a front-clasp bra as I tug that off too. I lie back on my elbows as he stands
over me, stroking himself. He never once takes his eyes off me as he grips
his cock tighter and faster, fucking his fist as I wait for my reward.
The muscles in his neck jump as his entire body tenses, and just two
strokes later, he coats my tits in his cum. I love every fucking second of it. I
love when he marks me like this. It makes me feel like…well, his.
When he squeezes out the last of his orgasm, I reach down and run my
finger through the mess he's made, then lick it off because I know it drives
him wild, and honestly, it drives me wild too. His eyes light with a fire I've
never seen before, and before I know what's happening, he yanks my
leggings down along with my underwear, runs his fingers through the
remnants of him, and then pushes them inside my already drenched pussy.
“Holy…” I whisper.
But he's not done. Of course he's not.
He drops to his knees, shoves my legs open wide, and presses his mouth
to my clit while he continues to fuck me with his fingers. He gives my cunt
two more strokes before sliding them out of me and down to the hole only
I've played with so far.
I'm up on my elbows watching him, so I don't miss when he peers up at
me, asking for permission.
“Do it,” I tell him. “Stretch my ass with your fingers.”
He growls against me, then slowly begins slipping his digit inside of
me. It feels different than the plug but just as good. He works one finger in,
then another, and quickly, I'm riding his hand, aching for more.
“You look fucking gorgeous with my fingers in your ass, Ro. I can't
wait until it's my cock buried inside of you.”
“I can't…either,” I manage to get out, completely lost in this sensation,
loving how full I feel with him inside me like this, already anticipating what
it's going to feel like when it's his cock.
He sucks my clit back into his mouth as he works his fingers in and out
of my ass, and my orgasm hits me out of nowhere.
“Ivan!” I cry out his name as shudders make my entire body shake. I've
never felt an orgasm like this before, and that's saying something because
I've had quite a few of them since Fitz and I started seeing one another.
Is this normal? Will it always be like this? Better and better each time?
When the last of my trembling subsides, he slowly pulls his fingers
from my ass, then gives my pussy one last kiss before crawling his way up
my body. He peppers me with kisses, covering my body with his own.
“How the hell did I get so lucky?” he whispers against my lips.
I don't tell him I've been asking myself the same thing.
Because this thing with Fitz? It's real…and I never want it to change.

FITZ
“Move the puck, move the puck!” our special teams coach yells. “We want
surprise. We don't want to be predictable.”
I slide it against the ice toward Rhodes, who barely touches it before
shooting it to Wright, who then feeds it to Miller. He looks for an opening,
but when he doesn't find anything, he sends it my way. It's not even on my
stick for a second before it's back to Miller, then in the back of the net.
“Yes!” Miller shouts, like this is a real game and not just practice.
“You got lucky,” Greer grumbles, tugging his goalie mask off and
setting it on top of his head as he reaches for his water bottle. He drenches
himself with water, then shakes his head. “Let's go again.”
We run the play again and score again. Then we switch it up, me taking
Miller's spot. The same thing happens—the puck goes right into the back of
the net.
Greer is obviously unhappy, but the rest of the team is feeling damn
good about it.
“That's the winner,” the goalie says on our way to the locker room. “If
you guys can move it like that out on the ice, get someone in front of the net
to screen the goalie and tip the puck in, you're fucking golden.”
“Good thing too, because we've been shit on the PP lately. Don't get me
wrong, our five-on-five is awesome and we're obviously winning games,
but we need a PP as dangerous as our PK.”
Miller snickers. “You said PP.”
Everyone rolls their eyes, but there's no missing the way several guys
smirk. We might all be adults and professional athletes, but we're also guys.
We're going to laugh every time someone abbreviates power play to PP. It's
inevitable.
“Fitzy Baby, are you and Ro coming over for Thanksgiving dinner?”
Rhodes asks.
“At your house?” I don't even bother trying to mask the surprise in my
voice. There's a reason his nickname is Beast, and it's not just his scar. He
lives in a house up on a hill that's dark and spooky-looking and he never
invites anyone over. I've been dying to ask Ryan if the dishes talk, but I'm
sure she'd deny it even if it was true.
“Yeah. It's my turn to host. Ryan's excited about it, so I guess I am too.”
I try not to laugh because based on the frown gracing his face, that's not
even remotely true.
“We'll be there. Need us to bring anything?”
“Maybe a pie or some other dessert? I mean, I'm sure we'll have plenty,
but then again…”
I understand what he's getting at. There's going to be an assload of
hockey players in his house, so there's no such thing as too much food. I
smile to myself thinking of last weekend when Macie was over for her
playdate with Carl and she yelled at me for eating a whole box of mac and
cheese myself.
“We can do that,” I tell him, then I grab my phone from my cubby.
Me: I kind of just agreed to go to Rhodes' house for
Thanksgiving. Is that okay?
Dots pop up on the screen almost immediately.
Rosie: Of course! Besides, Ryan stopped by earlier this
morning and already asked. I told her yes.
Rosie: Now I'm realizing I should have checked with you first.
Rosie: We're bringing pie. And probably cookies.
Rosie: I have to run by the store and grab some ingredients
after my shift at the truck. Want to come?
Me: Sure. Want me to pick you up?
Rosie: I'd love that. : )
I feel my own smile tug at my lips.
“What are you looking at? Porn?” Hayes drops down into the stall next
to me, even though it's not his. He tries to peek over my shoulder. “Is it that
hot lady you were watching on the plane that one night?”
I snap my head up to him.
How the hell…
He shrugs. “I saw you watching before I decided to catch some shuteye. I have no idea what was going on, but that little red number she was
wearing was nice.” He bites his bottom lip and closes his eyes like he's
conjuring up the image right here and now.
My phone creaks in my hand and I glance down, surprised to find my
knuckles turning white around the device. I'm not bothered by strangers
watching Rosie on her streams, but I really don't like the idea of Hayes
watching her. It one hundred percent has to do with who he is—a
womanizing little shit.
“Don't worry,” he says. “I don't know what channel it was or anything,
so I'm not whacking off to the stuff you are.”
I blink at him, trying to decide if I want to kill him or not. I think I'd do
okay in jail, but I'd miss hockey a whole hell of a lot.
“What?” he asks.
“Nothing,” I mutter. “Go away.”
He sighs, then shoves up to stand. “You're no fun anymore. None of
you guys are. You're all paired off, all falling in love and shit. I'm lonely
over here, man.”
“I'm not fall—”
His laughter cuts me off. “Don't even fucking try it, Fitz.”
“Try what?”
“Denying you're falling in love with that thick woman from the donut
truck.”
“Rosie,” I say through clenched teeth, my patience with him growing
thin. “Her name is Rosie.”
“Whatever. I'm just calling it like I see it. You're clearly into her.”
“Well, yeah. We're dating.”
“No, man.” He shakes his head. “You're more than dating. You're in
love with her.”
I smash my brows together. “No.”
“Yes,” he insists. He dips his head toward Greer. “I saw that idiot fall in
love with my own two eyes earlier this year, and you're acting just like he
did: all smiley and always attached to your phone, always ditching me to
hang with your girl. You're in love.”
Do I smile a lot since I started dating Rosie? Yeah. She makes me
happy. Am I attached to my phone? Sure, but that's because I always want
to talk to her. And do I ditch Hayes? Yes, but to be fair, I've been trying to
shake the kid for a while now. I like him just fine, but his idea of a good
time and mine are two totally different things.
All that said, am I in love with Rosie? No. There's no way. We've only
been dating a little over a month now. That's too soon, right?
When I don't say anything, he sighs and claps me on the shoulder. “You
just go ahead and figure that one out for yourself. I'm going to go find
someone else to hang with.” He starts to cross the room. “Hey, Ford. I—”
“No,” the new guy says, not even looking up at him. “I'm not hanging
out with you.”
Hayes drops his shoulders and hangs his head, mumbling and walking
out looking completely dejected. I feel a little bad for him and promise to
make time for him after Thanksgiving.
I work on stripping off my gear as the space starts to clear out, everyone
either heading home or to the gym a few rooms over.
“You know he's right,” Ford says quietly, startling me.
I turn around to find him staring right at me with sharp eyes. “Huh?”
“The kid—he's right. You're clearly in love with this Rosie girl.”
“How would you know?”
He lifts a shoulder. “Because a man in love knows another man in love.”
“You're in love?”
A faraway look crosses his features, a smile tugging at the corners of his
lips. “Oh yeah. Tessa came out of nowhere at the start of the season, and
now I can't get enough of her. I hate going on the road, hate leaving her.
Hell, I think I'd even give up hockey if she asked me to.”
I swallow roughly because fuck me. I've had those exact thoughts.
I used to be okay with the travel that comes with the game—it's fun
seeing different cities and exploring—but now? Now it grates on me every
time I have to say goodbye. I just want to be close to Rosie.
And hockey? I still love it, but I love being with her even more.
Ford laughs lowly, bringing my attention back to him. “You have that
same look on your face I see in my own reflection, and I definitely love my
woman.” He shoves out of his stall, then tosses his bag over his shoulder.
“See you at Thanksgiving,” he calls out as he makes his way from the room,
leaving me standing there all alone with nothing but my thoughts and the
reality that…
He may be right.
I think I'm in love with Rosie.
“Remind me again why we're going to the grocery store on Thanksgiving?”
“Because we need flowers.”
“For?”
“Um, our hosts.” Rosie sends me an incredulous look. “Duh.”
I smother a laugh. “Right. Flowers. Duh.”
She narrows her eyes at me, then points to the door. “Hush up and open
that for me.”
“Yes, ma'am,” I say, stepping in front of her so the automatic doors can
swing open.
She brushes past me. “Thank you.”
Wiping the grin off my face is impossible. She's ridiculous, and I
fucking love it. I've had more fun with Rosie than I've ever had in my
entire life. She's full of fire and wit, and hanging out with her is my new
favorite pastime.
Ford was right—I can't get enough of her, and I'm not sure I ever will.
She leads us through the corner market to the back of the store where
there's a small cooler full of several different kinds of flowers. I try not to
watch her ass the entire time, but it's hard. She's wearing that orange dress
again, and all I can think of is the last time she had it on, her sitting up on
my counter pouring water all over her chest, then fingering herself. And of
course, that leads me to remembering what it's like between her legs.
Pure fucking bliss.
I usually love Thanksgiving and the endless supply of turkey and carbs,
but right now, I'd be perfectly fine with going back to my apartment and
having Rosie for dinner.
She taps her manicured finger against her chin. “I love daisies
personally, but should we stick with something traditional like roses? They
are fancier.”
When I don't answer her, she peeks over at me.
“What?”
“Nothing,” I tell her.
“It's something. You're smiling at me. What?”
I can't stop myself from gripping the faux fur jacket she's wearing and
dragging her to me, and I really can't stop myself from slanting my mouth
over hers, kissing her in a manner that's entirely inappropriate for the
grocery store. I slip my hands around her waist, unabashedly trailing them
lower until I'm cupping her ass and tugging her as close as possible.
She wraps her arms around my neck, holding me just as tightly as we
make out like fools in front of the flowers.
“Um, pardon us.” Someone clears their throat.
I pull away, but not before placing one last kiss on the tip of her nose,
loving the look on her face as she stares up at me.
“We just need to… Holy shit. Roly-Poly Rosie?”
Her entire body stiffens as she slowly turns in my arms, facing the
couple standing before us.
The guy is blond, his hair perfectly coifed with too much product. The
woman hanging on his arm is tall—taller than him even—and lean with
blonde hair that matches the shade of his. They're both dressed up, I'm
assuming on their way somewhere for dinner, and she's looking back and
forth between him and Rosie.
“Levi?” she says softly. I hate the way the name rolls off her tongue.
It's…familiar, and it makes my stomach hurt.
“Roly-Poly, wow! I almost didn't recognize you.” Before I realize what
the guy is doing, he wraps his arms around my girlfriend and says, “You
look great with that extra weight.”
He pats her stomach, and I see red because What in the actual fuck?
I take a step toward him, ready to pummel this fucking guy, but before I
can, the woman he's with steps between us. My momma would kick my ass
if I laid a hand on a woman, so I step back, squeezing my fists so I don't
forget my manners and deck the fucker anyway.
“Hi,” she says, holding her hand out. “I'm Kitty. It's great to meet you.”
Her smile is genuine, as if she's completely unbothered by what the twat
she's with just said.
“Hi,” Rosie says, shaking the outstretched hand. “We've actually met
before.”
“Oh?” Kitty shrugs. “I don't remember. Sorry.”
“It's fine.” Rosie waves her off, but I know her, and it's anything but
fine. She's hurt by the words, but she's trying not to show it. “So, Levi,
how's England treating you?”
“England? That's so last year,” the douchebag says. “We're back in the
States. We live here, actually.”
“Here?” The word comes out a squeak. Rosie clears her throat. “Since
when?”
“A few months now. Kitty got a job at some law firm.”
“Partner, babe. I'm a partner at the firm.”
“Yeah, partner, whatever.” Levi shrugs. “How are you? I haven't seen
you since… Gosh, how long has it been now?”
“Two and a half years,” Rosie answers, and I hate that she knows
exactly how long it's been. “Since you left.”
“Really? Time flies. Are you still doing that baking thing?” The asshole
looks over at me for the first time. “Hey, man. I'm Levi Kane. Rosie and I
go way back.”
He holds his hand out, and I want nothing fucking more than to smack it
away, but I have a feeling that won't go over so well with anyone. So, I do
the mature thing, and I grip his hand…tight. Like so fucking tight his hand
turns white under mine.
“Ivan Fitzgerald.”
His eyes narrow on me, and I don't miss the way he stretches his fingers
out when I finally release my grip. “Fitzgerald, huh? Why does that sound
familiar?”
“He plays for the Carolina Comets,” Rosie explains, and I love the pride
in her voice.
“No shit? Think you could hook us up with some tickets to a game?”
Is this guy fucking serious?
“I don't really care for hockey,” Kitty says, turning her nose up. “It's
entirely too violent.”
She has no clue how violent I want to be right now, and I'm not even on
the ice.
“That's fine. I can go with Brady.” He turns to Rosie. “You remember
him, right? From high school? You guys dated for a while.”
That rigidness is back in her shoulders, and I hate it just as much as
before.
“I remember him sleeping with everyone else after taking my virginity,
yes.”
Holy fuck. I remember her telling me about that guy. Well, not me me,
but ShootsAndScores me.
This guy is hanging out with him? What a fucking tool.
Levi laughs at Rosie's response, clearly not giving a shit about the hurt
in her voice, and says, “Yeah, but that was so long ago. No hard feelings
anymore. You're over it.”
I grit my teeth. There are definitely hard feelings there, and I hate that
he's telling her to feel otherwise.
In fact, I just straight-up hate this guy. I don't know him, but I don't
want to.
“Babe…” Kitty tugs on his arm. “We should really get going.”
“Can't you see I'm talking with an old friend?” He rolls his eyes at her,
then sends me a lopsided smile. “Women, right?”
My hands tingle with the urge to acquaint this fucker with my fist.
“Actually, we need to get going too,” Rosie says. “Our dinner starts
soon, and we don't want to be late.”
“Yeah, I bet you're excited to get there and eat.”
He pointedly looks at her stomach, and it's the last fucking straw. I step
toward him, fists ready to fly, but I'm stopped once more.
This time, it's Rosie. She tugs on my jacket, and I glance down at her.
She gives me a subtle headshake, and it takes everything in me to step back.
“We should get together sometime,” Levi says, not at all picking up on
the tension. “Maybe a double date or something.”
“Yeah, sure,” Rosie agrees, and I pray she's just saying it to pacify him.
There is no way in hell I'll go anywhere with this guy—except maybe out
to the alley so I can kill him and leave his body there all beaten and
mangled.
I should be concerned with how satisfying that image is, but I'm not.
This guy deserves it and so much more.
“It was great to meet you,” the girlfriend says.
“Again, we've met before,” Rosie tells her.
Kitty pouts. “I still don't remember.” She shrugs, then reaches into the
cooler and grabs a bouquet of roses. “These will do.”
“Let me know about those tickets, Ivan. See ya later, Roly-Poly.” Levi
winks at her, and I want to grab a rusty spoon and scoop his eyes out. “Call
me sometime.”
Over my dead fucking body.
I watch the fucker until he disappears around the corner, then turn back
to Rosie.
She's not looking at me. Her focus is solely on the cooler of flowers, but
she doesn't have to be looking my way for me to know she's upset. That
fucker got to her. I can see it in her body language, in the set of her
shoulders and the tightness in her jaw.
She's hurt, and it makes me hurt, and makes me want to hurt Levi. I
move to go find him, because there's no way I can possibly let him just
walk away after that shit.
“I think daisies,” Rosie says quietly, stopping me in my tracks. “What
do you think?”
I hate the way she's looking up at me, with trepidation in her gaze, like
she needs my approval. It's not her, not the woman I know—not the woman
I love.
I can't answer her. I don't have it in me to tell her what to do. It's not
my style. All I can do is reach around her and pick up the bouquet of
daisies.
“Come on.” I press a kiss to her cheek. “We don't want to be late.”
We don't speak for the entire drive.

ROSIE
Everything changed.
It's all messed up, and it's all Levi's fault. Running into my ex-best
friend, the one I was once in love with, has me completely topsy-turvy.
Nothing feels right, not the clothes I'm wearing or the food I'm eating or
even sitting next to Fitz. Something is broken…and I think it might be me.
“Holy crap, Rosie. This pie is incredible.” Scout moans as she stuffs
another bite into her mouth. “Like, I could kiss you this is so good.”
I force a smile her way, then say, “I'd let you,” because that's what the
Rosie they know would say.
The problem is, right now, I don't feel like that Rosie. I feel like the me
of two years ago all over again, and I hate it.
Scout giggles, then digs into the slice of pie once more.
There are about twenty-five people crowded around three long tables
that have been shoved together. It's easily the biggest Thanksgiving I've
been part of. With just me and my parents, who were both only children too,
we didn't have big holiday gatherings.
It's been chaotic between all the couples and kids running around.
Macie is having a blast being spoiled by everyone, Freddie is basically
being passed around the entire table, and Miller is setting up his karaoke
machine.
Well, he's attempting to. He and Rhodes are currently fighting over it.
“No. Absolutely not. I didn't want you people here anyway. I have to
draw the line somewhere,” the grumpy defenseman says, his brows drawn
tightly together, his hands slashing through the air with every word.
“Aw, come on. You don't mean that. You looooove us, especially me.”
“I don't love anyone, especially not you.”
“Hey!” Ryan yells at her husband, whose cheeks flame instantly.
“Except you. I love you. So fucking much.” He glares over at Miller.
“Maybe a little less right now, but still, so much.”
Ryan grins, satisfied with his answer.
“Miller, do you have ‘Monster Mash'? I'll totally sing that,” Harper
volunteers, rising from the table.
“Jesus.” Collin shakes his head but stares after his wife with a dopey
grin on his face.
“Or Queen! I'll do some Queen!” Hollis says, joining her sister.
“Please don't let her sing.” Lowell covers baby Freddie's ears. “She's a
horrible singer and I don't want to subject our daughter to this.”
“I heard that!”
“Shit,” Lowell mutters. “I forgot about the new-mom super-hearing.”
I tuck my lips together, trying not to laugh. It all feels so…normal, and I
love every second of it.
Well, I would love every second of it if I wasn't so damn scared to look
over at Fitz. We didn't speak the entire way here, and I hated every minute
sitting in that old truck. It wasn't his fault it was awkward with us. It was all
me. I didn't want to face him after what happened with Levi. I was
embarrassed about the way I let him talk to me, especially in front of Fitz.
I swore—swore—I would never be that person again, but the second I
saw my ex-best friend, I slipped right back into the old Rosie, the one with
no spine, the one who let everyone walk all over her and never stood up for
herself. I hated it in that moment, and I hate it now because I still feel like
that old version of myself, and I don't know how to shake it.
“Are you finished?” Emilia asks, pointing to my still full plate. I've
picked at a few things, but my appetite was completely gone after the
grocery store.
“Yes, but I got this,” I tell her, grabbing my plate and rising from the
table. “In fact, hand me those plates too.”
She tips her head. “Are you sure?”
“Of course. I could use a little break.” I gesture toward the room where
Harper and Hollis are currently sharing a microphone and belting out
Shania Twain's “Man! I Feel Like a Woman!” at full volume while Miller
has his own and is singing every word right along with them. It's easily the
most obnoxious and endearing thing I've ever witnessed.
Emilia laughs. “This group is so exhausting sometimes.”
“You're telling me.” I roll my eyes playfully.
I grab the plate from her hands, then retrieve a few more as I make my
way to the kitchen. I set them on the counter next to the others, then get to
work on filling the sink with water and soap. I know they have a
dishwasher, but I welcome the distraction.
I feel terrible because this is my first time being invited to something
like this with all these incredible people, and I'm in a terrible mood. And to
think I woke up this morning to Fitz's head between my legs, feeling like I
was walking on air. Then it all came crashing down around me thanks to
one little trip to the grocery store.
Maybe Fitz was right. Maybe we should have skipped the flowers.
I have no clue how long I stand at the sink scrubbing dishes before I
realize I'm not alone. I feel the moment he walks into the room. There's a
charge in the air and goose bumps pop up on my arms.
“I'll dry,” he says, stepping up next to me.
We work in silence for several seconds, and each one that passes grows
heavier and heavier. It's unbearable and I hate it. It's never been like this
with us before, and I don't want it to be like this now.
I'm just about to say something when Fitz breaks the silence.
“So, that guy…”
“Levi,” I provide.
“Yeah, that's one name for him,” he mutters. “He was your best friend,
wasn't he?”
I can hear the contempt in his voice. He doesn't like Levi, and I can
understand why, but he doesn't know Levi like I do. He wasn't always
awful. A lot of times, he was nice. He was always there when I needed him
most, and he had my back when I moved out of my parents' place. He was
mine.
“Yes, that was him.”
“The same one who made you feel like shit about your body?”
I can't confirm that one out loud. It sounds so bad when he says it like
that.
Don't get me wrong, I hate the way Levi makes me feel about myself,
but what I hate even more is the judgmental tone in Fitz's voice, because
it's not directed toward Levi.
It's directed toward me.
“He's a prick, Ro. You know that, right?”
My hands close tightly around the plate I'm holding, and I grind my
teeth together. “Yeah, I'm aware.”
“Are you? Because you just stood there and let him treat you like shit in
front of everyone.”
I drop the plate, not caring about the water that sloshes everywhere. I
turn to him, crossing my arms over my chest. “You don't think I know he's
awful, Fitz? I'm not stupid. I'm more than aware of the jabs he took at me.
If you really think it would have helped anything or anyone for me to say
something, you're wrong. It would have done nothing but make the
situation worse and more awkward than it already was.”
“Then you should have let me say something.” He lets the towel he's
holding drop to the counter. “Do you have any idea what that was like for
me? Just standing there and letting some asswipe say those things about
you?”
“Really?” I scoff, shaking my head. “You're worried about how you
felt? Did you ever stop to think I was humiliated to hear him say those
things in front of you? In front of the man I'm…I'm sleeping with.”
Both of his brows shoot up. “The man you're sleeping with?” Now it's
him who's shaking his head. “Is that what this is? Just sex?”
“What? No! Of course not.”
“Then why didn't you let me say something to him? I wanted to punch
that fucker. Hell, I still want to punch him. Why didn't you—”
“Because it's not your business!” I shout over him, well aware that
we're not the only people in the house and there's no way we're not
drawing everyone's attention.
Right now, I don't care.
“It's not your business, Fitz. It's mine.”
“You're my business, Rosie. Don't you get that? I'm all in over here.
Completely.”
“Yes, you're so in that you lied to me for weeks and pretended to be
someone else—that's how all in you are?”
He looks like I've punched him in the gut.
It's unfair. I know it's unfair.
I forgave him for that and we're beyond it, but right now, it's the only
ammo I have. I don't want to have this conversation about Levi, but he's
insisting on it, so I'm using everything I have in my arsenal.
“You're right,” he says quietly. “I did that. I did that, and I fucking
regret it. I wish I'd had the balls to approach you as me, but I didn't because
I'm not brave like you. I'm not strong like you are. I'm not—”
“Did you ever stop to think I'm not brave? Did you ever stop to think
maybe this is all a front and I'm just a shy, sheltered girl who doesn't know
who she is? Did that ever occur to you?”
“No,” he says matter-of-factly. “It didn't because I know you. That's not
you.”
“No, you know the me I want you to know. You don't know me like he
does.”
“So, what, then? All this”—he waves his hand over me—“it's all just a
big façade? You're a fake?”
I shrug. “Maybe. Maybe not.”
“No.” He shakes his head, then takes a step toward me. “No. I refuse to
believe that. That's not you. That's not—”
“Stop telling me who I am!”
He pauses, both his face and his shoulders falling.
I hate it. I hate it so much that I want to just run. I want to put as much
distance between us as possible because I cannot stand to look at him like
this.
“I'm sorry,” he says. “I didn't mean to—”
“That's the thing, Fitz. You never mean to. You didn't mean to lie to me
and lead me on. You didn't mean to watch my streams. You didn't mean to
ditch me at Slapshots, but you did. You did all those things and they
sucked.”
He reaches for me, and I back up.
“Stop. Please.”
“Okay.” He holds his hands up and takes a few steps away. “Okay. I…
Fuck.” He pinches the bridge of his nose, then looks up at me. “Are you
still in love with him?”
“Are you serious?” I counter, completely taken aback by his question.
The fact that he even has to ask me that…it sucks.
“Yes, I'm serious.”
I narrow my eyes. “I think you should go.”
He opens his mouth like he's going to argue, but then he thinks better of
it. “Okay.”
We stand there in silence for I don't even know how long. I stare at the
floor, and he stares at me. I know because I can feel it. I know what his eyes
feel like on me. I've had them there plenty. Hell, I've craved them before.
But right now…right now, I want anything other than this. I don't want
us when I feel like I don't know who I am.
“We…” He clears his throat. “We rode together. Do you want a ride?”
I shake my head, still not looking at him. “I'll get one from someone
else.”
“Fine.” It's all he says before he walks past me.
I burn to reach out to him. To touch him. To tell him to ignore me and
I'm just in a weird headspace. To beg him to stay.
But I don't do any of that. Instead, I just let him walk by. He reaches for
the door that leads out the back of the house and pauses with his hand on
the knob.
“You know,” he says in a low voice, “I think you might be right.”
I lift my head, meeting his gaze. I swallow when I see the pain swirl in
his hazel eyes because I know I'm the one causing all that hurt.
But can't he see that I'm in pain too? Reeling in a way I never thought I
would?
I want him to comfort me, not accuse me of still being in love with
Levi.
“I don't think I know you. Not right now. Because right now, this isn't
the Rosie I know, and it's not the Rosie I want to know either. If you find
her…if you find the woman I fell in love with, let me know.”
He walks out the door, taking my heart right along with him.

FITZ
I haven't spoken to Rosie in two days, and I feel like my insides are on my
outside. It's terrible, and if I never felt like this again, it would still be too
soon.
The worst part is, I can't do anything to fix this. It's all on her.
I meant it when I told her I'm all in because I am. I love her. I love her
more than anything or anyone in my life. I hope my mother never finds that
out, but it's true.
That said, until she figures out what she wants, I can't do anything
about it.
“You look like the shit my dog took on the floor this morning.”
He's probably right. We just beat Calgary 2–0. I should feel good,
should feel like I'm on cloud nine, but I don't. I feel like crap.
“When did you get a dog?” I ask Miller as he takes the spot beside me.
“I picked her up yesterday.” He pulls his phone out and flashes me a
picture. “I have no idea what she is, definitely a mix of pit bull and
something else, but isn't she gorgeous? I'm in love with her.” He slides the
phone back into his pocket. “I got her so Macie would like me best again.
She's so obsessed with you after you let her have a playdate with Carl, and I
refuse to be shown up by the likes of you.”
I flash him my teeth, pushing my tongue through the hole there. “I still
have this, you know, and she loves seeing how much of stuff I can fit in
there.”
He holds his arms out. “Punch me, then. Knock my tooth out. I'll fall
right on that grenade.”
I shake my head, grinning for the first time in days. “Shut up, Miller.”
“Aw, you're just saying that because you're worried. Don't worry, Fitzy
Baby, I'll always love you even if Macie doesn't.”
“Leave him alone, Miller,” Greer says from across the room.
The guy in question sighs, then rises to his feet. “Fine—but I'm only
going because I have to go meet Scout. We're going shopping for toys and
stuff for little Mooseknuckle.”
“You cannot name your dog Mooseknuckle.”
He scoffs. “Says the guy with the female cat named Carl.”
He shakes his head like I'm the crazy one, then walks out of the room.
I'd never tell him this, but I kind of miss him when he goes. He might just
be the best distraction there is, mostly because it's easy to laugh at him.
“How you holding up, man?”
I drag my eyes across the room, unsurprised to find a scowling Greer
looking my way. He shouldn't be scowling, not after that shutout win, but
of course he is. He always is. That's just who he is.
I sigh, then drop back into my cubby. I could lie to him. I could tell him
I'm fine and things will be fine, but I don't have it in me to lie.
“Not good, Greer. Not good at all.”
He nods. “I get it.”
“Do you? Your perfect girl is probably waiting for you to come home to
your perfect life with your perfect daughter-to-be. Mine is…” I trail off, not
willing to admit I have no clue what Rosie is doing. I wish I did, but I don't.
I want to reach out to her so badly it's hard to concentrate on anything else.
It's fucking weird living in this limbo.
Greer huffs out a laugh. “It's not perfect.”
“No? You're telling me you two aren't madly in love, then?”
“Well, yeah, we are, but we aren't perfect—not by a long shot.” He
sighs. “We bicker daily. I'm a grumpy asshole, and she's stubborn to her
core. Also, Macie can be annoying as hell sometimes because she's a kid
and kids are the worst.”
“I'm not sure you're allowed to say that now that you're dating a girl
with a kid.”
He shrugs, not caring. “Just being honest. Relationships aren't always
easy. In fact, they kind of blow sometimes. Even when things are amazing,
they don't stay that way. It's like hockey: it's just grinding and working
hard every day, hoping the result is what you want.”
I laugh sardonically. “Thanks for the relationship advice. It's just what I
wanted from a guy who only started believing in love this year.”
He narrows his eyes. “Well, maybe you'll like hearing it from a guy
who almost lost everything he loves by letting his emotions get the better of
him and nearly ruin everything.”
“If you think I'm the one who did that, you're wrong. It wasn't me. It
was her. She's the one who is all… I don't even know what she is.”
“And you think she does? Someone from her past—someone who broke
her heart once—just came back. She's probably going through some shit
you can't understand. Maybe she just needs space to figure things out.”
When I don't say anything, he goes back to knocking things around in
his cubby. It's several tense minutes before he looks my way again, giving
me a hard stare.
“What.” It's not really a question, mostly because I'm over questions
today. I just want him to say whatever the fuck he has to say, then leave me
alone to wallow.
“You know she doesn't love him, right?”
I nod. “I know that.”
That's the thing. I do know. I know she's over him. I know it's not him
she loves.
But I'm not so sure she loves herself either.
“Okay. Then you know she loves you, right?”
I don't say anything because I don't know that. I want to believe she
does, want to believe it so fucking badly, but it's hard to at the moment.
Greer sighs. “Just give her some time, man. Give her space. As much as
it sucks, she needs that more than she needs you.”
His words hit me right in the chest, the pain spreading throughout my
body.
Ah, hell. Who am I kidding? That pain has been there for days, and with
each minute that passes with me not knowing what Rosie is doing, it gets
worse.
“Look,” he says, grabbing his backpack and slinging it over his
shoulder. “You're going to be fine. Things with Rosie will work out. I know
they will.”
“How can you be so sure?”
“Are you kidding me?” He sweeps his arm out wide. “Look at this
damn team, man. We're dropping like flies, another one of us falling in love
every damn day—even me. I never in my life thought I would be here,
madly in love with a woman I sure as fuck don't deserve, but I am. Wright,
Rhodes, Lowell, Smith, and Miller are too. All those relationships turned
out fine, and if you let it, yours will too.”
He walks over to me and pats my shoulder twice, clearly uncomfortable
with comforting me. It would make me laugh if I didn't feel like such shit
right now.
“She'll come back to you. Just be patient.”
I nod. “Thanks, Greer.”
“Yeah, course. Any time.”
He gives me a sad smile before taking off, leaving me alone in the
locker room trying to figure out my life.
I'm glad he has faith it will all work out.
Me? I'm not so sure…and I'm not sure I'm ready to find out.
I've been sitting at my computer for the last hour staring at the black screen
in front of me. I've managed to power it on twice before shutting it off each
time.
Now, the blue light at the bottom of my monitor is taunting me, and it's
taking everything I have not to yank it from the wall and chuck it out the
window. I've been itching to see Rosie, and I know this is the only way I
can see her. Another two days have passed without hearing from her, and
we're now sitting at four days way too fucking many.
It's harder than I thought going without her. Sure, we haven't been
together that long, but she's been in my life daily for a year now. Suddenly
not seeing her…it feels wrong, like my entire universe has been flipped
around and I don't know which way is up or down. I went from a fourteengame point streak to nothing in back-to-back games, and I haven't had a
strawberry since I dug into the strawberry pie she made for Thanksgiving,
not even my usual after-game smoothie.
Everything is off and all wrong.
It's crazy how everything I thought was so boring about my life
suddenly didn't feel boring anymore with her by my side, how all the things
I didn't like about myself suddenly became my favorite things because they
were her favorite things. She made me feel like I belonged, like I was good
enough.
I fucking miss her, and I need to see her.
Even though I don't want to invade her privacy and want to respect her
space, logging into my old account feels like the only option to see her.
Besides, I just want to make sure she's okay, check in with her. There's no
harm in that, right?
Meow.
I look over just in time to see Carl strut into my office. She's been
avoiding me for the last few days too. Girls always stick together, right?
She makes her way across the room, surprising me when she rubs
against my leg.
“All right. Come on,” I tell her, bending down to pick her up.
Meow.
“I know.” I scratch under her chin just like she likes. “I miss her too.”
Meow.
“I wish I could see her.”
Carl hops out of my arms and onto my keyboard.
“Hey!” I try to shoo her away, but she ignores me like she always does.
“Get off there, you little shithead.”
Suddenly the fans of the computer spin to life and the monitor turns on.
Meow.
I grab Carl, tucking her back into my lap, then hovering my finger over
the sleep button on my keyboard.
Meow.
“Hush,” I tell her. “I'll lock you in the pantry again.” Though I'm sure
she would love that since I bought her a fresh loaf of bread this morning.
She'd be damn comfortable in there.
I go to click the button, but I'm stopped by the little paw that reaches
out, swatting at my hand.
“Carl, I swear to god, I'm going to—”
The words die on my lips when I look down.
I'm possessed again. I have to be. That's the only reason for the mouse
to be in my hand because I sure as hell don't remember grabbing it.
“Might as well,” I mumble.
I click on the internet icon, then navigate to the site I promised Rosie I'd
unsubscribe to. Technically, I did. I stopped following her account—but I
didn't delete mine. It's not because I plan on using it again to watch other
women, but just in case she and I ever want to experiment.
I log in, then hold my breath as I type in her username with one hand
and hit go on the search bar.
This user cannot be found.
“What the…” I sit forward, reading the message again.
Nope. It still says the same thing.
“Maybe I typed it in wrong.”
I hit backspace several times, then type it again: R-O-P-L-A-Y-I-N-G. I
hit go and the page refreshes.
This user cannot be found.
It's wrong. It has to be. There's no way she can't be found unless…
“She deleted her account.”
Meow.
I'm pretty sure Carl's latest vocalization translates to, No shit, idiot.
Now give me a treat.
But why? Why did Rosie delete her account? And what does it mean? Is
she done streaming? Is she done with…me?
Emotion claws at my throat with that thought. I don't want her to be
done with me. I want her to figure out what she wants and I want her to
want me, but more than that, I want Rosie to be happy. If that means she
doesn't stream and she goes back to whoever she was before and tells me to
get lost, I guess that's okay with me too.
But really…really, I hope she chooses me, because I damn sure choose
her, and I'll choose her every day for the rest of my life if she'll let me.
I just need her to believe that too.

ROSIE
For the second time in as many months, I didn't show up to work. This
time, I ditched for an entire week.
I have no clue how, but I still have a job. Either Scout is way cooler
than I've ever given her credit for, or she's really that hard up for a decent
baker.
When I finally drag myself into the donut truck a few days after
Thanksgiving, I walk right into chaos.
“Oh, hey!” Stevie says from her position on the floor. “Watch where
you step. I dropped some sprinkles, and that damn replacement cold brew
pitcher snapped on me.” She shakes her head. “What are the odds, right?”
Pretty slim, but I'm not surprised things are all screwed up. That seems
to be the theme in my life nowadays. When I went to get dressed this
morning—the first time I changed out of my pajamas in days—I discovered
a hole in the thigh of my favorite jeans, and when I went to put my hair up
in my usual messy bun, my ponytail holder broke in half.
Everything is messed up.
“Do you need to run and grab some supplies?”
“No need,” a voice says from behind me.
I turn to find Scout walking into the truck, two bags in each hand.
They're filled with everything we'll need to get us through the day.
“Rosie, glad you could make it in.” She raises a pointed brow.
I grimace, guilt eating at me instantly. “Hi.”
“Here.” She shoves a fresh container of sprinkles at me. “Refill these,
then get to work on icing the strawberry donuts.”
Just hearing the word strawberry has my stomach dropping to the floor.
Oh, look—there it is right next to Stevie as she continues scrubbing up the
mess.
“On it, boss.” I drop my head as I shuffle past her. I wash my hands,
then pull on my gloves and get started on my tasks. The three of us work
quietly for the next few hours as we open the truck and work through the
line that's stretched to the parking lot.
Finally, at ten, we get a break. Scout sets the Be Right Back sign on the
front counter, then spins in my direction.
“We need to talk.” Her voice is terse, and it immediately sets me on
edge.
Here it comes. I'm getting fired.
“Grab a drink and meet me out front.”
I nod and take all the time in the world pouring myself a fresh cold
brew. I should really opt for water since I don't remember the last time I
had any, but if I'm getting fired, I'm going down with one last delicious
drink in my hand, not water.
When I exit the truck, that sour feeling in my stomach worsens when I
see Scout and Stevie sitting at the picnic table, each with a frown on her
lips.
Yeah, I'm totally screwed.
I suck in a deep breath and shove my shoulders back, holding my head
up high as I make my way over. I settle onto the bench across from them
and fold my hands around my cup, holding on to it like an anchor.
“Before you say anything, I just wanted to tell you what an honor it's
been working here. I appreciate this opportunity you've given me, and it
has meant more to me than you'll ever know. The friends I've made…the
people I've met…” I swallow back the lump in my throat because people
includes him. “I'm grateful. So damn grateful. I'm sorry I've let you down,
and I completely understand why we're having this meeting.”
Scout and Stevie look over at one another with furrowed brows for
several seconds before turning back to me.
“Do you?” Scout asks. “Do you understand why we're having this
meeting?”
“Well, yeah. I'm getting fired.”
Stevie's brows shoot up. “Is that what you think?”
“Yes?” It comes out as a question because I have no clue what's going
on. “Am I not?”
“Um, no. We love you. We'd never fire you.”
“But I…I ditched work for the last week. Aren't you mad about that?”
Scout shrugs. “Sometimes the things happening in our lives are more
important than someone getting their donut fix in the morning.”
Is she serious? I'm not fired?
“We actually wanted to talk to you about something we heard.”
Now my stomach sinks for a whole different reason, because the only
thing this could be about is…
“You want to open your own bakery.”
I physically lean back because What?
“How did you hear about that?” I ask.
“Macie.”
Oh god. When she was over at Fitz's meeting Carl, we talked about me
opening my own bakery. I should have known she would say something to
her mom.
“Oh. That.”
“Yeah, that.” Scout stretches a hand across the table and grabs mine, the
one that's currently fiddling with the straw in my cup. She stills my panic
fidgeting and gives my hand a squeeze. “Why didn't you tell us?”
I lift a shoulder. “I…I don't know. I was scared, I guess. You two have
done so much for me and given me such an amazing opportunity… It just
felt like I was throwing all that back in your face by wanting to start my
own place.”
Scout shakes her head. “No. Not even close. Rosie…” She sighs.
“You're an incredible baker. Way better than me. This place, as much as I
love it—it's not enough for you, and that's okay. I knew that after the first
week I hired you. I knew you wouldn't stay forever, and I never expected
you to. I want to see you flourish. I want to see you grow. And more than
that, I want to be the first damn customer in whatever shop you open.”
I blink back the tears stinging my eyes because I wasn't expecting that
at all. “You do? You'd come to my bakery?”
“Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I? I mean, you don't get an ass that don't
quit like mine by not eating delicious sweets.”
I laugh. It feels so foreign after not doing it for days, but it's good. So
good.
“And if you think for one second I won't be coming to get some of
those delicious peanut butter caramel cookies you sent home with Greer and
Macie, you're nuts. Those were easily the most amazing thing I've ever
tasted. Greer got jealous of them because I kept moaning every time I ate
one and he was very threatened by it.”
“Why can I totally see that from him?”
Stevie shrugs. “Because it's such a Greer thing to do. He's annoying
like that.” She might roll her eyes, but the smile on her face says she finds it
anything but annoying.
And just like that, all the laughter inside me dies because I had
something like that before, but now…now I'm scared it's gone.
“Uh-oh.” Scout squeezes my hand again. “Have you still not talked to
Fitz?”
Just hearing his name has my heart hammering in my chest like I've just
run a marathon. God, I miss him so much. I want to talk to him so badly,
but I don't know where to start. I don't know how to explain what I'm
feeling because I still don't know what I'm feeling.
I shake my head. “No. I don't know what to say.”
“I mean, telling him you love him is usually a good start,” she suggests.
I don't even bother trying to deny it because I do love Fitz. So damn
much. That's one thing I'm absolutely certain of, and that's not my problem
at all.
My problem is me.
I don't feel like I know who I am anymore, and I'm honestly not even
sure I ever did. One run-in with Levi and I slipped right back into
everything I promised I'd never be again. All it did was show me that even
though I try so hard to act tough and badass, I'm still just a scared little girl
who is afraid to stand up for herself. As much as I tried, I don't think I ever
got rid of the old me, not with so many old wounds left open and unhealed.
“You do love him, right?” Scout asks.
“Yes. I love Fitz. Like I'm madly in love with him and am going mildly
crazy without him kind of love him.”
“Then…what's the problem?”
“Me,” I reply honestly.
She gives me a sad smile. “I know how you feel.”
“You do?”
She nods. “Yeah. I kind of went through the same thing with Miller. It
was never that I didn't love him, but I didn't love me. I didn't know who I
was anymore. I'd been trying so hard and throwing myself into my work
and everything else that I lost who I was somewhere along the way. Being
with Miller woke me up to the fact that I was missing something, and it
wasn't just him. I was missing me. Is that how you're feeling?”
“Yes. Yes, that's exactly it.” I run my tongue over my drying lips.
“That's how I feel. I've tried so hard over the last few years to make myself
feel good and, honestly, I thought I was doing fine. With my photos and my
streaming and going to school…those are all things I wanted to do, and all
those things made me feel good. But now…now I don't know. Did I just do
them because they were the exact opposite of what I was told to do, or did I
do them because I really wanted to, you know?”
Neither of them says anything, and that's fine. I'm not sure I want them
to say anything. I'm not sure what answer I'm looking for. Maybe I just
need to vent a bit.
“Can I ask you something?” Stevie says after a few minutes of silence.
“I've just spilled my guts to you, so I guess.”
“Why do you stream?”
“Excuse me?”
“Your streams, your late-night activities—why do you do it? I mean,
don't get me wrong, I think you're badass for it, but why?”
“I…”
All my usual reasons are right there on the tip of my tongue, but for the
first time, they don't feel right.
“I don't know,” I say honestly. “I think maybe because I liked feeling
seen. I liked feeling wanted. I liked feeling…free. And yes, it made me feel
good—sexy. It made me feel like I was a bad bitch with a banging body
people actually wanted to look at, and it certainly opened up a whole new
side of me sexually. But more than that, it made me feel seen.”
“How does Fitz make you feel?”
“Seen.”
The answer is automatic like it's been right there in front of me the
entire time. Fitz makes me feel seen, and I don't just mean because he
enjoys watching me.
It's more than that. He listens to me. He values my opinion. He asks me
questions about myself. He encourages me to make my own decisions. He
makes me feel like an actual human and not just a missing piece of
whatever puzzle he's trying to put together.
That's how my parents made me feel—like an obligation, something
they had to do, which is probably why they had my whole life mapped out
for me when I was still in the womb.
Then with Levi, it was the same way. He was the one who planted the
seed of me moving out of my parents' place and ditching their college plans
for me. He was the one who told me who was good enough for me, who
told me what I liked and what I didn't. He was the one who kept me
tethered to him just enough that I felt like we had an actual chance of being
together when I was always just a backup plan for him.
Then he left, and for the first time in a long time, I was alone. So, I
threw myself into anything and everything I could to make myself feel
desired again. I changed my clothes, my hair, and hell, my entire attitude
because it was what I thought everyone else wanted.
But it wasn't, and I don't even know if it's what I really wanted.
Maybe…maybe this whole time, what I needed was to give myself
permission to love…well, myself.
“How did you fix it?” I ask Scout. “Because this is awful. I want to be
with him so badly, but I also want…”
“To fix what's broken, and you know you can't fix it by burying
yourself in him?”
I nod. “Exactly.”
“As much as it sucks to hear…time. I took time for myself, and I
figured out what I wanted. I figured out who I was. After I did what I
needed, I went to him, and the rest worked itself out.”
She says it like it's the easiest thing in the world, and perhaps it is.
“For what it's worth,” Stevie says, “I think you're a lot closer to that
than you give yourself credit for. I think maybe this thing with your ex-best
friend coming back into your life has you all messed up. Maybe that's a
chapter you need to end properly before you can move on to the next.”
“Hey!” Scout scowls at her sister. “I'm the author—book metaphors are
my thing.” She looks over at me. “But Stevie has a point. Talking with him
might be a good place to start.”
As much as I don't want to talk to Levi, they might be right.
“Thank you—both of you. I have no idea what I'd do without you in my
life. You're kind of my best friends.”
“Then next time, maybe tell your best friends you're thinking of
ditching them for your own bakery?” Scout narrows her eyes but squeezes
my hand to let me know she's only teasing.
I chuckle. “I will. Besides, it's not something that will happen for
several years still. I have plenty of time left here to drive you crazy.”
“And we wouldn't change that for anything.” Stevie reaches across the
table, grabs my other hand, and squeezes it. “Now, as much as we love you
and want you here, you look like you haven't slept in days, so…”
“Go home and get proper rest?”
“Please. I don't need you scaring away all my customers. I need all the
regulars I can get before my competition heats up.” Scout winks at me.
“And I'm heading out too. I have to take Mooseknuckle to the vet.”
“Who is Mooseknuckle?”
“Oh! Our new dog.” She pulls up her phone and shows me a picture of
an adorable little gray puppy. “I let Miller name her.”
I lift a brow. “You don't say.”
I look over at Stevie, who is rolling her eyes at her sister.
She rises from the bench with a shrug. “Love does crazy things to you.”
And don't I know it.
“So, what are you going to do?” Stevie asks as Scout heads for the
truck.
“I think…” I sigh. “I think I need to have a talk with my former best
friend.”
“Roly-Poly Rosie!” I hear from across the room.
I turn in my chair to find Levi strutting into Cup of Joe's coffee shop
like he owns the place. When he reaches the table, he tries to give me a hug,
but I thwart his advances, moving away from his outstretched arms.
“Aw, come on, Roly.” He laughs it off, taking the seat across from me.
“You know you missed me.”
The sad thing is, he's right. A small part of me did miss Levi. I missed
all the fun we used to have as kids. All the mud pies we made, all the times
we hung out in his treehouse, him tossing that damn football against the
wall and me reading a romance novel I'd snuck from his mom's stash. I
missed his parents, and I missed the way he used to make me laugh.
But even though I missed all that, there's so much more that I didn't
miss at all. Honestly, it makes me wonder what the hell I was thinking when
I thought I was in love with him.
“So, Roly, how ya been? I can't believe it's been so many years. How
are things?” He looks down at the plate in front of me, which is empty save
for a few crumbs from my caramel apple pie. “I see you're as big a fan of
sweets as ever. Scarfed that one down, huh?”
He laughs, but there's nothing funny about what he just said.
“I didn't really come here for pleasantries, Levi.”
His thick brows inch closer together. “Then what did you want to meet
for?”
“Honestly? I want to tell you I don't love you, and I never did.”
“Um…okay? I—”
“No.” I sit forward. “I'm going to do the talking here, understood?”
He sits up straight. His eyes are wide, and he nods once.
“Once upon a time, I thought you hung the moon and I was madly in
love with you. You were my best friend, and you were a good guy—or so I
thought. Now that I've had distance and time away from you, I realize how
wrong I was about all of it. You didn't hang the moon, and I never loved
you. If I had, I wouldn't have let you talk to me the way you do. I wouldn't
have let you treat me like you always have, like I'm this poor helpless girl
who needs you to tell her what to do. I wouldn't have let you talk down to
me or let you tell me I'm fat.” I scoff. “Between you and my parents, it's a
wonder I ever got away from any of it. I was so okay with all of you
running my life, telling me what to do, but I never stopped to think about
what I wanted.
“So, over the last two years, I did what I wanted. I built a version of
myself that I like. I did boudoir shots. I took sexy photos of myself. I wore
clothes that fit me. I met people who made me laugh and accepted every
part of me. I learned I'm a damn good baker and friend. And more than all
that, I learned that I'm worthy of being respected. I'm worth more than all
those expectations and opinions other people—people like you—shoved
onto me. I'm beautiful just the way I am. I'm smart, I'm capable, and I'm
fucking worthy of being loved for just being me. I don't need to bend or
fold to meet anyone else's standards, least of all yours. The only person I
ever needed permission from was myself, and right now, I give myself
permission to tell you I don't want you in my life, and you have no hold
over me anymore.”
I sit back when I'm finished with my speech, feeling the weight I've
been carrying around for far too long fall off my shoulders brick by brick.
For the first time in a long time, I feel free.
Levi just stares at me.
Then stares some more.
Finally, after several minutes of us sitting in silence, he speaks.
“You know, when I ran into you on Thanksgiving, I thought to myself,
There's no way that's the same Rosie I've always known. And it turns out, I
was right. You're not that same person. You're a lot stronger than you used
to be, and frankly, I'm proud of you.”
“I don't need you to be proud of me.”
He gives me that same dimpled smile I used to love, but this time, it
doesn't have the same effect. “I know.”
And he sounds…resigned, sounds okay, like he's fine with me telling
him off.
“I don't think we would have made a good match.” His voice is low and
sad and nothing like I've ever heard from him before. “And you're right, I
did treat you like shit. I did keep you around as a second choice. You didn't
deserve that. You deserve someone who looks at you like you hung the
moon—like that guy at the grocery store did. He's more than I could ever
be to you. I might not have acted like it, but leaving you behind sucked. I
can see now that was probably the best thing to ever happen to you.”
“It was,” I agree. “I know that now.”
He gives me a small smile. “Good. I'm glad.” He lets out a sigh, then
pushes his chair back. “I think it's best if I go.”
“Yeah, probably.”
He stands and peers down at me. “You know, you'll always be my RolyPoly Rosie, and I'll miss all the good times we had. And…I'm sorry. Truly.”
With that, he tucks his hands into his pockets and exits the coffee shop
and my life for the last time.
I've never felt better.

FITZ
I've been checking MyFans daily, hoping for a glimpse of Rosie, but her
account is still deleted. There's a part of me that's glad she's not sharing
herself with other people when she can't even share herself with me, but
fuck do I miss her.
I haven't seen her in two weeks now. I've gone to Scout's Sweets a few
times, but only when I have an advance warning that she isn't going to be
there. It's not because I don't want to see her, but because I'm trying to
respect her need to be alone.
If I'm being honest, it's getting harder and harder every day not to just
show up at her apartment and demand she talk to me, but every day, I do it.
I stay away, and I'll keep staying away until she's ready. The last thing I
want to do is pressure her or tell her what she needs to do. She's had enough
of that in her life, and she doesn't need it from me.
Besides, I trust Rosie. I trust that, eventually, she'll find her way back to
me, and I'm willing to wait as long as that takes.
“All right, boys.”
Coach Heller claps twice to get our attention. We're facing an uphill
battle in the third period for the I don't even know how many-eth time this
season. We're getting entirely too comfortable giving up early goals, then
forcing our way out of a hole. We need to fix our shit before we run
ourselves into the ground one too many times and blow any chance we have
at the Cup.
“We've been in this position before—too many damn times if you ask
me, but that means we have proof that we can do this. Get the pucks in
deep, go hard to the net, and win this fucking hockey game.”
Everyone claps twice, then Coach leaves.
“Coach is right,” Lowell chimes in. “We got this. It's not ideal, but we
know we can do this. Rhodes, watch your edges. Wright, win those board
battles. Miller, Hayes, Fitzy, let's get to the front of the net, screen the
goalie a bit more.”
“And shoot blocker side,” Greer adds. “He's having a hard time on that
side tonight. For fuck's sake, give me some good defense out there, will
ya?”
We'd all laugh if it wasn't so true.
We have three minutes before we need to be on the ice, so I bend down
and pull my skates back on, getting ready to head back out there and give it
my fucking all.
“Hey.” Rhodes digs his elbow into my side. “Dude, look.”
I look up at where he's pointing. There's a TV in the corner of the room,
and I'm shocked by what I see on the screen. The Zamboni is still out there
giving the ice a clean, but that's not what draws my attention.
No, it's the person sitting on the Zamboni.
“Rosie.”
“What's she doing?” Rhodes asks. “And what's that sign she's
holding?”
I lean closer to get a better look.
Hey, #91, I'll trade you a kiss for a strawberry donut.
“I'm pretty sure that's for you,” Wright comments.
“Aw, I think she likes you, man.” Miller smacks my shoulder a few
times.
“What the fuck is she wearing?” Ford asks.
“If that was my girl out there, there's no way I'd be standing around in a
locker room with a bunch of smelly fuckers. I'd be running out there to
claim my kiss.”
Greer's words snap me out of my stupor, and before I know it, I'm
racing out and straight down the tunnel to the ice. I don't have all my gear
on, and my skates aren't laced up properly. Damn, I'm not even wearing a
shirt, but I don't give a shit.
I need to see Rosie, and I need to see her now.
I stop just short of my skates hitting the ice. She's on the other side, still
holding that damn sign. I cup my hands around my mouth and yell out for
her.
“Ro!”
She turns my way instantly, and the biggest grin I've ever seen from her
spreads across her lips.
“Fitz!”
Then she's tugging at the belt over her lap and jumping off the machine.
“Hey! Ma'am! Ma'am! You can't do that!” the driver yells, but she
doesn't care, and fuck, I don't either.
She slips and slides, nearly falling over too many times for my liking, so
I hit the ice, skating to meet her halfway, not even caring how much trouble
I'm going to get into for this. I don't have it in me to care. Not now, not
when she's so damn close.
I hear the chatter around the arena get louder and louder as they try to
figure out what's happening. A few loud whistles, a few cheers, and
distantly, I hear my name being called from behind me, but I ignore that
too.
I stride toward her, coming to a stop just a few feet away. I want to
reach out and touch her so badly, but this is all on her terms. I want her to
be the first to make a move.
“Rosie…”
“You know it's ridiculously cold out here? I mean, I kind of figured
since it's ice and all, but man, I really didn't think it would be this cold. And
good gravy, it's hard as hell to walk on ice. Not as bad as I thought, but still
difficult. You know, I really thought those two things would be flipped, that
it wouldn't be as cold as it is and that it'd be harder to walk, and I—”
“Ro.” I tilt my head to the side. “As much as I love your rambling, what
the hell are you doing? That's a big jump. Are you okay?”
She grins at me. “Isn't it obvious? I'm offering you a kiss for a donut.”
She ignores my worry, lifting her sign to show it to me. “I mean, I don't
have the donut with me, but I totally promise to get you one—that is, if you
kiss me, and I'm not even sure if that's something you want to do since I
haven't seen you in weeks, but just in case you do, I—”
I cut her off with a kiss because I know it's the only way to shut her up.
And okay, it's also because I really, really want to fucking kiss her.
Having her lips on mine…it's so much more than I remember. She tastes
like strawberries and heaven and everything I ever fucking wanted. She
tastes like mine, and there's no way in hell I'm ever going to let this woman
go.
When I finally pull away, she's as out of breath as I am, and it has
nothing to do with the short skate it took to get to her.
It's all Rosie.
“Hi,” I say, brushing my nose against hers.
“Hi.” She presses her mouth to mine again briefly.
“Looks like you owe me a strawberry donut.”
“I guess I do.”
I kiss her again because I can't help it.
This time, it's her who pulls away first.
“Fitz, I'm…god, I'm so sorry. I…I don't know what happened. Seeing
Levi again… It made me feel so many different things I wasn't expecting.
No!” She shakes her head. “No, not like that—not like you're thinking.”
I realize my face must be conveying everything I feel because hearing
her say Levi and feelings in the same sentence makes my stomach feel like I
swallowed lead.
“Do you remember when you asked me if I loved him?”
Of course I remember. She didn't answer, and at first, that killed me, but
I also knew there was no way she still loved him.
“I don't. I don't love him. Not at all, and I never did. I was just in love
with the idea of him, the fairy tale of falling in love with your next-door
neighbor, your best friend, that person who knows you better than anyone.
But him…” She shakes her head. “He doesn't know me. He never knew me.
Not like you do. He doesn't know what makes me tick. He doesn't know all
the things I like and all the things I hate. He has no clue who I am, and I
told him that. I met up with him and I told him off. You'd have been so
proud of me.”
I am proud of her. So fucking proud. And I'm about to tell her that, but
she keeps going.
“You know me, Ivan. Hell, you knew me before I even knew me. You
saw through every mask I ever wore. You see me. You've always seen me.”
She brings her hands to my face, cupping my cheeks in the same way I
always cup hers. “So, to answer your question, I don't love him. I love you,
Ivan. I've always loved you, and I always will love you. I just hope I'm not
too late in saying it.”
I don't say anything for several seconds, mostly because I'm not sure
what I should say.
She loves me? Rosie Calhoun is in love with me?
“Hey, idiot! Tell her you love her too! We got a fucking game to play!”
I look over my shoulder to find my entire team standing on the bench,
all staring at us. In fact, the entire sold-out arena is staring, including the
other team and a few people from security. I forgot about all of them
because all that matters in this moment is Rosie.
“Fitz?” she says softly. “Are you going to say anything? I mean, if you
don't love me anymore, that's okay. I just—”
For the second time tonight, I cut her words off with a kiss, and this
time, I do hear the cheers and shouts from the crowd.
When I pull away, she smiles. “I owe you two donuts now.”
“I always get two donuts.”
She sinks her teeth into her bottom lip, peering up at me with
trepidation. “Does this also mean…”
“That I love you? Yeah, Ro, I love you. I think I've been in love with
you for a long time now, since way before I ever found your channel.
Actually, I think I might have fallen the first time I went to the donut truck
and you made fun of me for getting strawberry donuts when there—”
“Are so many better options? I know. It's insane.”
“Then how come you always taste like strawberries if you don't like
them?”
A slow grin spreads across her lips, which I'm dying to kiss again.
“After I realized you like them so much, I perhaps started wearing
strawberry-flavored lip balm. You know, just in case.” She winks, and it
makes me laugh. “What? It totally worked.”
I kiss her again because fuck it. The game has already been paused
because we're standing on the ice way past what intermission is, so might
as well.
“Can I ask you something?” I say when I pull away.
“Anything.”
“Why'd you delete your MyFans account?”
Her eyes widen. “You looked for me?”
My cheeks heat. “Yeah. I…I missed you. I know you asked me not to
watch you anymore and I haven't, but then you were gone and…it was the
only way I could think to see you. Please don't be mad.”
“I'm not mad. I missed you too. And I didn't delete my account, just put
it on pause. I needed to figure out if I was doing it for the right reasons or
not.”
“And?”
“I was. I miss it. But I also think I'm going to be okay if I don't go back
to it. Turns out, there's this guy who makes me feel all the things I was
looking for by streaming.”
“Yeah? What's he like?”
“Well, for starters, he's pretty hot. He has this toothless smile that's just
so cute. He's kind and intelligent. He treats me with respect, and he lets me
do whatever makes me happy. And, between you and me, he's a little
naughty in the bedroom.”
I grin. “Cute and naughty, huh? He sounds pretty cool.”
She nods. “Oh yeah, he's definitely cool. And he does this thing with his
tongue that I really like, so I figure I'll keep him around.”
She waggles her brows, and I laugh.
“You're insane.”
“Maybe, but you like me.”
“No, Rosie. I love you.”
She sighs. “I love you, too, Ivan.”
And then, I kiss her again.
The Comets win the game, no thanks to me. I got benched, but I'm okay
with it, because I also got the girl.
EPILOGUE
Rosie
I became a headline.
That wasn't exactly my intention when I decided to win Fitz back, but it
happened.
WOMAN DRESSED AS DONUT INTERRUPTS COMETS AND
GETS BANNED FROM ARENA
I won't lie, I wasn't at all anticipating that repercussion when I decided to
jump off the Zamboni, but it was worth getting escorted off the ice by
security and told I wasn't allowed back for a year. Really, I'm lucky it was
that short. They wanted it to be for life, but Fitz talked them down. I think
he may have bribed them a bit, but he says I'm worth it.
I just wish I could have deferred my ban to a season when the Comets
didn't make it all the way to the Stanley Cup Final. Unfortunately, I missed
all the home games and had to watch them from Slapshots. All the wives
and other girlfriends stood in solidarity next to me and gave up their spots
to keep me company.
Now, at the tail end of Game Seven, we're all wearing our Playoff
jackets and seated in the suite we reserved because this is an away game,
and the boys are five minutes away from doing something they've worked
their entire lives for—winning the Stanley Cup. The score is tied, and all we
need to do is keep the puck out of our net and get another goal.
“Just five more minutes,” Harper says. “They just need to hold on for
five more minutes.”
Stevie has her hands on her cheeks, eyes locked on the ice. “I think I
might junk punch Greer if he lets another goal in.”
“He'll totally be the jackass again if they don't win.”
Stevie doesn't even have it in her to scold her daughter for her
comments. Besides, I think both reactions might be warranted.
After Fitz and I made up, the Comets went on one hell of a heater. They
were the first team to clinch a Playoff spot and even took home the
Presidents' Trophy. Now let's just hope that old superstition of winning the
Presidents' Trophy but not the Cup doesn't come back to bite them in the
ass.
“My panties are wet, and not even for a good reason. It's pure sweat at
this point,” Ryan says, watching as Rhodes slams a guy into the boards.
“Okay, now they're wet for a good reason.”
I laugh, then return my attention to the ice. Fitz has the puck, and he
passes it to Miller, who shoots it toward the net. Everyone gets out of their
seat as the puck rolls off his blade and misses the net by a foot.
Before anyone has a chance to sit back down, he has it back, and this
time, when he shoots, he doesn't miss. Everyone is jumping up and down,
including all of us girls, cheering so damn loud there's no way I'm going to
hear anything my professor says tomorrow.
As much as the opponent fights, they can't do it, and just three minutes
later, the Carolina Comets are Stanley Cup champions for the second time
in their franchise history.
We're escorted by security down to the ice, and before I know it, I'm
being swooped up into Fitz's arms.
“I'm so—”
My words are cut off by the best kiss of my life, and that's saying
something because I've been kissing Fitz every day for six months now.
“I love you, I love you, I love you,” he says, punctuating each word
with a kiss.
“I'm so proud of you!” I tell him.
He's worked tirelessly toward this over the last several months. Every
day is hockey, hockey, hockey. Being here to see his dream come true…it's
everything I didn't know I wanted.
“Thank you,” he tells me, molding his hands to my face in that familiar
way I've grown so damn used to.
“For what?”
“For being you. For being here. For being mine. I don't know how I got
so damn lucky, but I promise to never, ever take it for granted. You mean
everything to me, Ro, and I promise to spend the rest of my life proving that
to you.”
I grin up at him. “I think I'd like that very much.”
“Yeah?”
I nod. “Yeah.”
“Good. Because I love you. More than strawberries even.”
I gasp playfully. “Well, I never.”
He shakes his head. “You knew. You've always known.”
And I do know. I always have.
Four and a half years ago, I realized I was madly in love with my best
friend, the guy I grew up next door to and had known my entire life.
Three and a half years ago, I was ready to tell him I loved him. I just
needed to find the right time. This was big, life-changing. I couldn't just
spring it on him. It had to be right.
Three years ago, everything fell apart when he told me he'd met the
love of his life and was moving out of the country and the lease on the
apartment we shared wasn't going to be renewed.
Two and a half years ago, I vowed to make my life into my own.
Two years ago, I met a man, not knowing he was going to change
everything.
After some heartbreak and uncertainty, I made him mine.
And as of tonight, I'm more in love with him than I've ever been.
This is everything I've been waiting for, and I'm never letting it go.
BONUS EPILOGUE
Fitz
Winning the Cup was easily one of the best days of my life, but every time I
look over at the woman beside me, I know one day it's going to pale in
comparison to when I officially make her my wife.
I stroke my finger over the ring that's adorning her hand. I proposed a
week ago, our first night in Spain before all the other Comets filtered in for
our group vacation. We decided we needed a break after winning the Cup
and settled on a trip to a place none of us have been before.
“Babe, can you get my back?” Rosie hands me a bottle of sunscreen,
then turns around in her chair.
“Babe, can you get my back?” Miller mocks from across the way.
“Shut up, Miller,” just about everyone says to him, including me.
Some things never change, like my love for Rosie. We moved in
together just before the Playoffs, and Carl has been having a blast in the
new place. I'm having a blast not being worried about her getting locked in
the pantry and not worrying about seeing my eighty-year-old neighbor
naked.
It's a win-win for us.
I uncap the sunscreen, squirt some into my hand, and begin rubbing
down my gorgeous fiancée. I fiddle with the strings on her orange bikini,
wishing so badly we were alone so I could pull her top off and show her just
how much I love her in the midday sun.
Who the hell thought a group vacation was a good idea again?
“Man, I'm so glad we could all do this together,” Miller says.
Oh, right. Him.
“I'm here with my favorite people and my favorite girl.” He winks at
Scout. “And I'm the proud owner of a new title: Stanley Cup Champion.”
“You already had that title,” I remind him, rubbing the lotion into
Rosie's soft skin.
“You're right. Two-time Stanley Cup Champion.” He takes a sip of his
beer, then smacks his lips obnoxiously. “What a fucking life, huh?”
“It's pretty nice,” Lowell agrees. “And as much as I love my kids, I'm
so glad to have a break.”
“I'll drink to that.” Hollis clinks her drink against Lowell's beer.
“Though I do miss them.”
“I miss Macie,” Greer complains, frowning down at his phone like he's
trying to convince himself not to check in on her. “She'd love this. We
could be building sandcastles right now.”
“No way. She's too cool for us now.” Stevie rolls her eyes. “If she were
here, she'd probably be at the pool with those boys we saw earlier.”
“Boys? Fuck no!” Greer gets up like he's going to go beat some kids up,
and Stevie tugs him back down into his chair, patting his back.
“Chill out. She's safe at home with her grandpa. There is no way he or
Ernesto would let any boys near her.”
“Um, you're both nuts. If anyone is going to chase boys away, it's
Macie herself. My niece can handle things just fine,” Scout says.
“Quit whining about your kids. I miss my dogs.” Collin juts his lip out.
“They're probably doing awful without me.”
“Um, based on the photo Grams sent me, I doubt that,” Ryan says.
“They're living their best life with Frodo and Poe.”
“I really don't know how my mother is handling all those animals and
the kids and still has time to hang out with your grandmother.” Harper
shakes her head.
“Because Mom is a badass,” Hollis tells her sister. “Duh.”
“Yeah, duh, Harper,” Miller says.
“Shut up, Miller.”
I don't even know who says it this time, but it still makes me laugh.
“Um, Fitz?”
“Hmm?”
“I don't think I need sunscreen on my ass.”
“Huh?” I look down and—yep, my hand is totally inside her bikini
bottoms. “Oops.”
She giggles, then swings back around, settling back into her chair. I toss
the sunscreen aside, then reach over and drag her closer to me because the
foot of space between us is entirely too much.
I'm addicted to this woman, and it's an addiction I'll gladly let rule my
life. There's no way I'll ever get enough of her, no matter how much time
we spend together. I'm going to soak it all in now while I can before we get
back to North Carolina and reality, where I'll be busy with hockey and
she'll be busy with her second year of college.
She's kicking ass, and I'm not surprised. Scout's even been helping her
as she tries to find a location for her bakery. It's still a few years off, but she
says there's no harm in starting to plan now. Rosie no longer streams, and
all the sexy pictures she takes are sent directly to me. I wouldn't have an
issue if she still wanted to do it, but she says I'm giving her everything she
ever wanted.
“Hey, Ro,” I whisper to her.
“Yes, Ivan?”
“I love you, future wife.”
She grins. “I love you more, future husband.”
“Aww, that's so sweet I could—”
“SHUT UP, MILLER!”
Everyone laughs, shaking their heads at him. He's as exhausting as ever
and we had to physically restrain him from packing his karaoke machine,
but we still love him.
“Hayes, what's up, man? Why the long face?” Smith asks while
casually playing with Emilia's hair as she sits in his lap. “Strike out on
Tinder again?”
Hayes, the only single one here, is staring down at the phone in his
hand, looking completely dejected. It's several more seconds before he
looks up, and I'm not at all expecting the next words that leave him.
“I just got off the phone with my agent. I'm not playing for the Comets
next season.”
“What? Where are you going?”
“Seattle.” He swallows roughly. “I'm going to be playing for the Seattle
Serpents.”

TESSA
Never in my life did I expect to be attending a fancy-as-hell party like this.
Glitz and glam aren't really for me. I function best at home in my pajamas,
pretending I'm not emotionally attached to my couch.
Cozy and comfortable are my middle names, so why I'm currently
walking into a skyrise apartment wearing a skintight glittery red dress is
beyond me. I'd much rather be at my house alone than surrounded by
people I've never met and don't share interests with.
“Relax, Tessa.”
“I am relaxed,” I tell my best friend, the evil woman who dragged me to
this party.
“How tightly you're squeezing my arm tells me otherwise.”
I look down at where my fingers are wrapped around Piper's arm, and
based on how white my knuckles are and how red her skin is, she's right.
I'm not relaxed. I am so far from relaxed it's not even funny.
“Sorry,” I mutter. “It's just…” I wave my free hand. “This. It's a lot.
And I feel weird in this dress.”
“Well, that's ridiculous. You look Jessica Rabbit with all that gorgeous
red hair of yours.”
“Exactly, I look like a cartoon.”
“A hot cartoon.” She winks. “The guys are going to have their tongues
hanging out of their mouths when they see you.”
“I'm not interested, Piper. I'm nursing a broken heart.”
My best friend has, hands down, one of the coolest jobs…if you're into
hockey, that is. Unfortunately, I'm not, so I'm not overly impressed that she
works with hockey players daily as part of their social media team. It's a
dream job for her, though, so when she asked me to be her date for their
annual beginning-of-the-season party, I couldn't tell her no.
“It was six months of your life, and Bryan was an ass. You'll get over
him soon enough. Besides, you know how the saying goes: if you're
heartbroken, find a new dick to ride.”
I snort out a laugh. “I really don't think that's a saying at all.”
“It sounds good to me.” She shrugs. “This party is crawling with hot,
eligible guys. Find one.”
“You know these guys aren't my type. I'm in—”
“Into sad, mopey, emo boys who write poetry and like silent artistic
films.” She lifts her brown eyes skyward. “I know, but look how that's
turned out.”
I groan because she's right. I definitely have a type, but it's not escaped
my notice that every relationship I've ever had has failed. You'd think I'd
take that as a sign to find a different type, but I always drift back to what's
familiar then get bummed when the sex is stale and it doesn't work out.
“I can introduce you to a few guys I work with on the social media
team, or even a few trainers. Some of them are a bit older but hot.” She
bounces her brows.
“I think I can manage to find someone on my own, but I appreciate the
support.”
She shrugs. “Your loss.” A grin pulls at her lips. “Or my gain.”
I laugh, letting her tug me inside the elevator. Piper digs into her tiny
purse, pulls out a compact mirror, and checks her makeup even though it's
flawless.
“You're gorgeous. Stop fussing with it.”
She snaps the case closed then drops it back into her purse. “Thank you,
but you're my best friend—you have to tell me that.”
“No, as your best friend, it's my duty to tell you when you don't look
gorgeous.”
“Yeah, but you never tell me when that happens.”
“That's because you always look gorgeous.” I bump her hip with mine,
grinning at her.
She's like the heroines in movies who always wake up with perfect
makeup and hair and never look at all disheveled.
She rolls her eyes just as the doors slide open, and my breath catches in
my throat at the view in front of me. There's a vast glass spread with double
doors leading out to the party. It's easily the grandest entrance to a rooftop
I've ever seen.
“Damn.” Piper lets out a low whistle. “This is nice.”
“I already feel out of place.”
“I work with these people, and I agree.”
The second she pushes the doors open, I'm assaulted by the music
thrumming through the speakers. It's loud but not unbearable, and I'm
thankful for that. The only thing I hate more than going out is going
somewhere so loud you can't hear what the person standing next to you is
saying.
“Drinks?” Piper asks.
“Lots of them. Stat.”
She shakes her head at me with a smile, fully aware of my distaste for
crowds, then pulls me along to the bar on the other side of the roof.
Piper nods and smiles at several people as we weave our way through
the crowd, but she doesn't stop, in hot pursuit of alcohol.
“Two Cosmos, please,” Piper says to the bartender when we reach the
bar.
He nods then busies himself with making our cocktails.
I turn back toward the party to take it all in. The decor is upscale with
tall tables scattered about, sophisticated-looking centerpieces adorning
each. There are lanterns strung up around the perimeter of the space and a
cute little photo booth off to one side that two couples are currently
occupying, taking goofy photos with props. Then there's the city as the
backdrop, the moon appearing to be so close you'd swear you'd be able to
touch it if you were to reach out.
But the party isn't the only thing I notice. It's the people too. Each
person's outfit looks as expensive as my rent, and they're all sipping out of
real glasses and not plastic cups. There's a mix of beautiful women and
equally beautiful men, but the guys are what stand out. Nearly all of them
are giants, easily over six feet, which feels enormous compared to my five
feet and three inches. Their jaws are sharp, their muscles look like they're
about to bust out of their shirts, and I swear I've seen at least two of them
on the cover of a romance novel.
“This is…”
“Incredible, right?” my best friend finishes for me. “And it's all paid for
by the team captain.”
She points toward the attractive man sitting on the other side of the roof,
spread out on the couch. His arm is slung across the back, and a woman
with dark hair is snuggled up against him, looking up at him like he hung
the moon.
“That's Lowell,” Piper tells me. “He's the captain.” She points to the
woman next to him. “That's his baby mama, Hollis. And that…” She shifts
the focus to another couple. “That's Wright and Harper, then Rhodes and
Ryan. Miller and his lady, Scout. Next to them are Greer and Stevie. They
just started dating earlier this year, but it's serious. Then, of course, Fitz
and…”
She rattles off several more names and some positions. I do my best to
pay attention, but keeping up is hard. I highly doubt I'm going to remember
a single person after tonight. This isn't my scene, and I don't plan on
changing that any time soon.
“And that guy right there is Ford.”
My eyes follow her finger, and there's no mistaking the stuttered breath
that leaves me when I see the person she's talking about staring right at us.
No. That's not right.
He's staring right at me.
“He's new to the team—a trade from Toronto during the summer—but
he's already making a big splash on the social media pages, and I can see
why. I swear, sometimes the way he looks at the camera makes my panties
melt, and I see these hot guys daily, so I'm basically immune at this point.”
I don't blame her. I can't imagine how anyone in the world could be
immune to this man.
His jaw is chiseled and strong and covered in stubble. His nose is
slightly crooked, like he's been hit there once or twice. His brows are
perfectly shaped, and his lips are full—kissable even. His dark hair is styled
perfectly, not a single hair out of place, and his crisp gray dress shirt is
unbuttoned just enough that you can see his chest hair peeking out. I've
never really been into chest hair before, but I'm hit with the sudden urge to
run my finger through it.
Even though I'm standing on the opposite side of the roof, I can see his
eyes from here.
Blue.
A bright, piercing blue.
The kind of blue you could get lost in for days.
And maybe…just maybe…I wouldn't mind getting lost in them.
“Here you go, ladies,” the bartender says, pulling my attention from the
man still staring at me.
I try to ignore him as I turn around and grab my drink. I pull a few
dollars from my small clutch, drop them into his tip jar, and sip my cocktail.
“Oh crap,” Piper mutters, and I look in the direction of where she's
currently shooting daggers.
Some guy is standing at the double doors, bumping fists with a few
others before sticking his hands into his pockets. He looks this way as if he
can feel us staring at him. The second he spots Piper, a grin curls at the
corners of his lips. It's one of those expressions that's a little sinister but
somehow still hot.
I don't miss the way my best friend reacts to it. She likes him—a lot.
“Who is that?”
“That's Steele, the guy I've been telling you about.”
“The player who is constantly ruining your shots?” She nods. “Well,
you didn't mention Steele is hot.”
“Oh, I didn't?” She clamps her bottom lip between her teeth, but only
for a moment. Then she's straightening her back and tossing her long dark
hair over her shoulder. “That's because his assholery surpasses his looks.”
“Right. Sure.”
I don't believe her for a second. She didn't tell me about him because
it's obvious she's into him—big time.
“I'm going to go talk to him. Get it over with, you know? Then I can
enjoy my night.”
“Makes total sense.”
“Stop smiling at me like that.” She narrows her eyes, which makes me
smile even wider. “Stop it.”
“What? I'm not smiling at you. I'm just smiling. Smiling is my
favorite.”
“Okay, Buddy the Elf.” She rolls her eyes, and I'm not sure if it's at me
or due to her distaste for Will Ferrell and Christmas movies, but either way,
it makes me laugh. “I'll be right back.”
I watch as she sashays across the rooftop party, heading directly for the
hockey player she supposedly hates. His demeanor changes the moment she
approaches, and it becomes abundantly clear to me that he's just as into her
as she is into him.
“Who are we watching?”
I startle at the sudden intrusion then look to my right where the voice
came from, stumbling back when my eyes collide with those same baby
blues.
The man reaches out, grabbing my arm to steady me, and my skin feels
like it's on fire the moment he touches me. It's like his fingers have a direct
link to my soul, and I'm burning alive from the inside out.
He's staring down at me with a look that makes me feel like he's on the
hunt for something…for someone.
I roll my tongue along my dry lips. “Excuse me?”
The corners of his eyes crinkle, and one side of his mouth kicks up in a
smirk that should be illegal because it has no business being so damn hot.
What is wrong with me? Since when do I find hockey players attractive?
“You were watching someone intently,” he says. “I was curious who.”
I glance down to where he's still touching me. He follows my gaze then
slowly pulls his hand away, but it's almost like he doesn't want to pull his
hand away.
Honestly, I don't think I want him to either because I miss his touch the
moment he does.
“So, who are we watching?” he asks again, his deep voice sliding over
me, touching me in places I'm not expecting, like right between my legs.
“My friend.”
He brings his tumbler to his lips, sipping on the amber liquid inside as
he lifts his brow, silently asking me to elaborate.
“She pretends she hates this guy, but she doesn't. It's painfully obvious
she's attracted to him.” I slam my hand over my mouth, surprised I just put
my best friend's business out there to a total stranger. “I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have told you that. You're a stranger. I don't even know you.”
His eyes narrow briefly before he says, “Ford.”
“Huh?”
“I'm Ford. But I assume you knew that already.”
Those damn azure eyes are piercing into me. They're mesmerizing. And
distracting. Like make-my-head-fuzzy kind of distracting.
I swallow thickly. “I…did. I knew that.”
His kissable lips twitch slightly. “Well, now that you know my name,
we're not strangers.” He winks. “Is that your friend? The one talking to
Steele?”
I nod. “That's her.”
“She works for the team, right?”
“Yes. The social media department.”
“And you? Do you work for the team?”
I shake my head. “N-No.”
His grin widens. “Good.”
“G-Good?”
“Good.”
I don't know why it's good. I want to ask him, but I'm afraid of his
answer.
So instead of asking for clarification, I change the subject. “So, you play
for the Comets, right?”
He nods. “I do. But you already knew that too.”
Heat rushes to my cheeks. He must have been paying more attention to
me than I thought.
“I might have heard something,” I mutter, bringing my drink to my lips
and gulping it down quickly. I set the empty glass on the bar.
“Another?” the bartender asks.
“Please,” I reply.
Ford chuckles, and it's a soft yet deep sound. I like it. He shakes his
now empty tumbler at the bartender, who nods, acknowledging his silent
request for another drink.
“So,” Ford says, “you know my name. Do I get to know yours?”
“It's Tessa.”
“Tessa,” he repeats, like he's testing it out. “What brings you here
tonight, Tessa?”
“Piper.”
“The friend, right?”
“Yes. It's a company party, and she works for the team, so…”
“So you came to be a supportive friend?”
The bartender slides our fresh drinks over, and I don't miss it when Ford
slips a twenty in the man's jar. I like that he does that.
“Exactly.”
“But you don't really want to be here, do you?”
A laugh escapes me. “Is it that obvious?”
“Well, when you walked in, you were scowling, and that's pretty much
a dead giveaway.”
He saw me walk in?
“Of course I saw you walk in,” he says.
Crap. I must have said that out loud.
Ford leans down, his lips barely brushing against my ear. The slight
touch sends a shiver through me. “You're hard to miss in a dress like that.”
I tug at the hem of said dress, pulling it down, trying to cover my bare
legs. I don't usually wear anything this short, but I felt feisty last week
when I picked it out.
A hand lands on top of mine, and I halt my movements.
“Don't,” he instructs quietly.
So, I don't. I stop fussing with the fabric. Instead, I put my hands to
better use and pick up my drink, taking a big gulp. I feel Ford's eyes on me
the entire time, just like I feel my body heat up and my palms get sweaty,
even against my cool glass.
It's him. I know it is.
“Is it just you and Piper here tonight, Tessa?”
I nod.
It's dumb. I'm dumb. I shouldn't tell this man I'm here alone.
But I do it anyway.
“Good,” he says again.
This time, when he says it, it sounds like a promise.
A promise of what, I don't know.
But whatever it is, I hope he keeps it.

FORD
I didn't want to come tonight.
In fact, I almost didn't. I almost blew the entire thing off.
Then I got a text from the team captain saying attendance was
mandatory, even if only for an hour, and I knew I couldn't say no. I'm the
new guy, and pissing off my captain isn't how I want to start my run with
the Comets.
I won't lie, I was surly about it at first. Sitting around drinking and
waiting for midnight on the rooftop of this hotel isn't my favorite way to
spend an evening. I'd rather be in sweats, sipping a beer and reviewing the
tapes from the game two nights ago, trying to figure out why the hell we
lost when we were up four-nothing in the third period.
But now, with Tessa standing next to me, I'm suddenly very glad I made
the last-minute decision to attend.
I was just about to call it a night when she walked through the door
looking like a wet dream come to life. Her red hair is loosely curled, falling
just below her shoulders, and her red glittery dress looks like it's painted
onto her body, hugging every curve she has just perfectly.
As gorgeous as it is on her, I want to strip it off. Badly. But those heels
she's wearing? They can stay. I'm dying to see what they feel like wrapped
around me and digging into my back.
But…we'll get there soon.
“Do you want to grab a table?”
Her eyes flick over to her friend, the one who is still completely
wrapped up in Steele, then come back to mine. “Sure.”
I do my best not to place my hand on her lower back as I let her lead us
to an unoccupied table, but I don't bother trying to hide the fact that I'm
very much enjoying how good her ass looks in her dress, and I let my eyes
slide over her body.
“So,” she says when she stops. She sets her Cosmo down then rests her
forearms on the table, her fingers going to the fruit-laden toothpick resting
on top of her glass. She spins it around, toying with it. “I hear you're new to
hockey. How's that going for you?”
I lift my brows. “You heard I'm new to hockey?”
“Yes?”
I can't help but laugh at the uncertainty of her response.
“I'm not new to hockey, Tessa. I've been playing since I was five years
old.”
“Five? That's a hell of a commitment.”
“It is, but it doesn't feel like work when you love what you do.”
“So, not new to hockey but new to the team?”
I nod. “Yes. I just got here about two weeks ago.”
While I loved playing in Toronto, I'm glad I got sent to Carolina. This
team they've built has a damn good chance of winning the Cup this year,
and I intend to help them.
“Your friend works for the team and is obviously a hockey fan. Does
that mean you go to the games? Or watch them?”
“Nope,” she says, popping the P loudly. “Sports are not my thing at all.”
“Uh-oh. It sounds like there's a story there. Recent breakup?”
“Yes, but not with a jock.”
“But you have dated a jock before.”
She wiggles her lips back and forth like she's not sure if she wants to
dive into her dating history with some guy she's just met.
“Yes, my high school sweetheart. He broke my heart when he cheated
on me with, oh, just about every girl in school, and I didn't find out about it
until I followed him to college…where he did it all over again.”
“He sounds like a prick.”
“He was.”
“Was?”
“Is.” She lifts her shoulders. “I'm not sure. I haven't spoken to him
since I dropped out of college.”
“You left college because of him?”
“Yes. But only after I slept with his best friend then swore off jocks for
the rest of my life.”
I roll my lips together, trying to hide my grin, feeling damn proud of
this woman I barely know. “Good for you. Bad for me though.”
She lifts a perfectly shaped brow. “Bad for you?”
“Jock.” I wave a hand over myself. “Kind of ruins my chances, no?”
She eyes me with the most gorgeous hazel gaze I've ever seen, tipping
her head to the side and sizing me up. Then, she slowly rakes her eyes over
me.
I like it. I like having her stare at me like this. I like having her full
attention. Maybe a little too much even.
I can't help it. There's just something about her that I like. I like her
indifference about being here. I like that she's not just some puck bunny
chasing a new player of the week.
“I guess we'll see how the night goes,” she finally says, and it sparks a
whole new part of me.
“I guess we will.” I bring my scotch to my lips, taking a swig. “So,
you're not a hockey fan, you hate jocks, and you're here against your will.
Anything else I should know about you?”
“I'm allergic to nuts.”
“Noted.”
“And I'm a graphic designer. I make romance book covers.”
“You make romance book covers?”
She straightens her back, lifting her chin, almost like she's prepping to
defend herself. “Yes.”
“Do you like it?”
“I love it. It's not as cool as being a pro athlete, but it's fun.”
“Do you know Miller's girl Scout then?”
“No. I haven't met anyone on the team yet.”
“Yeah?” I push off the table and spin toward the crowd, cupping my
hand around my mouth. “Yo, Miller!”
The gifted young player lifts his head in our direction at the sound of
my voice, and I wave him over. He rises off the couch, and just as I
expected, his girlfriend Scout follows closely behind him.
“Hey, Ford,” Miller says, bumping his fist against mine. “What's up,
man?”
“I wanted to introduce you to someone. This is Tessa. She designs
romance book covers.”
Scout's eyes widen, and she grins over at Tessa, who looks white as a
ghost. “Do you really?”
Tessa nods. “Yes. I'm not sure if you're a reader, but…”
“Reader? I mean, yeah, she's a total book nerd—which is sexy as hell,”
Miller says, sliding his arm around Scout's waist. “But she's also an
author.”
“Oh my god, Miller. Stop it,” Scout hisses to her boyfriend.
“You are?” Tessa says, sounding extra excited. “Do you write
romance?”
“I, um, I…” Scout brushes her hair behind her ear. “Yes. Have you
heard of Hooking Up with the Hockey Player?”
“Heard of it? I loved that book. And the second one too.” Tessa's mouth
drops open like she's just connected the dots. “That's you, isn't it?”
Scout nods. “That's me.”
“Shut up! Those covers are incredible, by the way.”
“Thank you. I'm always in the market to add people to my team, so if
you're ever taking new clients, I'd love to—”
“Yes!” Tessa interrupts her, then slaps her hand over her mouth. “Oh
god, I'm sorry. That was so rude. But yes! Yes, I'm interested.”
Scout laughs. “Good. Send me a friend request, and we'll get something
set up.”
Tessa claps her hands together. “Ahhh! Thank you!”
“Miller! Scout!”
The guy in question sighs. “Sorry. We should…” He jerks his head
toward where the voice came from. “Coffee before practice on Monday?”
“Sure,” I tell him. “I'll text you.”
“It was great to meet you, Tessa.”
“You, too. And, uh, just between you and me, there's no such thing as
too much smut.”
Scout laughs. “I agree with you there.”
Tessa watches her leave with stars in her eyes, entirely captivated by the
woman she just met.
“So, you don't like jocks, but you do like reading about them?”
The beautiful redhead turns my way with a shrug. “It's fiction. Fiction is
different from reality. I don't like the idea of being kidnapped by a mafia
boss, but it's totally hot in a romance novel.”
I chuckle. “Noted.”
“Do you read?” Tessa asks.
“I listen to a lot of audiobooks on plane rides. Not sure if that counts.”
“Audiobooks totally count as reading. Don't let anyone tell you
otherwise.”
“Well, that's good to know. I'm at least halfway to my personal pan
pizza, then.”
She laughs. “Oh man, I used to get at least four a year. I miss that
incentive.”
“Have you always been a reader?”
“I was an only child. I had a lot of free time.” She shrugs. “What do you
listen to?”
“Thrillers, mostly. Sometimes biographies.”
“I've tried to dip my toes into thrillers, even liked a few, but I always
missed the kissing scenes and went straight back to romance.”
“Ah, so that's what you're in it for—the sex.”
There's a spark in her eyes, and she shuffles around, shifting her eyes
across the party, looking everywhere except at me.
“What's wrong, Tessa? Not getting satisfied in other ways?”
Her movements halt, and her eyes reach mine. This time she's not
smiling or looking timid. No, this time, her eyes are narrowed.
“That's none of your business.”
“So, that's a no, then.”
She doesn't answer, which is telling enough.
I hate that she's not being satisfied, and I hate more that I feel like I
need to fix that. I don't have any business getting involved with someone. I
have a season to win. I don't have time to get swept up in…well, her.
But I'll be damned if I don't want to.
“Hey, Tessa?”
She sighs but drags her hazel gaze to mine, lifting her Cosmo to her
lips.
“Yes?”
“Would you like to be somewhere else?”
She stops mid-drink, eyes wide. “Are you asking me to leave with you,
Ford?”
“I am.”
She blinks twice, surprised by my blunt answer.
Then she stares.
And stares some more.
Just when I think I should backtrack or walk away, it's Tessa's turn to
deliver a surprise of her own.
“Yes.”

TESSA
I don't know what I'm doing.
Wait. No, I do know what I'm doing—I just can't figure out why I'm
doing it.
Wait. That's not true, either.
I'm doing it because Ford is hot, like stupidly hot—possibly even the
hottest man I've ever seen—and because there's something about him that I
can't seem to say no to. Something I don't want to say no to. He's not the
kind of guy I'd usually go home with, and maybe that's what is so damn hot
about it.
“I'm, uh, I'll just be a minute. I'm going to let Piper know I'm leaving.”
“You mean your friend who just slipped into the elevator with Steele?”
He bounces his eyes in that direction, and I look over my shoulder just
in time to see the doors slide closed, but not before catching a glimpse of
Piper's shimmery gold dress.
Hmm. Interesting.
“I'll text her then.”
I pull my phone from my purse, only to find a text already waiting for
me.
Piper: I'll be right back! Don't leave!
Me: About that…
Me: I'm fine. I promise. I just got a headache. Too many
Cosmos, I think. Stay and have fun. I'll see you when you get
home tonight.
Ford laughs, and I realize then that he's moved and is standing behind me,
peeking over my shoulder at my screen.
“What?” I ask.
“Do you have anything to do tomorrow?”
I shake my head. “No.”
“Good.” He leans down, his breath tickling my ear as he says, “Because
I have plans for you, Little Red.”
I should be scared.
I should be worried.
Hell, I should tell this man he's insane. I should walk away.
But I don't do any of that.
Instead, I find myself saying… “What kind of plans?”
“The kind that lasts all night.”
I swallow the lump that's formed in my throat. “Then, we had better get
started.”
With a grin, Ford places his hand on the small of my back, and his touch
burns my skin through my dress as he leads me away from the party. A few
people smile at us and say hello, but he doesn't stop. He's on a mission, and
his impatience makes me that much more excited for what's in store.
We step through the double glass doors, and the loud thumping of the
music quiets. It almost feels too quiet as Ford presses the button to call the
elevator car. We're standing in front of the doors just waiting like this is an
everyday thing, like we're not about to screw each other's brains out.
I dare a peek up at him. He's so…tall. Gigantic next to me, really. Even
with my heels on, the top of my head doesn't reach his shoulders. I wonder
if that means other parts of him are going to be big too…
The doors open, and we step onto the elevator. Ford stands beside me,
his hand still resting on my lower back, branding me.
When the doors close again, I take my first real breath in what feels like
hours.
“If you want to change your mind, you can,” Ford tells me in that deep
timbre of his. “No harm, no foul.”
“I don't,” I answer honestly, peering up at him. “I want this.”
“Good.”
It's the last thing he says before he smashes the emergency stop button
on the elevator, then his mouth crashes to mine. My back hits a wall and he
cups my face in his hands, holding me still while he devours my mouth with
his. His tongue sweeps against mine, brushing it in small strokes.
I wonder if this is what I have to look forward to for the rest of the night
—kisses that feel like he's imprinting on every fiber of my being.
It's magical. He's magical.
He lets out a low groan and it vibrates through me, right between my
legs where my panties are already soaked through from his kisses alone.
“This…tonight…it's not going to be enough. I already know it,” he
mutters.
But that's all he says before he's kissing me again. His fingers dance
along the hem of my dress, tugging at it, toying with the fabric and with me.
His knuckles graze along the exposed skin and I want to cry because it feels
so good, which is ridiculous. It's just a soft brush. I shouldn't be about to
explode from that alone.
But Ford… This… I'm close to combusting already, and all he's done is
kiss me.
“Please,” I whisper against his lips.
He laughs darkly. “Oh, Little Red. You're going to have to do better
than that.”
“Please, Ford. Touch me.”
“Touch what, Tessa? What do you want me to touch?”
“My…” I swallow. “My…”
“Your pussy?” he asks, cupping me between my legs. I hiss at the
contact. “God, you're soaked. So fucking wet. That's all for me, isn't it?”
I nod. “Yes.”
“Say it.”
“My pussy… This is all for you, Ford.”
“You're damn right it is.” He growls against me then slips his fingers
behind the silk material. I gasp when the pad of his finger brushes against
my throbbing clit, and he laughs that same sinister laugh again. “Fucking
hell. You're going to taste so sweet.”
Suddenly, he's on his knees.
He's on his knees and he's pushing my dress up.
He's pushing my dress up and he's pressing his face against me,
inhaling me.
“You smell fucking divine,” he mutters before covering me with his
mouth through my panties.
“Holy…” My eyes roll back in my head, and I swear I'm seeing stars as
my legs begin to shake.
Am I…?
“I'm coming,” I murmur, completely shocked.
He laughs against me, sending even more shockwaves through my
body.
But he doesn't stop there. No. He pulls my panties down my legs,
tucking them into the pocket of his dress pants before grabbing one of my
legs, throwing it over his shoulder, and burying his face between my legs.
My fingers slide through his hair as he licks at me, running his tongue
over me before sucking my clit into his mouth. Then, he does it all over
again, tasting and devouring every inch of me.
It's heaven. Absolute heaven. There's nothing that could be better than
this moment right here.
My orgasm builds as he eats at me, my legs shaking more and more by
the second until it slams into me, knocking my breath from my lungs. I do
my best not to cry out in relief when the waves wash over me.
When the shaking finally subsides, so does his assault. Ford sits back on
his haunches, his own breath heavy as he looks up at me with dark eyes, his
face glistening with the evidence of what just happened.
“That was…” I gulp. “Wow.”
His lips twitch. “Good wow?”
I nod. “Very good wow.”
He rises to his feet, tugging my dress down on his way up. He slides one
hand over my waist, pulling me closer to him. “Good. There's more where
that came from.”
“More?” The single word comes out a squeak.
He chuckles. “A lot more if I have it my way.”
He hits the button on the elevator, and it begins to move again. He
doesn't stop touching me, not even when we stop on the tenth floor. I'm
surprised when the doors open and there's nobody there.
Ford grabs my hand, guiding me out of the elevator.
“Where are we going?”
“My room.”
“You have a room here?”
He nods. “The whole team does. If we're drinking, we're staying. Those
are the rules.”
“How convenient for you.”
He lifts a brow. “And you, too.”
He pulls us to a stop in front of a door then pulls his keycard from his
pocket and lets us inside his room. The lights are off, but thanks to the
expansive window overlooking the city, I can still see just fine.
I stop just inside the door, suddenly feeling nervous about this. I mean,
the guy just had his mouth on my pussy. I shouldn't be nervous, but I am.
“Tessa…” Ford gathers my hair in his hand, pushing it to one side. He
drops his lips to the exposed skin, pressing soft kisses against me. “We can
stop whenever you want.”
“I don't want to. I just…” I sigh when he kisses a spot that I love. He
notices, then does it again.
“You just what?” he prompts.
“I don't know what to do next,” I confess. “This isn't… I don't
normally do this.”
In fact, I've never done this. I usually don't sleep with a guy until we've
been seeing one another for at least a month, but there's just something
about Ford that I can't seem to resist.
“We can move at your pace.”
I melt at his words. I shouldn't, really. It should be the standard, a guy
being understanding and patient, but that's not always the case, so it's a
welcome change.
“I want to move at your pace,” I tell him honestly.
“Are you sure?” he asks, his lips still brushing against my skin, causing
it to prickle under his touch. “Because I want you to be really sure, Tessa.
I'm not… I'm not gentle.”
Oh god. I had a feeling he'd say that, but hearing him confirm it? It
sends a zing through me that I'm not expecting. I like the idea of him not
being gentle. I really like it.
I nod. “I'm sure.”
“Good.”
It's all he says before he slides a hand up my back. It's a gentle touch,
soft. And it's a stark contrast to what happens next.
He wraps my long hair around his fist, tugging my head back with a
yank that's somewhere between discomfort and bliss.
His lips find my ear. “Do you see that chair over there?”
My eyes dart to the one across the room, bathed in moonlight.
“I see it.”
“I'm going to strip this dress from your body, then I'm going to sit in
that chair while you drop to your hands and knees and wait for further
instruction. Understand?”
My eyes drift to the uncovered window. It's so big and so open there is
no way someone in a building across the way won't be able to see me. I
should be worried about that. I should care.
I'm not and I don't. Let them see. Let them watch.
I nod.
“Words, Tessa. I need words.”
“Yes.”
“Yes, what?”
“Sir.” The word falls out naturally like it's something I've been saying
to him for years and he's not some guy I just met tonight. “Yes, sir.”
“That's my girl,” he mutters.
He releases my hair, and I hear him toe his shoes off. Then his hands are
on me, working the zipper on my dress. The sound of the metal in the tracks
is the only thing that can be heard in the room as he slides it all the way
down. He gives the material a gentle tug until it pools at my feet.
There's a sharp inhale behind me.
“No bra?”
I shake my head. “No.”
“Hmm” is all he says as he steps around me.
He stops in front of me, his eyes going straight to my exposed chest. He
reaches a finger out, tracing my hard nipples.
Just when I think he might put his mouth on me, he spins on his heel
and begins to pull his shirt free from his pants as he makes his way to the
chair. He stops, faces me, then plucks each button free with careful
precision before taking a seat.
I'm mildly disappointed until I get a good look at him. He's like a damn
god sitting there with his legs spread and his hands resting on the armrests.
Seeing him sit before me…it might just be the most beautiful thing I've
ever seen.
His eyes rake over me, taking in every inch of my naked body. I've
never had a man stare at me the way Ford is—like I'm some sort of prize
he's been working toward and finally won.
I bend to remove my heels but stop the moment his deep voice floats
through the room.
“Those stay on.”
“On?”
He lifts his brow, daring me to question him again.
I don't.
“Yes, sir.”
He likes my response. “On your knees, Tessa.”
I swear my pussy gets wetter from his words alone.
On my knees for him? Yes, please!
Slowly, I drop.
He grins.
“Now crawl.”
So, I do.
At first, I feel ridiculous. Crawling? For a man? Who am I?
But then I watch the way Ford looks at me. I see how his eyes light up,
see how much he's loving this, how hard this is making his cock. Seeing
him enjoying it makes me enjoy it. It makes me feel powerful and sexy.
When I get to his spread legs, I stop then sit up.
“Very good,” he purrs, tucking a single finger under my chin and lifting
it until I'm looking into his heated cobalt eyes. “Now, I want you to take my
cock out.”
“And what?”
Another arch of his brow. “You wait.”
“Yes, sir.”
With unsteady hands—the shakiness pure eagerness at this point—I
reach for the expensive belt he's wearing and undo it. I unsnap his dress
pants then tug down the zipper. He rises up just enough for me to pull the
material down his thighs along with his boxer briefs.
His cock springs free, and my mouth waters at the sight. I was right—
he's big here too. Maybe even too big, if there is such a thing. I have no
idea how I'm going to fit him in my mouth.
“I'll fit.”
I look up to find him watching me intently, his eyes dark and hungry.
“Do you want me to prove it?” I find myself nodding. “Bring your
mouth here.”
I scoot closer and lean forward.
“Tongue out,” he instructs.
I listen.
He drops the weight of his cock onto my tongue. It's heavy and hard in
all the right ways.
I love it, but more than that, I want more.
I need more.
“Show me how much of a good girl you are and suck my cock, Tessa.”

FORD
God, seeing her crawling… It did something to me.
She looked perfect, like a fucking angel as she slunk across the floor on
all fours. She looked like my angel, and I want nothing more than to see my
angel beg for mercy.
“Show me how much of a good girl you are and suck my cock, Tessa.”
She doesn't miss a beat. She wraps her tongue around the head, drawing
me into her mouth as she slowly works her way down, taking me inch by
inch. It's almost painful having to hold back because all I want to do right
now is sweep her hair into my fist and fuck her mouth until that pretty
makeup she's wearing makes streaks down her face.
Almost like she can tell what I'm thinking, she peers up at me, letting
my cock drop from her lips.
“Please,” she begs in a whisper.
“Please what?”
“Use me.”
“You want more?”
She nods, then remembers to use her words. “Yes, sir.”
Her plea is like music to my fucking ears, a symphony only I can hear. I
could listen to it all day.
I rise to my feet, letting my pants fall to my ankles, then gather her long
hair in my hands. It's soft and smells like honey. I want to bury my face in
it, but more than that, I want to hold on to it as I fuck her senseless.
“If you need me to stop, tell me. Three squeezes to my right leg.
Understood?”
“Yes.”
I lift my brow, and she wiggles back and forth, almost like the hard look
I'm giving her is making her squirm in all the best ways.
“Yes, sir.”
“Relax your mouth, Little Red.”
She slackens her jaw, and I slide my cock back into her warmth.
And fuck me, she takes me with ease, like she was always meant for
this moment right here.
I slide in and out with patience, letting her adjust to all of me. I slide in
deeper and deeper until I can't anymore. There's still another inch or two
that doesn't fit, but it doesn't matter. She's perfect. This is perfect.
“Your mouth was made for my cock, wasn't it?”
She nods then swallows around me.
“Fucking hell,” I mutter. “Do that again.”
She does, and I love it more than the first time. It's all it takes to set me
off, and I feed my cock down her throat.
And she takes it. She takes all of it. Even when she gags around me, she
doesn't tap out. If anything, I think she wants more.
Her eyes fill with tears, and that makeup she's wearing begins to run
down her face. It's beautiful. She's beautiful.
“You look incredible stretched around me, Little Red.”
Her eyes spark with fire at my words, loving my praise.
I'm close. Too fucking close. I don't want this to be over yet.
I slow my movements, lazily dragging my cock over her tongue as she
works to catch her breath.
“I want to come down your throat so badly,” I tell her, watching her
lavish me. “But not now. Later. Right now, I want to taste that pretty cunt of
yours on my tongue until you make a mess all over my face.”
She nods, and I pull my cock free from her mouth. She gulps air in, her
chest heaving with the respite.
I slip my finger under her chin, lifting her gaze to mine. “After I've had
my fill eating your cunt, I'm going to press you against this window and let
the entire city know you belong to me tonight. Got it?”
She rolls her tongue over her swollen lips. “I belong to you tonight.”
“That's my girl. Now, up.”
She rises to her feet, and I move her where I want her, sitting on the
chair with her legs spread wide. She looks gorgeous sitting there, her hair a
wild mess from my hands, her pink cunt on display. There's a tuft of red
hair on her mound, which drives me wild.
I kick my pants off then remove my shirt, tossing it I don't even know
where. It doesn't matter. All that matters right now is getting my mouth on
her.
And that's what I do. I drag my tongue over her pussy and nearly sigh
with relief when I taste her on my tongue.
Bliss. Pure fucking bliss. That's what she tastes like.
Tessa cries out in delight when I plunge my tongue inside, fucking her
with it and giving her a preview of what's to come later. I slide my tongue
over every inch of her pussy, loving the noises she makes while I take my
time worshipping her. Then, when she tries to run her fingers through my
hair, I stop.
She whimpers, and I laugh.
“Hands on the armrests, Little Red.”
Her bottom lip juts out, but she listens. I like that she listens.
I return to the meal spread out before me, slowly running my tongue
over her sweet cunt until she's wiggling her hips for more.
She's not going to get it. I enjoy torturing her too much. I could do it
forever. Hell, I want to do it forever. She tastes that good. She's that damn
responsive to me. I'm loving this as much as she is.
I have no idea how long I eat her or how many times she silently begs
me for more, but it's long enough that her entire body is shaking from
needing a release.
Only then do I relent and give her what she wants. I close my lips
around her clit and suck.
“Ford!” she cries out when she comes not even five seconds later.
She tries to slam her legs together, but I don't let her, holding her open
while I ride out every wave hitting her.
I'm proud that she doesn't move her hands once.
When I've wrung out every last shudder, I reluctantly drag my mouth
away and up her body, kissing her mound and stomach, tracing a path
directly to her tits, which I haven't yet had the chance to pay attention to
properly. She jumps at the contact when I close my mouth around one of
her puckered nipples, but her surprise soon becomes a moan as I suck and
nip at her until she's arching into me for more.
I pull away, taking a moment to admire her.
She's gorgeous. Absolutely fucking breathtaking.
I need to be inside of her.
Now.
The urge is overwhelming, and I reach into the pocket of my discarded
pants, plucking out a condom. I rise to my feet and cover myself with the
rubber then drag her off the chair and move her to the window as promised.
She's so lost in her post-orgasm high that she lets me shift her around
without any fight, and at this point, I'm willing to wager she'd let me do
anything to her.
“Hands on the window, Little Red.”
She presses her palms against the glass, and I kick her legs apart, loving
how her ass automatically pushes out for me.
There's no preamble. No sweet-talking. Nothing.
I slide home, burying my cock inside of her.
“Oh fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck. Ford.”
“That's right, Little Red. Say my name.”
“Ford.” It comes out a whisper—a plea.
I love it, love the way it sounds dropping off her lips. I love the way her
tits bounce in the reflection of us. I love that someone in the building across
the street is probably watching us, maybe multiple someones. I love that
she's so fucking pliant, that she's all mine tonight.
The thought spurs me on, and I give her everything I have, pounding
into her like it's my last chance to ever have her, even though I know we
have all night, and I intend to make good use of it.
I can feel my orgasm approaching and want to come so badly, but I
want Tessa to come even more.
I reach around her, pressing two fingers against her clit. “Can you give
me one more orgasm?”
She shakes her head. “No.”
“What was that?”
She tosses her head back with a groan when I halt my movements.
“Yes,” she rushes out. “Yes.”
“That's what I thought.”
I rub short circles over her, gradually picking up my pace until I'm
rutting into her without restraint. The only sounds in the room are our skin
slapping together and her moans as I rail into her and she comes on my
cock.
“Your pussy squeezes me so well,” I mutter in her ear. “Made for me
like it's mine.”
“Yes. Yours.”
“Say it again.”
“Your pussy, Ford. All yours.”
“Damn right it is.”
I slam into her, and she lets out one last loud yelp as I pull out, yanking
the condom off and jerking myself until I'm spilling all over her back,
branding her as mine.
Her legs finally give out, and I catch her around the waist before she can
fall to the floor. I tug her against me, not caring about the mess I'm
creating, just wanting to care for her.
I drag her across the hotel room and straight to the bathroom. I lift her
and deposit her on the counter then I turn on the water.
I drop to my knees once again and undo her strappy heels, taking them
off and setting them aside. She watches me the entire time, not saying a
word. She's too tired. Her eyes are heavy, like she can barely keep them
open, and a sheen of sweat is covering her body. Her makeup is a mess, her
hair even messier, but she still looks fucking edible.
When the water is ready, I drag us both into the stall. She sighs when
the hot water rushes over her but doesn't say anything.
I take my time cleaning her up, lathering my hands with the shampoo,
and cleaning her hair. I soap up a rag then rub it over her entire body, taking
my time between her legs, making sure to be extra gentle.
When I'm finished, I quickly clean myself then shut off the water. I
towel us both off, sweep her into my arms, and carry her to bed. When
we're tucked under the blanket, I pull her to my side, plastering her against
me.
“Ford…” she says quietly.
“Yes, Little Red?”
“That was better than my books.”
I laugh, pressing a kiss to her head. “I'm glad. Now sleep. I have more
plans for you later.”

TESSA
Ford wasn't joking when he said he had more plans for me.
Two hours after our shower, I woke up to his mouth on my pussy. He
ate me until I was shaking from head to toe. After that, he made me hold on
to the headboard while he fucked me into oblivion. Then, we took another
shower, and I took my turn worshipping his cock until he spilled down my
throat like he'd wanted.
When we returned to bed, he made love to me slowly and gently. It was
so different than what had transpired between us before but just as amazing,
if not better.
My entire body aches in the best way possible. My legs are sore, my
arms feel like jelly, and I'm pretty sure I have bruises on my tits and hips.
I wouldn't trade it for anything, especially not right now when Ford
currently has his mouth attached to my neck. He's kissing me softly, and I
keep my eyes closed, letting him do whatever he wants.
“I know you're awake, Tessa,” he murmurs against my skin.
I let out a soft laugh. “How?”
“Because over the last twelve hours, I've acquainted myself with your
body quite well. It responds to me. In fact, I bet if I slip my hand between
your legs, I will find you wet and ready for me.”
“I wouldn't be so sure.”
He lifts his head with one brow arched. “Care to make a wager?”
“Like?”
“Like, if your pussy is wet for me, I get to play with that virgin ass of
yours.”
I squeeze my thighs together at the thought of him going anywhere near
my ass. It's always been something I've wanted to explore, but I've never
found someone I trust enough.
Ford, though? I trust him completely. He's honest and open and has
treated me with nothing but respect our entire time together. I've never been
with someone so tuned in to my body and so communicative during sex.
“I'll take that bet.”
He narrows his eyes for a moment but doesn't say anything. Instead, he
drags his hand down my body in a slow, feathery light line and doesn't stop
until he's slipping a finger through my very, very wet pussy.
Fine. So I tricked him. Can I really be blamed?
“Looks like I win.”
Before I can react, he flips me onto my back and grabs my hips, pulling
me to my hands and knees. He palms my cheeks, spreading me and
exposing the spot nobody has ever touched.
“Oh, I'm going to enjoy this.”
It's all the warning I have before his mouth is on me, kissing my most
forbidden spot. I moan as he traces soft circles over my hole, working me
open with his tongue and dipping inside me.
It's dirty. It's wrong. It shouldn't be happening.
But there isn't a single part of me that wants him to stop.
He laughs when I push back against him, needing more. He obliges by
sliding a single finger into my throbbing pussy, fucking me with his digit
while he fucks my ass with his tongue. It's heavenly, and I decide I never
want to leave this hotel room. I couldn't bear walking away from this
pleasure.
My orgasm builds and builds. Having him in my pussy and ass is too
much but not enough all at once. I'm getting closer to my release, but I need
something else. I've learned enough so far to know I can't do anything
without permission.
“Ford…”
It's a plea, and he knows it.
“Fingers on your clit, Tessa. I want to feel your asshole squeeze my
tongue as you come.”
I don't waste a second, drawing circles over myself until I fall apart and
fulfill his wish. He eats me through my orgasm, not letting up for a single
second as I ride it out.
Ford pushes off the bed and pads to the bathroom. I hear him unscrew a
bottle then the distinct sound of swishing before he spits into the sink.
I collapse onto the bed in a heap of satisfaction. I've never come so
much in my life. I feel more satisfied than ever, but I also feel like there is
no way this night will ever be enough. I can't believe I didn't know this
man yesterday, and now I can't imagine anything better than him touching
me.
I don't want to give this up.
Ford climbs back into bed, wrapping his arm around my waist and
dragging me back to him. It's the same position we've been in practically
all night—well, when we aren't fucking, that is. It's comfortable. It feels
right.
I run my hands through his chest hair, loving how it feels beneath my
fingertips and how his hand slides softly over my back.
“How insane would you think I was if I asked you to stay with me here
again?”
I rise up, and he follows me. I don't care that the blanket has fallen to
my lap and my tits are fully displayed. He's seen everything I have to offer.
I have nothing left to hide from him.
“Are you serious?”
“Very.”
“Well, I guess my answer depends on how insane you'd think I was if I
said yes.”
“Not insane at all,” he answers without hesitation.
“Then yes.” The words tumble out of my mouth before I can think
twice, but I realize I don't need to think twice about it once they're out
there. They're true.
I want to stay with him.
We didn't just have sex all last night. When we were latched onto one
another, we talked for hours, not leaving a single subject off the table. He
told me about growing up in Canada and playing hockey, and I told him
about growing up in the Midwest and how I used to work on a farm before
school every morning. He told me about his favorite books, and I told him
about mine. I told him about my secret dream to go to New Zealand and do
the Lord of the Rings tour, and he called me a nerd but sounded interested in
it. We ended up having more in common than I ever thought possible, and,
well, I like him a lot. Way more than I anticipated.
So, yeah, I want to stay for as long as he'll have me.
He grins. “Good.”
He kisses my lips quickly, and I can't help the giggle that bubbles out of
me.
“What?” he asks, looking amused.
“I just…I can't believe I'm doing this. I meant it when I said I don't do
this. It's not really my thing. You're not really my thing. In fact, you're the
total opposite of my usual type.”
“Well, maybe that's a good thing. Clearly, those relationships didn't
work out.”
“True, but my one relationship with a jock didn't work out either.”
His eyes narrow. “I'm not that asshole, Tessa.”
“I know you're not.” And I do know he's not. I might not know know
him yet, but I do know he's nothing like my high school boyfriend. He's all
man, and right now, he's all mine.
Something hits me.
“You know, I don't even know your name.”
“Forget it already? I'm surprised—you were screaming it pretty loudly
last night.”
“I meant your real name.”
“Ah, that. Right.” He nods. “Would you believe me if I said it's
Harrison?”
I laugh. “Not a chance.”
“Smart woman.” He winks. “It's Nicholas.”
“Nicholas,” I say. “Nicholas Ford.” I test it a few times. “I like it.”
“Well, thank you, but I can't take any credit for it.”
I roll my eyes. “You're kind of annoying.”
“I know, but I'll grow on you.”
“Grow on me, huh? Not planning on letting me go any time soon?”
He laughs darkly, cupping my face with his palm and dragging my
mouth to his.
“Oh, Little Red. We're going to have so much fun together.”
It's a promise, and I can't fucking wait for him to fulfill it.

EPILOGUE
Two Years Later
Tessa
“Fucking hell. If you could see yourself right now… You look good
enough to eat, Little Red.”
“I'm kind of hoping you will.”
He laughs darkly, and I can only imagine the hungry grin he's sporting
right now.
I literally can only imagine it since I'm currently wearing a blindfold
that blocks every ounce of light.
There was a time in my life when I would have been terrified to be in
the dark like this. Mortified to be stripped naked and strapped to a bed. But
right now? There is nowhere else I could imagine being.
Especially not when I know Ford is prowling around the room. Even
with the blindfold, I can feel the hunger in his eyes. He's loving this as
much as I am, and I'm really loving it.
In the time we've been together, we've played around often. Ford has
opened me up to so many things I didn't realize I'd enjoy, like spanking,
anal play, nipple clamps, rope play, and light degradation, but this is the
first time he's taken away one of my senses like this. It's as exhilarating as
it is scary. Not because I don't trust Ford—I do with my life—but because I
can't see his next move. Not knowing what to expect…well, it has me on
edge in the best way.
“Roll over,” he instructs.
Before we started, Ford informed me he'd leave enough slack in the ties
so I could move around as much as I'd like but not be able to touch myself.
He wasn't lying, but I didn't expect the silk to be this tight when I rolled
over. It's snug and digs into my skin, but not enough to hurt and just enough
to remind me I'm at his mercy.
“Ass in the air,” he tells me.
I push to my knees the best I can, and the ties tighten even more, and I
relish the bite of pain.
“Look at you,” he murmurs, his voice needy and deep. My ass is
completely exposed, and at this angle, there's no way Ford doesn't notice
the wetness between my legs. “So perfect. So mine.”
“Yours,” I agree because I am.
I'm his in every sense of the word.
I never expected him to be at the Carolina Comets team party, but I've
never been happier to have struck up a conversation with a stranger in my
life. Ford's given so much more than I could have ever asked for, and I
don't just mean in the sex department.
He listens to me. He supports me. He takes care of me. He protects me.
He loves me.
Ever so softly, he runs his fingertips up my leg, inching closer and
closer to where I want to feel him the most. But Ford being Ford, he teases
me first, dancing his touch over the back of my knee and up to the wetness
that's now slicking my thighs, then back down again. He makes three more
passes before allowing his knuckles to graze against me.
I hiss at the contact. It's so subtle yet feels so fucking powerful.
“Please.”
I realize my mistake the second the word leaves my mouth.
Ford draws his hand away, and I whimper at the loss.
“Does your needy cunt want more, Little Read?” he asks. “Is that why
you're searching for my touch right now?”
I nod. “Yes, sir.”
“I'll give you more when I'm ready, understood?”
“I understand.”
“Good. Now, rest there. I'll be back in a moment. And Tessa?”
“Sir?”
“Don't even think about trying to rub your cunt against my sheets.”
My sheets. As if they aren't ours. As if I don't sleep in this bed next to
him every night and haven't for the last two years.
But it's all part of the little game we're playing, the one where he uses
me however he likes, and I take it, enjoying it as much as he does.
I strain to hear as he walks around the room, trying to pick up the
slightest hint of his actions, but there is none. He's too quiet. Too structured.
Then, the corner of the bed dips, and everything in me tenses with
anticipation.
I jump when his fingers brush against my ass, and he chuckles. “I've got
a plug, Little Red. Is that okay?”
“Yes.” The word comes out a sigh more than anything.
He laughs again. “Didn't think you'd mind.”
Since our first weekend together, I've gotten comfortable with Ford
playing with both of my holes, and I've come to quite like it when he uses a
plug on me. The fullness of it is unmatched, and I always look forward to
when he gets it out.
He presses the lubed glass against my exposed hole but doesn't try to
insert it. No. He teases me with it, getting me ready, making sure I'm nice
and relaxed and dying for more.
When I push back, he knows it's time. Only then does he slowly begin
to insert the toy.
He takes his time to ensure he doesn't push me too far too fast, and
when it's finally in, we both breathe a sigh of relief.
“That's my girl,” he says tenderly, rubbing my ass in soft, slow circles.
“You did so good.” He gently taps the plug, and I moan. “This looks
gorgeous, you know. So perfect.”
“Feels good.”
He cups me between my legs. “It's going to feel even better with my
cock filling this pussy, Little Red.”
“Prove it.”
I'm pushing my luck. I know I am. But Ford must be as needy as I am
because he doesn't punish me for it.
No. Instead, I hear the unmistakable sound of his zipper being pulled
down the track and feel him brushing against the backs of my legs as he
settles behind me, and I know I'm in for it.
“I'm going to fuck you hard for that one, Tessa.”
Well, that's not much of a threat.
I open my mouth to tell him that, but the sarcastic words vanish as he
slams into me without warning.
It's hard. It's rough. It's the punishment I expected. And it feels so, so
fucking good.
He pounds into me over and over, and I love every second of it until I
realize I can't touch myself. I can't do anything other than take this, even
though I know my orgasm—the one I'm absolutely dying for—is so damn
close, and all it would take is one press to my clit, and I'd be a goner.
“You're close,” he observes, like this isn't even affecting him.
“So close.”
“That's too bad, hmm? Because I'm not.”
I groan, and he laughs, enjoying this far too much.
He continues to thrust into me, and I'm unable to do anything other than
let him.
My legs begin to shake with exhaustion, and my shoulders grow tight
from being bound and having to hold myself up.
Ford notices.
“Are you ready, Little Red? Do you want to come?”
I whimper, unable to form a complete sentence at this point. It's not
enough for him. He wants my words.
He slaps my ass, causing me to clench around the plug, and I moan.
“Tell me. Tell me you want to come.”
“I…”
Another slap.
“I want to come,” I finally manage to get out. “Please, Ford. Please let
me come.”
“Only because you asked so nicely…”
Then his fingers are on my clit, and the small touch is all it takes for me
to explode around him.
My body is on fire as I come, everything that was hurting turning to
liquid as the tension dissipates, leaving me limp.
Ford pounds into me several more times before following me over the
edge and spilling himself inside of me with a guttural groan of my name.
He pulls out of me slowly, then reaches forward and undoes the ties. I
collapse onto the bed, unable to hold myself up any longer.
Ford follows me down, lying behind me and holding me close as we
catch our breaths. He finally undoes the blindfold, letting it fall away, but I
keep my eyes closed, not wanting to let this moment go.
“You were incredible,” he whispers, his fingertips roaming over my hip
and belly. “I'm so proud of you, Tessa.”
“Thank you.” He knows I don't mean for the compliment but for caring
for me afterward. He always does, and it's always almost as good as the
orgasm.
He continues to explore me with his fingers, pinching my nipples
lightly, then trailing them down to my sensitive core. He plays with me
gently with no intention of starting things back up, but my body doesn't get
the memo. I'm tired, yet eager for more, especially with his thumb on my
clit.
“You know,” he says conversationally like I'm not rocking against his
touch, begging for more. “I was thinking we should get married.”
I halt my movements. “You think…” I swallow. “You think we should
get married?”
He nods against me. “Yes. We should. What do you think?”
I sputter out a laugh. “I think you have your fingers on my pussy, and
your plug is in my ass, and you just proposed to me.”
“Is it really so shocking?”
I chuckle, rolling toward him. “No, Ford. It's really not.”
His blue eyes are striking this close, and I don't think I'll ever get used
to it. Not even if we had a lifetime together, and I really want a lifetime
together.
“What do you think, Tessa?” He cradles my face with his hand, pressing
his thumb that was just between my legs against my bottom lip, and I'm
unable to stop myself from darting my tongue out. He tastes like us. “You
want to get married?”
“Is this real?”
“The ring in the top drawer of my bedside table says it is.”
“You got me a ring?”
“I got you a ring, Little Red.”
Tears spring to my eyes. He means this. It's not a joke. It's not a spurof-the-moment thing.
He wants this, and I do, too.
“So what do you say?” he prompts.
“Yes,” I tell him. “Yes, I'll marry you, Nicholas Ford.”
He closes his eyes, pressing his forehead against mine. “Oh, thank fuck.
There's a no refund policy on the ring.”
I laugh, pressing a kiss to his lips. “Good because I plan to keep it
forever.”
“Mine,” he whispers against me.
“Always,” I promise.
We make love again and then begin planning a nighttime summer
wedding on the rooftop where we met.
THE END
CAROLINA COMETS GROUP CHAT
Miller: Well, well, well. Lookie what I stumbled across.
Miller: It's our old group chat!
Miller: How much do you guys miss me???
Greer: For fuck's sake…
Wright: No.
Rhodes: Not a chance.
Lowell: Literally not at all.
Fitzy: I kinda miss you…
Greer: Wow. Way to ruin it, good boy.
Fitzy: I'm not a good boy.
Fitzy: Wait. No. Maybe I am. Someone tell Rosie.
Miller: Ew, guys, come on. Let's not talk about sex and the
kinky shit you guys are into.
Greer: Yeah, we don't want to hurt the virgin's feelings
because he's having very vanilla sex.
Miller: Hey! I am not a virgin! Anymore. I'm like a total sex god
now. Just ask Scout.
Miller: And also, there is NOTHING wrong with vanilla sex.
Wright: I thought we weren't discussing sex.
Rhodes: You're just scared because you know if Harper found
out you were discussing your sex life, she'd chop your balls
off and smile while doing it.
Greer: I'm team no talking about sex, especially where Miller
is involved.
Miller: Come on… Don't be that way, brother.
Greer: I am NOT your brother.
Miller: YET. Not yet. But once I ask Scout to marry me, and
she inevitably says yes, we're brothers. Deal with it.
Greer: Have I mentioned how much I hate you lately?
Miller: Only every day. But I can read between the lines. I
know it's love.
Rhodes: Wow. Someone's delusional.
Wright: Can't believe Scout dates you.
Miller: Oh, she more than dates me. You should hear what
she did to me last night.
Miller: Spoiler alert: It was NAUGHTY.
Smith: I don't even play anymore. How am I still in this chat?
Miller: Aw, guys, he's so old he already forgot that I said it was
our chat from back in the day when we made our second Cup
run.
Miller: In case you already forgot about that too, Apple, but
YOU WERE OUR VIDEO COACH AND WE WON.
Smith: God, I hope the Serpents beat the shit out of you this
season.
Rhodes: And by you, he means you in particular, Miller. Not
the rest of us.
Smith: Oh, no. I hope the Serpents take you all down.
Rhodes: Well, that's just plain rude.
Wright: You know we gotta beat your ass now, right?
Lowell: On the ice. Just to be clear. No need to start
threatening the elderly.
Smith: I truly don't miss you idiots at all.
Fitzy: That's a lie.
Greer: He misses us soooo much.
Smith: Trust me, I have my own group of idiots to wrangle
now. They don't give me much room to miss you.
Greer: My brother, Lucas, being the biggest idiot of them all.
Wright: I don't know. Have you met Miller?
Miller: HEY NOW!
Rhodes: What? You know he's right.
Miller: Fine. He's a little bit right. But just so you know, I'm
totally pouting right now.
Miller: P.S. I still miss you all.
Wright: Shut up, Miller.
Rhodes: Shut up, Miller.
Greer: Shut up, Miller.
Smith: Shut up, Miller.
Lowell: Shut up, Miller.
Fitzy: Shut up, Miller.
Miller: Even you, Fitzy? Damn. That one hurts.
Fitzy: Sorry.
Wright: Don't apologize to him. He doesn't deserve it.
Rhodes: He really doesn't. Did I tell you guys he sent me a
video of him singing Miley Cyrus for the Fourth of July? He
was definitely partying in the USA.
Lowell: Wait. He sent me that video too.
Greer: Fucking hell. I hate that karaoke machine. Why's he
always carrying it around everywhere?
Fitzy: I think he has a nice voice.
Rhodes: Fuck's sake, Fitzy. You're done.
Fitzy: What? I'm just trying to be nice. He's gone quiet. I think
we've hurt his feelings.
Wright: Aww, Miller. We hurt your wittle baby fweelings?
Rhodes: If you're crying, do it quietly. I don't want to hear that
shit.
Greer: Not a fucking peep.
Lowell: I hear enough crying with all these damn kids at
home.
Wright: That's all your fault, you know.
Lowell: Yeah, yeah. I know. I wouldn't change it, though. I love
them.
Miller: Say with me now: AWWWWW!
Rhodes: Dammit. I thought we got rid of him.
Miller: You kidding me? I'm never leaving you guys. I love you
dudes too much.
Greer: Take that back.
Miller: Never.
Miller: In fact…
Miller: Collin Wright, I love you.
Wright: Please don't.
Miller: Adrian Rhodes, I love you.
Rhodes: Swear I'm punching you the next time I see you.
Miller: Ivan Fitzgerald, I love you.
Fitzy: Thanks, man. Love you too.
Miller: Cameron Lowell, I love you.
Lowell: Don't.
Miller: Owen Smith, I love you.
Smith: That's it. I'm blocking this chat.
Greer: Don't you fucking dare, Miller.
Miller: Jacob Greer, I LOVE YOU, BROTHER.
Greer: Love me less. I'm begging you.
Greer: And for the hundredth time, I'M NOT YOUR
BROTHER.
Miller: And for the hundredth time, YET. We're not brothers
YET.
Wright: What ARE you going to do when he and Scout get
married, Greer?
Greer: Cry.
Miller: Because you're so happy for us, right?
Greer: No. Because I'll finally know there really is no escaping
you.
Miller: You don't mean that.
Greer: Every fucking word.
Rhodes: I am so glad my wife doesn't have any sisters, so I
don't have to deal with this shit.
Lowell: Wright and I are BILs. We make it work.
Greer: Yeah, but Wright isn't Miller. That means it's
automatically statistically easier to like him.
Rhodes: I don't know, man. Have you ever had to share a
room with Wright?
Wright: Hey! I'm a great roommate.
Miller: Let's test it. Sleepover at my place?
Greer: No.
Miller: Aw, come on! We could all bring tents and camp in the
backyard.
Rhodes: Right. Sure. And we can make s'mores in your
firepit.
Wright: Tell ghost stories and drink beer.
Lowell: Order pizza and eat candy until we're going to puke.
Fitzy: Does anyone else think this actually sounds fun?
Wright: I wasn't going to say it, but FUCK YES.
Rhodes: I was in with pizza.
Lowell: The WAGS could do a sleepover inside? Don't want to
leave them out.
Wright: Harper would be bummed she's missing the ghost
stories, though.
Rhodes: She can tell them inside. I doubt Ryan would want to
sleep in a tent.
Lowell: I wouldn't want to share a tent with a beast either.
Rhodes: Remember that time I punched you? I'll do it again.
Smith: Boys…
Miller: LOL, the old man is the voice of reason.
Wright: Shut up, Miller.
Smith: Thanks, Wright. I was just typing that myself.
Miller: But you're old and slow and can't type that fast, right?
Rhodes: Shut up, Miller.
Miller: Ugh. FINE.
Miller: So… sleepover?
Wright: I'm in.
Rhodes: Sure.
Fitzy: I'll bring the marshmallows!
Lowell: You are a marshmallow, Fitzy.
Lowell: And yeah, I guess I'm in.
Miller: Greer?
Greer: Absolutely not.
Miller: Come on… It'll be fun!
Greer: Not a fucking chance.
Miller: Don't be grumpy, brother.
Greer: Not. Your. Brother.
Miller: Not. Yet. Brother.
Miller: Please? I'll be your best friend!
Wright: That's a horrible deal. Don't take it, Greer.
Miller: Hey, I am a fantastic best friend! Just ask Fitzy!
Fitzy: We're best friends?
Miller: WOW.
Miller: Wow, wow, wow, WOW.
Miller: I'm hurt, Fitzy Baby. Absolutely torn up inside.
Greer: You're not. Shut up.
Miller: Please come to my sleepover, Greer. PLEASE?!
Greer: Will you stop calling me your brother?
Miller: I swear I won't say another word about it until we're
actually brothers.
Wright: Now that's a bargain I'd take.
Rhodes: Take the deal, Greer.
Lowell: What Beast said. It's the best you'll get, and you know
it.
Greer: Fine. Deal. I'll go to your dumb sleepover.
Miller: YESSSSS!
Miller: You won't regret it.
Greer: I already do.
Miller: Smith? You coming?
Smith: No way in hell.
Miller: Aww, come on!
Smith: No. And you have nothing to bribe me with, so my
answer will remain no.
Miller: Actually, I do.
Miller: Remember that one time you were all sad and mopey
because you had to stop seeing Emilia because of her
promotion? So you came to me crying, and I came up with a
plan to help you win her back? Because I do. Now, come to
my sleepover.
Wright: WAIT A DAMN MINUTE
Rhodes: YOU WENT TO MILLER FOR HELP?!
Lowell: NO FUCKING WAY.
Greer: Wow. I used to respect you so much, Apple.
Fitzy: I think it's great he went to a teammate for help.
Wright: …Smith? Anything to say?
Smith: Fuck.
Smith: Yeah, fine. That happened.
Smith: But just so we're clear, it wasn't exactly like that. Yes, I
was upset, but no, I did not ask Miller for help. He inserted
himself into it because he's Miller. His plan just happened to
work out.
Rhodes: So… you still owe him?
Lowell: Sounds like it to me.
Wright: Yeah, sorry, bud. You're coming.
Smith: I'll be there.
Miller: FUCK YES!
Miller: Bring your sleeping bags and pillows, boys, because
it's a SLEEPOVER AT MY PLACE!
Wright: I'm kind of excited. Especially for ghost stories. I've
got some good ones.
Rhodes: A night with the boys doesn't sound so bad.
Fitzy: I can't wait for s'mores. I fucking love marshmallows.
Lowell: The WAGS are going to love it too.
Greer: I hate this team.
Miller: Lies! You love it. You love us. I love you.
Wright: Ughhh. Shut up, Miller.
Rhodes: Shut up, Miller.
Smith: Shut up, Miller.
Lowell: Shut up, Miller.
Greer: What they said.
Miller: Never. Not ever. Want to know why?
Miller: Carolina Comets forever, baby.
Wright: Damn straight!
Lowell: Hell yeah!
Rhodes: Always!
Fitzy: Hear, hear!
Smith: Hmm.
Miller: Greer?
Greer: Yeah, yeah, Comets forever and all that mushy shit.
Miller: Love you…brother.
Greer: SHUT UP, MILLER!

THANK YOU
I hope you enjoyed the Carolina Comets and all their
shenanigans.
If you'd like to see what the characters are up to now, check out my Seattle
Serpents hockey series, where many of the characters make an appearance
(or two…or three). The first book, Body Check, is a forbidden romance
that features a grumpy hockey player gunning to become captain and a
billionaire heroine he's supposed to stay away from. If you liked the group
chat from the Comets, you'll love the Seattle Serpents!
Consider the Texting Series for a series that's set not too far from the world
of the Carolina Comets. The Texting Series features a few side characters
you just met (agent Shep, Zach, Delia, and more). It's fun, light-hearted,
and goofy. If you enjoyed the texting in this Comets series, you'll love the
Texting books.
If you like small-town, found-family vibes, try the Slice Series. It's a
collection of romcoms set in a charming little pizzeria on the East Coast
near where the Comets and Texting series takes place.
Like roommate romantic comedies? Then I have the perfect series for you
because all four books in the Roommate Romps series follow that trope.
Thank you for taking this wild ride with me.
